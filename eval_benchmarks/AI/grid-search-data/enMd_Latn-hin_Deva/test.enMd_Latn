For example, I gave the example like Sachin gave his bat to Sarfaraz, the ownership is transferred from Sachin to Sarfaraz.
We’re going to have a quantitative representation of goodness of the state.
Once that is done, okay once we get that those values static evaluation function now try to understand how we learn about win, lose or draw.
And the CD representation look pretty pretty superficial on the face of it.
Now he everything cricket stadium and playing cricket and all that is there in these two statements but actually watching a match does not happen here.
Because of that, your chatbot can provide answers relevant to user input.
If you avoid eighteen moves for example, the entire eighteen sub trees are pruned from the search tree.
Suppose it finds the food source, it follows the same path to come back.
We have also seen that it is possible to write multiple ways Okay .
One major challenge that we have stressed is to choose a move.
However, beginning with the collapse of the Lisp Machine market in 1987, AI once again fell into disrepute, and a second, longer-lasting hiatus began.
So, there are a few thumbs of rule, the knowledge segment should be as small as possible and they should contain knowledge chunks in a way that conventional law of cohesion and coupling is maintained.
So, after primitives, the next thing is CD .
Both methods are used in factors.
With that, we'll come to a close.
We are pouring either the milk in five gallon jug or three gallon jug.
So that's what precisely it is doing?
Suppose if you have a company where there are thousands of employees working and you would like to retain them.
If the root node is reached and no further children to be explored, the search process ends there unsuccessfully.
Now you can even compare that with neural networks that you have seen in the previous module.
The deep bidirectional recurrent neural network predicts label sequence with some relation between the characters.
So, like that when you encounter a statement where you can replace that placeholder, it is it is done that way.
Similarly, Sarfaraz took a bat from Sachin will also have the same thing because it’s basically, essentially the same thing.
We have so far looked at the MiniMax algorithm itself where the structure node info, the recursive version of the algorithm, three different components of a recursive algorithm and how MiniMax actually does all this jobs, how MiniMax algorithm continuous recursively calls itself till it reaches the leaf node and applying static evolution function there and then backs the value up in the unwinding part and chooses the best move.
In the translation process with post-editing, the source material is first translated into the target language with machine translation, and a human editor then reviews and corrects the translation.
So, there are two components and we can pick up the shortest tour based on addition of this two components, okay .
Delta is the difference between the objective function value of the current state and the new state, okay .
Because if you don't do this, it’ll not have that level of acceptance in user.
So, that is represented here that this conceptualization, which is which is vertical, ‘Sachin PTRANS Sachin to plane.
The first case is one, the second case is one.
And a good designer of script can actually assume all possible cases, those scenes which might probably occur and all that and keep them there.
The essence is picked up and used.
One epoch is said to be over.
You can see that in the third one also you have a cycle.
There is one example shown in the slide, you better see.
And that's why, it is possible to build programs which can play chess.
sneeze And there's one more thing.
From them, customers may get information crucial to their purchase decision that cannot be found elsewhere.
Branch and bound is for other problems as well.
Unwinding accumulates the path.
These issues have been explored by myth, fiction and philosophy since antiquity.
If you if you look at the search process that is that is described earlier you move in this direction and this direction and this direction you may feel that it’s quite jittery.
Okay you can see that script it contains few things one is called entry condition.
Because things are decided, things are processed and not only that, they they also require to change more frequently than conventional systems.
So I I don't need to worry about that rule, okay .
Which contain two things, the the best move that I take next and the paths, okay the the heuristic value, the complete path and the depth, okay two things.
Okay , let let us look at this thing in in a little more classic way.
And let us pick up the first rule and you can see in your handout that the rule is pretty simple, which which connects a picture producer or an actor with an act and is a double sided arrow which is used which talks about which which conveys that is a double dependency and it it uses.
The annealing schedule determines the amount of worst moves to be allowed okay .
You require multiple interfaces.
We can pour the water out of the jug.
Goals can be explicitly defined or induced.
The other point which I talked about threat of fork which is shown in the next slide, you can see that.
So, you can use them.
Now here, please understand, there are two different problems.
So the call here is is current state zero current player.
It contain two things, one is path, which is basically a string talking about more X and Y than Z and so on.
Here an example is Abdul decided to earn more money.
In this particular module, we are going to see simple , simplest of them called Unguided Search Methods .
Because when you talk about anything, it depends on context.
And I've already told you that it is shorter paths are preferred and there is a PPT which talks about that and what I’m I've already told you the other thing, that if there is some change in the path, the optimal path changes.
Now, watching a match he has to be there in the stadium and and to travel by bus he has to be there on on the bus stand.
Now, you may be surprised why the first cycle is repeated again.
You said that I'm going to use NMR or I'm going to add fuzzy component in it, or I'll use certainty factors here.
It lets you create a more natural flow of conversation.
So, you may write a program to do it.
I have reached to D.
Action is described by this primitive and many times it is called ACT or action.
And how it is done?
You probably have seen that thing yourself and we’re going to write, we’re going to discuss about the algorithm which does the same thing.
Now there is the first one, Okay .
The first one selects the best members of the population, remember I was talking about five out of twenty.
A good example of training a machine translation engine is a situation where a repeating error occurs in the translations produced by the engine, such as the English names of weekdays written in lower case.
okay When we look at the function I'll again remind you that place.
okay There are three arguments passed to the algorithm, the current player the depth value and the heuristic of players identity.
The second representation.
And this connections are dynamic, they change over a period of time and this connections are weighted , they they contain weights and this weights basically carries the knowledge that we have in our brain.
It's very hard for me to decide whether this value is very, the estimate is very correct or not.
There are dependencies between these paths in the self-attention layer. 
Basically, what we want in neural network solution is to mimic brain, human brain.
Okay , so for one conceptualization the other conceptualization is used as an object.
Then in the next cycle what we do is in fact, Depth Bound Depth-first search, actually explores everything like the previous case and then it starts looking for the solution like this. You can see that.
Then we will pick up the shortest city, the nearest city from that city and so on.
Regression is coming back from the goal state.
Because at leaf node we have the most this heuristic function or static evaluation functions are what?
At present, machine translation can well be used, for instance, for non-public, company-internal communication and information sharing, especially when the content of the text needs to be transmitted quickly but the text is not distributed to a large audience.
So, that kind of an alternate path is if provided in the script, one can even reason with that and can clearly conclude that dining does not happen and obviously payment also does not happen.
They are not same.
Approaches include statistical methods, computational intelligence, and traditional symbolic AI.
Its comparatively much simpler to represent .
And in some cases, they’re applied in a hybrid way.
You choose if there is a dead end you can always try the other path.
For example, Garry Kasparov, the Deep Blue machine which IBM build which has beaten Garry Kasparov three-two if you remember there it was there in news for quite some time.
We’ll be discussing about conceptual dependency.
I when I suggest a patient to to get X-ray, how many times I’m I'm right in in saying so because at that point of time the fracture evident.
So, if farmer is on one side, the other side, you can't have farm.
For example, a cricket player usually are is taller than normal people.
Also, 24 is not properly bounded in the box.
You start with the solution, and then continue refining that solution.
So pheromone value is some constant value divided by the length.
The solution could have gone in different direction, pick up the fourth step.
It is about having some predefined primitives and predefined links to be used for representing general English statements and any other language statements.
One of them is called simulated hill climbing for example.
So, winding phase happens before you make the recursive call okay if you read any recursive algorithms you've taken up any programming course, you probably know what I am talking about.
So, one is the actual distance, the other is estimated distance and based on that you will figure, you will find out which path is more promising, and we'll explore that path first.
Even in household today, robots have becoming pretty common today.
But that is quite acceptable.
okay And that's very important.
Okay .
Traveling salesman problem for example, when we talk about, if you want to get the tour which is optimal we may start with a random tour A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H or something here A, B, C, D, E, F are are are cities.
He used that and most of the other books also and other representations where I've seen, they are like that.
So for each word, we create a Query vector, a Key vector, and a Value vector. 
So let us first of all begin with deep breath the state space definition that we we already have on on the slide.
But you will have to actually now how that is done?
Okay , but the third one even human reader cannot get what it is.
Remember, we are discussed about the dictionary approach somewhere back and machine learning that we are going to look at next contains something similar.
Now, what’s tricky about this?
N is not possible to determine we’ll have to go further NL.
So, I don't need to go further.
In this post, we will look at The Transformer – a model that uses attention to boost the speed with which these models can be trained.
So, we we we begin from an initial state, we move across in the state space using moves that we have.
Now, applying this, two calculations place on table A dot addition intersection goal state, you can see that goal state on A table.
Anyway, now you can see that there is a deviation from a normal sequence which clearly indicates that there is something wrong.
In some case, it it it goes beyond million.
The What are those types?
So out of ten if I if I can only change two.
So, what you do is you just pick up the first segment and this.
The reviews are typically translated into the language of the customer's web browser.
We just say that A B C D is not equal to six, twelve or four.
We have seen that how CD different rules of CD can can be used to represent statements.
Simulated annealing is is a method where you allow the worst move from the the current move unlike hill climbing with a typical amount of probability that is derived from physical process of annealing and uses almost similar method for choosing how much with how much how how many how much probability you allow the the incorrect move sorry not incorrect it is less this thing a worse move from a current current move and so on.
So, these are two important principles of simulated annealing.
And it is based on the idea of how life forms persist.
So you can look at that and decide.
You continue doing that eventually what you get a better solution set hopefully.
You have to have some values constraints on those values here.
The the beauty is that it stores information in distributed fashion and not a localized fashion like computer programs.
For square it is not, okay .
okay , so static evaluation function is a very good, very important thing, fundamental thing for game playing.
Now we take the right child of 8 , Okay .
It says that M one number of missionaries and C one number of cannibals are on the left hand side of the river.
There are some description about that as well which is not part of our this thing .
A on table is added and because A is resting on B, okay A is resting on B, B B becomes free.
As I said, it is cheating and is not desirable.
Learning faster is not always advisable.
See the left most node which is already explored.
If this value is better, make this a current state and best so far is new state.
For example, Sachin is clever, that clever is an attribute of Sachin.
Now, let me repeat what I'm talking about.
In missionary cannibal Sorry, it’s milk jug problem, sorry, it’s zero, zero, zero minus ten.
So, they are they are represented here.
A same is the case with three A.
This one.
Point is, is a huge distributed interconnected dynamic structure.
Now everything is assumed you can see that in single statement, I'm talking about multiple things together the complete scenario now when you talk about scripts, scripts are these scenarios, Okay
What does it mean?
Now why should I be not exploring the next one?
The same thing is used by similar thing is used by the programs, okay .
An interesting exercise that you can pick up and the try out is - Can you write a single rule converting these two rules into one?
The bounding box can be created around the text through the sliding window technique.
You need a powerful server and with this this kind of knowledge extraction process, which can tell you exactly what this packet is doing.
So , it is basically hill climbing but with little randomness.
So, this is these are the initial and final state.
When it finds something which is unusual, something which is not mentioned in the scene at all Okay , it can understand.
That's a restriction.
Once this is done, then the actual processing of algorithm starts from now on, because now we have some value of pheromone set for all segments.
It should help you understand the basics of chatbot technology, and let you read and talk about it with ease.
okay , these words probably we are not going to use them anywhere else.
Fortunately, for us the empirical studies the the practical solutions to this problem proved that it is actually possible for almost all cases.
It will travel A, B and C and now travelling towards now when they reach to that obstacle, they have two options.
We decide what we want to achieve.
How can one write the moves, the the eleven twelve moves, how can you start from the initial state, apply moves and restore solution
To select some you may use a function, which is quite similar to heuristic function but here it is called a fitness function.
Yes, we can do it because we only have seven cities here, we'll we'll be able to do it very easily.
okay , you can see that the state's evaluator, the next slide talks about that thing and we’ll label it in either of the three cases – win, lose and draw and you can see that they are already done.
Here it is shown as tau T plus one.
And what is being expelled?
So, there are multiple initial, multiple final states possible in in other problems.
Ten is the maximum and minus ten is the minimum value, so when you say health equal to minus ten, the person is dead.
E F G H is also farmer, fox, chicken, grain but then some other values.
So, you say that Milkha Singh PTRANS himself, okay .
There is a convolutional implementation of the sliding window which can reduce the computational time.
You can see that I saw the match, I watched the match and so on so forth, all similar statements will have similar representation, but the saw match represent the same thing I watched a match and I MTRANS match where the the recipient case relationship from my eyes to my conceptual processor CP.
Please remember to write M one equal to zero, otherwise you cannot solve this problem.
And you have to continuously meet and learn from expert in this particular case duration.
For example, or or or critical cases like king is under attack, threat of fork which is basically mimicking how human player works okay , which obviously will take more time, explore more number of nodes and also look at more number of moves and also deeper.
I’ll have eight eight into eight matrix and provide positions of the pieces on the board which which in turn is the representation of a chessboard.
So that is called nearest neighbour.
So, that simplifies our description.
Whenever you explore a node, whenever you generate children for a node what if the child is already explored.
The next slide talks about the same.
The next one is called sigmoid.
We will just see that soon.
But in case of this thing , expert system, you probably have more than one beta releases and so on so forth.
So, same way D and N is the next combo and N is what it chooses.
Minus nine is worse than my minus three.
So, if you do that you probably will start with one and then the other so placing D on the table.
So, that also is possible.
The undisputed strength of machine translation is the speed of the translation process.
These are four prerequisites.
You hear the record and organize the knowledge structure.
In in the slide, you will see that there is an additional value one which is provided, w one one, w two one, w three one, w n one.
Today, machine translation works best in scenarios where a text needs to be conveyed in an understandable form in another language.
Not better value, you generate the other children and so on, so forth.
So, all in all, we are going to see how heuristic function is applied in in other search methods.
But then there are other preconditions.
So default when default thing do change when the sequence is not observed when the statement indicates that the normal default sequence is is is not observed it disturbed somewhere.
And using this method actually many other problems are also solved.
Now we have that initial state and final state.
Because, depending on those values you can determine whether it is possible to apply that rule or not.
We do not want any cycles in the solution path.
So, you'll have to get some consensus on it if you have a team of experts.
‘Crying’ means tears coming out of eyes.
So, state space has some component and the end state also or the goal state also has some components.
You may try one more function.
So, it can always do it.
and in in in making sure that the enemy does not, the the prey does not get the the hint of their moving, so that they are on prowl.
That information is directly copied in and you don't even require expert’s help there because that is readily available, you just have to convert that thing to digital form.
okay The only point left out so far in this particular discussion, what will be the first call?
So, that heuristic value of one cell where we have the value and other two are empty is better, has higher heuristic value than a cell where we occupy that thing and two others are occupied by opponent.
So, whenever an electrochemical signal arrives at neuron, the the dendrites will capture that, send that thing to the nucleus, the nucleus process process is that and then send it across over Axon.
So, the first thing that they wanted to do is is to have a neuron which they call artificial neuron.
Second is position.
The program actually indicated that there is possibly a similar reason here.
Okay , for example, when I say, Milkha Singh PTRANS , it’s called a single conceptualization, when we talked about predicate logic, Okay , we we used a structure and we call that thing a predicate, here we call that thing as as a conceptualization.
I'm not going to talk about that because little more complex and more confusing, please understand that these are simple primitives and you can order them in multiple ways to represent the same meaning.
That's all.
The sigma does what?
Okay
It should follow exactly how a doctor should the patient should consult a conventional doctor, okay , the same way if he can or little better acceptable.
And when information is missing, like ‘Sachin flew to LA’ and all that, where where where the information is not complete.
After ten iterations.
In the next module, we’ll be looking at how these particular simpler forms can be combined into representing complex statements.
So, place on top BA is to be inversely applied to get BA on top of the table okay .
If it is not, it will add the component which is not solved again.
We begin with the exploration.
That person is six point two inches tall or height greater than average is example of is taller than an average cricket player.
We’ll look at the first method and that method is again pretty simple.
If A is positive, E has to be negative.
And there are similar cases.
It is basically summation of all ants and their pheromones.
So, that is deleted.
So, for example, the input layer, we have five neurons - one two three four five.
A dot preconditions so preconditions this is how you get the previous state.
If the opponent makes a mistake, I may even get five.
Same.
They are called I’m I'm calling them other search methods some in fact we are going to have one more module after that which we are we are going to discuss some typical search methods.
Because the partial part is Okay copied and then the mapping of that is used in crossover, let us try to see how it works.
Let us take a very simple example.
That is exactly what happens in in in some cases artificial worlds are created where the solutions are sent and then will pick up those who survive and so so on.
So, that means M missionaries and C cannibals moving from left hand side to right hand side.
Those problems were quite structured, quite structured in the sense that we can define something called a start state, something called a ninth state, we can define states space and we can define rules which can let us move around in state space, moving from start state to the end state.
Now let us look at the next method called Depth-first search or DFS.
Adding more filters for processing the image would help in improving the performance of the model.
For all source and destination you will be able to get this.
Natural language processing
Think of it.
We have seen three representations but believe me there are hundred odd representations one can easily write, even more, potentially infinite in fact.
This is precisely what this particular statement says.
It’s not going to help us much we need a little more precise information for which we’ll use we use SEF Static Evaluation Functions and static evaluation function are applied on a state and gives us the merit of that state based on some range that we provide.
There is something wrong.
You will be surprised where is that farmer present, not present and all that has gone.
ok W. B chooses obviously the player B or player two chooses minimum value of static evaluation function.
Number of hidden units is taken as a geometric mean of input and output.
So, word love is used in many forms, but basically the meaning out of this is that Ram loves Sita is is the essence of the statement and that is basically represented.
Do you believe that the script watching a match will be invoked?
So, we again > go back to our trivial problems that we have seen in the second module and we are going to explore them little further here and we'll see how one can apply these strategies.
Sub-fields have also been based on social factors (particular institutions or the work of particular researchers).
Both of them are misclassification.
Most of of the cases what we do is we provide a cap, say that when it reaches ninety percent, nine point nine , we accept that thing or minus point one then you accept that thing as well.
What it does is pretty complex.
Well, some authors even get even use real values as well.
There is no search .
The new state is now free B okay because you have placed A on the table so that on BA on AB is gone.
Explore two plies, B is the worst move.
It is one kind of, is is one type of engineering, one engineering discipline actually.
okay , A is already there so we have a cycle.
You check for abnormal cases as well, which is not possible in conventional cases.
One more thing is that it’s capable of using looking at fuzzy things and manage.
If it is the case, you say that the progression is relevant otherwise not.
We try with different window size to not miss the text portion with different size.
And here is an example, we start with a random side of parents say twenty and then find their fitness values and choose better five, generate thirty offspring, how you get, because there are fifteen distinct pairs of five offspring that which which which generate two children so you get thirty. Okay .
Friends, welcome to the Seventeenth module of AI .
A quip in Tesler's Theorem says AI is whatever hasn't been done yet.
If you pass the complete value up and the graph is shown in the next slide, you can see that there's not much of a difference.
Now A B C D is what?
We are showing the last city, right now we will not be showing it in other slides.
okay So, heuristic value also is negated.
Plausible move generator is assumed here.
Okay , I could actually have written that as well.
The job is done.
And the second principle of GA is that when better elements when better individuals meet they produce even better offspring.
It deviates from that script and and that's why many things described in the default format of the script does not happen.
So, we’ll take the right child of 3,5,0 and we get one.
So, those XJ and WJ are multiplied okay .
If there is a cycle you’re not moving further, you're circulating at the same place.
For example, animate objects like Sachin and sometimes even natural forces can also be used in CD as the actors, Okay .
It is also possible.
What is the solution?
This is rule one which talks about a very simple relation between PP and ACT , okay .
