moving ahead further an independent director neither himself not his relatives may hold or held the position of a key managerial personnel or has been in the employment of the company in the last three preceding financial year immediately preceding financial year in which he is proposed to be appointed.
Say for example: he is in 15-16 is the financial year.
In which independent director is proposed to be appointed.
Then proceeding three financial years that is your 14-15 , 13-14 and 12-13.
These are the three years in which he should not be engaged with a company as a key managerial personnel or as an employee.
Similarly, It he has not been an employer or proprietor of or a partner in any of the three financial years immediately preceding financial year.
In what in a form of auditor of Auditor or company secretaries in practice or cost auditors of the company or its holding subsidiary or associate or any legal or a consulting firm.
That has or had any transactions with the company its holding subsidiary or associate company amounting to 10% or more of a gross turnover of the such firms.
So, you can see where Independence is cast upon, and again a pecuniary relationship or a sustaining relationship.
So, suppose a company or a person who is head of that company secretaryâ€™s practice and he has been Company Secretary of a company ,he cannot be appointed as an independent director, because he has drawn pecuniary relationship from the company.
Similarly, if he is a legal or Consulting firm of that particular company, he cannot be independent director because he has drawn money from those particular company so that is why it is very important and the amount is also mentioned 10% or more of a gross turnover of such firm.
For example: if a firm has a legal firm, has a gross turnover of Rs.1 lakh rupees and he got around Rs 15,000 rupees from ex-company.
He cannot be an independent director of an X so that is what is a simple example which I can give as far as this clause is concerned further qualification may be prescribed by Central Government.
So, this is another prescribed clause wherein Central Government retains the right to provide more stringent conditions or relax the conditions as far as the qualifications of independent directors are concerned .
Now, they should not hold together with his relative 2% or more of the total voting power of the company.
So, this relates to the voting power and then he must not be a chief executive director by whatever name called of any non-profit organisation that receives 25% or more of its receipts from the company.
So, they cannot be a chief executive or a director of a foundation which is opened by a company and they cannot be independent director of that.
So, this whole exercise which you can see whole pointers aims towards one thing that the person should be really independent.
Every independent director is required to give a declaration this is at the end.
Like: there are clauses does not only suffice at the end they have to give a declaration confirming independence at the first board meeting in every financial year or what whenever there is a change in circumstances like for example they have some relative who has an interest in the company.
They need to disclose this particular fact to the company and further schedule 4 of the Act contains a detailed code of conduct for independent directors.
Now, it took unusually long for this independent directors because it is a very important point as far as Companies Act is concerned and independent director's appointment, its qualifications, its duties are very important to keep a note off.
Moving to the other concepts which are there is a concept of interested director in section 182 sub clause 2 of a Companies Act and it says directors are in fiduciary capacity and are under a duty to disclose their interest.
Now, I will tell you that companies Amendment Bill 2016 has recommended for scrapping this particular definition because of its absolute nature because it does not there is no necessity.
It is used only two times in the act and that is why they say that this needs to be scrapped.
We will see what happens to that but again the concept as a concept interested director is already evident into the fiduciary duties of of a Now, first directors as the name suggests these are the directors who are appointed for the first time or you read section 7 of the Companies Act, which talks about memorandum of association.
So, whenever a company is born at that point of time there will be some people who are named as directors in the articles of the company and these are the first directors.
If they are not named in the articles of the company, the subscribers to the memorandum whose ever is name would be deemed to be the first directors until in the first General Meeting Directors are appointed , these are first directors.
There is a concept of resident directors which has been introduced under the Companies Act, 2013 and this is a very interesting and important concept wherein it says that every company which requires at least one director who has stayed in India for total period of not less than 182 days in the previous calendar year that is section 149(3) of Companies Act.
Idea for this is that there should not be companies are fly-by-night and they go away from our country without our knowledge and there should be somebody in India to catch hold off and that is where we talk about 182 days of Residence .
So, this concept is of resident director.
Then, there is a concept of Nominee director.
Now, Nominee director who represents the interest of the appointer point which may be any financial institution, any government or any other person, say for example representing lending Institutions or banks or small shareholder.
So, this appointment of a nominee director can be by way of a me a provision of law.
As it happens in case of small shareholders will see small shareholders.
We will see small shareholders directors in a short while or by way of any agreement.
It is good governance practice to have nominee directors and nominee director is appointed under section 161 subclass 3.
Now, small shareholders directors.
This is a new thing which has been introduced under Companies Act, 2013 and if we see this is a director who is elected by 1000 small shareholders or one tenth of the total number of such shareholders and represent; this is small shareholders.
Now, you people have a question that what is a small shareholder?Small shareholder has been defined and it means a shareholder shares of a nominal value of not more than 20,000 rupees or such other sum as may be prescribed and for this you need to refer to rule 7 of companies appointment and qualification of directors rules 2014 , so that talks about small shareholders directors.
Now, there is a concept of additional director.
Now, the name is additional director, so he is in addition to director and this type of director is basically appointed by the board of directors by virtue of power.
They have under articles of association at any time in between the year until the next General Meeting or last date on which the Annual General Meeting should have been held.
So basically, suppose the Annual General Meeting is held on January and sometime in September the required that there is a requirement of one more director or somebody has died in between, so they can appoint an additional director to meet the quorum and that will be an additional director until the next Annual General Meeting wherein he can be ratified as the director there.
But again, qualification is there, somebody cannot be appointed as additional director if he has been failed to be appointed as a General Director in a General Meeting previously .
So, he cannot be appointed by the back route by board of directors.
So, this is additional director there is a concept of alternate director.
Now, this alternate director as the name suggest is a type of director who is in alternate position of another director and this is happens in Companies Act only when there is a absence of that particular director for a period not less than 3 months from India.
So, if he is less than 3 months of India then he cannot be appointed and by that director and he is authorised by articles of association and by resolution passed by company in General Meeting.
So, appointment of dead alternate director is subject to some conditions and these conditions are he must not be holding any other alternate directorship.
He is not appointed as alternate to end independent director, so there cannot be an alternative to independent director because he has to be independent and he is qualified to be appointed as independent director under the provisions of the act.
So, for an alternate director all qualifications of an independent director applies but he is not a substitute to independent directors.
It seems quite interesting and he shall not hold office longer than the period permissible for the director whole position he is holding and he shall vacate the office if and when the director in whose place has been appointed returns back to India.
So, this is; what is the alternate director?Now, let us talk about women directors and this woman director is basically a new addition to the Companies Act, 2013 and they have introduced this clause wherein they say that the following categories of companies are required to appoint at least one woman director in their Board.
So, this is a very important clause and this contributes to a lot of things and division of women empowerment.
To summarise, we have talked about different terms of different types of directors and we have actually dealt with the different concepts; like: women directors, resident directors, non executive directors, executive directors and key managerial personnel, whole time director.
So, this gives us in understanding of different types of directors and these types of directors basically are acting in the company on different fronts and they are contributing towards the Corporate Governance and this is where we are in need of these different terminologies under companies act and that is what is different terminologies.
Thank you.

so as we know that Companies Act 2013 has streamlined certain provisions relating to the directors in the companies.
So what are the different types of directors? Who are the key managerial personnel of a company? So these things will be discussed.
Because we do not have any information as to given in the law that who are executive or non-executive directors, so will have a brief understanding about these two types of directors.
Then we'll go into the managing director, whole time directors, the managers of the company, what are their roles and responsibilities? We will also look into the other, a new terminology that has been used by the Companies Act; for example, Chief Executive Officer, CFO.

We had part one discussed in the last week where we discussed about the governance structure of companies, directors, their position, qualification, roles, appointment and also the different types of directors and key managerial personnel in the companies.
Continuing with this theme in this week also will have three modules, module number 19, 20 and 21 and module number 19 will deal with corporate governance in Indian companies.
We are very fascinated by the term corporate governance and everybody you can see that they are talking about corporate governance.
So we will try to understand what is corporate governance in Indian companies?Weâ€™ll have a brief history of the development of corporate governance and recently, not recently exactly in 2008 we had the case of Satyam also which again highlighted the issue of problems relating to corporate governance of Indian companies.
So in this module will discuss about the corporate governance in Indian companies.
The next module will be on corporate social responsibility.
Although it's not a new topic for us to be discussed in this course but since 2013 Act has brought a necessary condition on certain companies to have corporate social responsibility spending, so it's important for us to understand that what is this requirement, why there is a need for this requirement and how the company should have now a CSR policy for them? They have to form a committee for this purpose and they have to report to the shareholders about their CSR spending.
And if they are not able to spend why they were not able to spend that?
So that information be discussing in this module and will take certain examples of Indian companies.
The next module is very important which is related to promoters.
What is the role of promoters companies especially in Indian companies? What is their position? What are their rights and what are their liabilities? In Indian companies, the position of promoters is very important.
The role of promoters is very important because of the closely held companies or we can say, most of the companies they are families run businesses.
So in this case in such type of companies, what is the position of a promoter and what changes have been brought about by 2013 Companies Act we will have a look at that because in 2013 Act we had at the first-ever definition of promoters given by any companies act in India.
So weâ€™ll continue with this discussion and the next week, week 8 will be revision week for you, so I hope that you will continue reading throughout the week and in the next week you will refresh your knowledge through the revision.
Welcome to week 8 of MOOCs corporate law course.
As you know that this is a revision week so you don't have to read anything new but you have to simply revise whatever was discussed earlier in the last 7 weeks.
So if you remember in last seven weeks we have covered 21 modules where we started discussion with the type of Business and business organisations, corporate personality then we discussed about the different types of companies, their meetings, what other laws are applicable to companies and also we discussed how the companies raise their capital.
We discussed about the corporate management and governance also in two parts.
So lot of information about the companies has been already discussed with you and must have gone through the text as well as the video presentations and this is a revision week.
So that means that you should sincerely once again revise the portion that has already been discussed with you, relook at the videos, look at the assessment.
Do the assessment once again and certain assignment will also be given to you in this week.
Do the assignment religiously and work ahead course because this course will from the next week onwards will have more modules coming up so the work will keep on pilik on your shoulders.
So you should not waste time.
You revise and if you have any questions you can write to me on the discussion forum and certainly we will be in a position to take care of 21 modules in this week.
Welcome to week 9 after the revision 
I hope that you have refreshed your knowledge about the Companies Act.
So far whatever we had discussed in last 7 weeks and now in this week will discuss certain financial information about the company.
So this week will be about accounts of companies.
So we have two modules in this week, module number 22 and 23.
So module number 22 will deal with dividends and accounts of companies.
So we will discuss how the accounts of companies have to be prepared? How the financial statements have to be prepared? And if the company has to declare dividend what is the formality that the company has to comply with? What other regulatory features for that? All this will be discussed, then how many types of dividends can be declared by the company? What is the liability of a company when it declares dividend? How the depreciation has to be calculated? So these are few things which will discuss in the first module.
In the second module we will discuss about directors responsibility statement when directors or the board of the directors of the company they are laying reports before the financial statements before the company.
Now a lot of responsibility has been casted on directors when it comes to laying of financial statements.
So along with the financial statements and auditorâ€™s report there has to be now a directorâ€™s responsibility statement given.
Certain features have been added, for example, what are internal financial controls that the company has adopted? What is the risk management policy of the company? Everything has to be discussed.
So the advantage of this weekâ€™s module is modules is that that these modules are written by a professor who teaches into financial management institution only.
So you will hear from the person who deals with this on day-to -day basis and for being a law graduate it is important for you to to have some information which comes from the person who is dealing into the into practically with this statement.
So he has taken examples of the companies that how companies make these statements and how the accounts are prepared.
So I hopeful that you will learn a lot during this week and I will again meet you in the next week.
Welcome to week 10 of corporate law MOOCs course.
In the last week we discussed about accounts of companies and in this present week will discuss about audit of companies and there will be two modules in this week.
First module with audit of companies and second module will deal with auditors, their duties and liabilities.
Now laying of accounts before the shareholders is important work which has been assigned to the directors by the Companies Act that we discussed in the last module.
Now how these accounts have to be audited by the auditors that is also provided by the Companies Act.
So we will understand the concept of audit.
How audits is is done? What is the requirement of audit, why it is required to be , why accounts are required to be audited? And are there any special kinds of audits that are required to be done in any company? So these are the basic things that will discuss in the first module.
And this module is again written by the professor who teaches in the financial management institute, so I would request you to look into his content and also very carefully listen to his presentation to understand what a .
management professor has to say on the audit of companies.
And he has also taken examples from the companies.
The next module is on the auditors, so here we will look about the statutory provisions.
How the auditors are appointed? What are the qualifications? And we will also look into their responsibilities and liabilities which have been fixed on them by the Companies Act as well as we will also have a look on the common law principles which fix liabilities on auditors.
Now the topic of auditors has been since 2013 Act, a lot has been into discussion a lot because there was initial thought that Companies Act wants to done away auditorship but it is not case because we can understand that fixing the liability on auditors does not in any way diminishes their role in the companies.
So we will try to understand about audit and auditors of the companies in this module and I will meet you again in the next module.
Welcome to week 11 of MOOCs Corporate Law course and so far we have after the revision of discussed about accounts and audits of companies and the auditors.
Let us now discuss something other than that which is this week where we will discuss about business rescue proceedings and the compromises that can be done by companies.
Now, the question arises what is included in business rescue proceedings and the compromises? So, the terms which are used include arrangements, rearrangements, corporate mergers, amalgamations and then the concept of restructuring.
So, there are three modules in this week, again a lot of work for you.
So, module number 26, 27 and 28 and we will basically discuss about everything related to restructuring of companies in India.
So, we will understand these terms which are used in the Companies Act, look at the definition and also we will try to understand the concept of mergers and amalgamations in India.
In the next module, module number 27 we will basically discuss acquisition of shares and takeovers.
So, there is a basic difference between amalgamations, mergers and acquisition of shares and here we will also refer to SEBI regulations which are SAST regulations.
That is Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers regulations, so we will discuss the provisions of that and we will try to understand the difference between the different terms that we are using under the restructuring of companies in India.
Now, if we have seen that there are recently last five years especially there are so many mergers and amalgamations taking place in India and itâ€™s within the Indian companies as well as it is offshore mergers are also there.
Indian companies going offshore and buying stake into foreign companies.
So, what are these new cases? What is the trend and what are important developments in this area? All this will be discussed in the third module which will be on cases relating to mergers and acquisition.
So, you will see that in this week you will have a wholesome picture and understanding about mergers and amalgamations in India.
And we will, in the next week, we will discuss about the adjudicatory machinery in India.
So, read during this week and will meet next week again.
Welcome to week twelve of the MOOCs Corporate law course.
As and when we are progressing with the course you can understand that how much we have covered about the companies and their functioning.
So, continuing with that this particular week is about the investigation in adjudicatory machinery which is provided by the Companies Act, 2013.
Now, the question arises what is the need of such kind of machinery? We know that company has to meet its accounts.
So, how the accounts have to be inspected and how if there is something wrong with the affairs of the company, how the investigation will be done?Who will be the person responsible for carrying out the investigation and who will be the reporting authority for this purpose? So, we have three models in this week first module will deal with inspection and investigation of affairs of companies.
The second module is about the adjudicatory machinery which is a quasi-judicial system which has been given to us by the Companies Act.
In 1956 Act we had Company Law Board which is now done away with in the 2013 and we have now National Company Law Tribunal as well as National Company Law Appellate Tribunal.
So, initially it was difficult for the Companies Act to have inception or the constitution of these tribunals but now it has been done and there was the constitutional debate that was going on for the constitution of these tribunals has been cleared and now we have already incepted or constituted or established National Company Law Tribunal.
So, the cases which are pending before the Company Law Tribunal will be transferred to the National Company Law Tribunal.
So, we will understand the need for such kind of a tribunal.
Who will be the member and the chairperson of these tribunals and what will be the procedure to be followed when any complaint has to be given or the dispute has to be raised before these tribunals? And how the appeal will be sent to the National Company Law Tribunal? The last module on this week will be about the special courts and their establishment and as well as the Constitution and the powers and what will be the jurisdiction of these special courts? we are still waiting for the Inception of such courts but the Companies Act, 2013 has provided that there should be special courts which should streamline the dispute resolution as well as expedite the dispute resolution in the case of companies.
we are nearing the end course and I hope that you are keeping up the pace of the discussion that is going on.
Welcome to week 13 of MOOCs corporate law course.

Now, we come to the end where we are discussing about that what are the remedies to the shareholders and other stakeholders of the company? And how the companies can be wound up? So, we have, in this week 2 modules for you.
First first module will discuss about the remedies to the shareholders and creditors.
Now, the question arises what kind of remedies are required and why the remedies are required?So, for example, let's take a case that there has been operation of minority shareholders in the company or there has been mismanagement by the directors of the company.
So, what remedies shareholders will have in such a case Or if there are something wrong with the creditors of the rights of the creditors, then what remedies they will have?So, we will look into the provisions of the Companies Act, 2013 to look into the derivative actions or class-action suits or other types of remedies which are provided to the shareholders and other stakeholders in the company.
In the next module we will discuss about the winding up of the company that is how to bring an end to the life of the company.
How the companyâ€™s name can be removed from the register of companies and how it can be restored and what are the different types of winding up? What other grounds for winding up? Who can bring the suit for the winding up? Who can initiate the preceding? And if the company starts winding up what will be the distribution of assets?How the assets of the company will be distributed?So, all these provisions will be discussed in this module which will be covered under the week 13 and after this week only one week will be left.
So, I will meet you on week number fourteenth.
Welcome to the last week of the course on Corporate Law under the MOOCs course and this is week number 14 and we will be discussing about corporate insolvency and bankruptcy.
Now, the question arises why there is need to know about the corporate insolvency? When we read everything about the companies it is important for us to understand what is corporate insolvency and what are the laws that deal with corporate insolvency? So, we have two modules in this week.
First is on corporate insolvency, and second is on bankruptcy code of 2015.
So, we will have a brief outline about the history of corporate insolvency.
What were the earlier laws, and what is the recent position, now when a company goes insolvent? So, what is the procedure to be followed and what are the consequences of corporate insolvency? 
In the second module we will discuss about the bankruptcy code of 2015.
This is a new addition to the regal and regulatory framework of companies and this is treated to be as one of the landmark developments while doing business in India because now we have a code which deals with the bankruptcy, so people who come to India and the companies which come to India for doing business now they have a peace of mind that there is a method through which if something goes wrong with the company, they can handle under the bankruptcy code.
So, in this module we will discuss about the total outline of the bankruptcy code.
So, you see that now we have covered everything in this; the whole 14 weeks you have done the revision for initial weeks also.
And we have been participating in the discussion forum.
So, I think that now your knowledge about the subject is up to date
In the next week I will meet you for the revision.
