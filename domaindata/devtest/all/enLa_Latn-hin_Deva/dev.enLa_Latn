The earning source for these companies is through the income of dividend or interest which is earned by dealing in the securities or buying and selling of these securities.
One of the latest initiatives in the Indian context is the is towards setting ups these startups.
There has been a clarification provided by the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion wherein the notification provides that a startup entity can only be set up in the form of a private company or a partnership firm or a limited liability partnership.
Moreover, a startup can only be called as one for the first 5 years of its setting up or incorporation or till the time the turnover remains within the cap of Rs. 25 crores during five financial years.
This means that the startups can either be formed as a private company or a partnership firm or a limited liability partnership wherein under the various business forms that we have discussed a startup may choose from these smaller business setups to start functioning.
Summing up, in this module on types of companies we have covered the nature and kinds of these companies which are available of people who are desirous of setting up their business in the Indian scenario.
The benefits of choosing such business forms over the other available options, the procedural requirements for incorporating each of these business setups, and the changes which have been brought about by the Companies Act towards their regulation and certain new forms of business structures like associate companies, one person companies, dormant companies which have been introduced by this present new act.
moving ahead another important term that is called manager.
Manager is defined and it is very significant.
The definition if you read it says an individual, so it is a person, it is a individual who subject to the superintendence, control and direction of the board of directors has the management of the whole or substantially the whole of the affairs of the company and it is important to note.
Here, that what matters is not a person is described as a manager but what he is exercising substantial part of powers of a management.
It is very important to note here.
So, there are three important things which we noting that he must be an individual, it cannot be a company form or other things and he is subject to superintendence control and direction of the Board of Directors.
So, he cannot act independently on its own it has to be always under the superintendence, control and direction of the board of directors and thirdly that he has is the management of whole or substantially the whole of the affairs of the company.
With what does it mean? It means that he is the whole soul in charge.
A shop manager or a factory manager cannot be a manager under the act.
There is no need that manager must be an employee of the company.
So, there is no specific need but he must be an individual.
He must have substantially the whole management of the affairs of a company and must be acting on the superintendence, control and direction of the board.
Now it, I have already pointed out that it cannot be a firm a body corporate or association of person and here we refer to Section 196 of the Companies Act, 2013 and in as far as the manager's role is concerned I would direct you to read this particular decision.
It is pretty interesting decision CIT Kerala versus Alagappa Textiles AIR, 1980 Supreme Court 235.
That in fact this Supreme Court decision in detail discusses this concept of the manager and section 2(53) of the Companies Act, 2013 defines manager and that is what we have seen the definition and right now.
And 3 important points which must be considered as for the definition of Manager is concerned.
Now, let us come down to another term that is called Managing Director.
Now, this Managing Director is an important term and here we need to distinguish it with the manager and here if you see it says a director who is entrusted with substantial powers of management of the affairs of a company by virtue of what, by virtue of three things one either the same thing is mentioned in the articles of association of a company or by way of an agreement with the company or a resolution passed to this regard in a General Meeting by the Board of Directors or by its board of directors through authorisation to General Meetings.
So, they are the 3 modes by which a Director become a Managing Director.
But here it is important to know that the Managing Director is not acting under the supervision or control of board of director.
He is independent in this regard.
That is what we saw in case of manager he has to work under the superintendence, control and supervision of the board of directors.
Secondly, the Managing Director holds the position by virtue of being a director.
So, if he is not a director then he cannot be a managing director.
But, in case of manager it is not like that.
In case of manager he holds the position in his own right as an appoint appointed person as a manager and while Managing Director essentially has to be director before where as manager can continue to be a manager whether or not he holds the office of a director that is what is the distinction I made just now?Now, let us come down to the whole time director.
Now, section 2(94) of the Companies Act, 2013 defines whole time director and it says it includes a director in the whole time employment of a company and it may be noted that the director may be appointed as a chief executive officer, manager, company secretary or chief financial officer, if so provided in the articles of association of a company and would then be treated as the whole time director.
So basically, whole time director means a person or a director who is in the whole time employment of a company.
He has to devote full time or full time to the company and he can be designated, he can be appointed as Chief Executive Officer or Manager a Company Secretary or Chief Financial Officer.
So, this is what is about whole time director.
Now, there is a concept of Company Secretary and if we see the Company Secretary is defined.
If CS is appointed by a company to perform the functions of a Company Secretary under the Companies Act and every listed company and others having a paid up capital of 5 crores or more will have to appoint a Company Secretary.
That is what we have seen previously and though the secretary’s duties are largely of a ministerial or administrative nature.
We must be knowing about the company secretaries duty it plays a very important role in corporate governance.
Corporate governance basically you know that you have a proper accounting and accountability towards the shareholders and this company secretary defined in section 224 and this draws the definition from the company secretaries act and which means a person who is a member of the Institute of Company Secretaries of India.
So, he is a company secretary basically.
Then, there is a term called CFO that is Chief Financial Officer and these are very important term defined in section 219 of the Companies Act and if you see CFO means a person appointed as the Chief Financial Officer of a company.
So here, you can make a distinction between CFO and CEO.
In CEO we saw he is a designated person designated officer of a company where CFO is appointed as Chief Financial Officer of a company.
So, he is an officer who is appointed.
He is not just designated like CEO.
So, it basically says core management team.
What is core management team? This does not include board of directors because board of directors is excluding that is a policy making body of a company.
So, it comprises of all members of the management just one Level below to the executive director.
So, that is basically these are all functional heads who are there and who will be heading the functional units of or you can say SBU’s of the company and they will be dealing with the management, core management of the company.
So, these are the terminologies and this is what are important types of terminologies which we see? Now, let us come down to types of directors.
Now, section 149 of the Companies Act says company needs to have a board of directors.
Now which are they? The board of directors generally the composition of the board of directors includes executive and non executive directors; we will see what is the distinction between executive and non executive directors.
Now, the differentiation which stands between the executive and non executive directors is by way of corporate governance principles.
If you recollect the executive and non executive directors were not exactly defined under Companies Act.
They take their particular definition or this concept has an emergence from corporate governance principles wherein they say that the management of the company must have at least 50% of the board of members who are non executive means they are not part of the day –to-day activities or policy making of a company.
This was under clause 49 of listing agreement previously.
But now what has happened is, is listing agreement has now been replaced with SEBI regulations and this SEBI listing obligations and disclosure requirement actually talks about listing regulations.
And regulation 17 provides for the board of directors which mandates the similar thing that is 50% of the board must comprise of non-executive directors.
You would be aware about the number of directorship which company must have and minimum and maximum numbers.
So, as per the types of companies you know one person company there is one minimum director and maximum can be 15.
Similarly, for private company there must be minimum two directors and maximum 15 and for public company minimum is 3 directors and maximum can be 15 and in case of producer companies which is a interesting addition in the Companies Act, 2013.
Though not edition we can say this has been actually taken from 1956 Act and re-introduced into the 2013 Act exactly have must have a minimum of 5 directors and maximum of 15 directors.
Now, here these directorship can be increased more than 15 if they want but for that they have to pass a special resolution and by way of that only that it can be increased these are the types of directors which we are talking about.
Now, let us exactly talk about different terms which are used in context of types of director.
Now, let to begin with let us come down to executive and non executive directors.
I have talked about this a bit briefly in the previous slide.
Not let us talk about in detail it says the term executive director has been defined to mean a whole time director as per are the companies specification of definition detail rules 2014.
So, who is executive director? Executive director means a whole time director and who is the whole time director? We have seen the definition previously that he is a director who is in the whole time employment of a company.
So, basically executive directors in whole time employment of a company.
Now, the difference between the executive and non executive director lies in their being internal and external to the organisation and their involvement in day-to-day management of the company that is where I drew the distinction upon and as per the Kumar Mangalam Birla Committee report on Corporate Governance.
This was one of the important reports which laid down the foundations for corporate governance.
We see the executive directors like: Director Finance, Director Personnel are involved in day-to-day management of the companies.
The non executive directors bring external and wider perspective and Independence to the decision making and that is where we say the difference between executive and non executive directors of the board.
Always needs to be a Non Executive Director but again there is a composition thing here, if it is 50%, 50%, 50% are executive and 50% are non executive then chairman of the board needs to be a non executive.
What if it is two third compositions is executive, non executive and one third is non executive, executive.
Then, in that particular situation chairman can be a non executive.
So, it depends upon the composition.
Idea is that there should be ideal balance between the executive and non executive directors.
Independent directors.
Now this is a very significant definition and if you see section 149(6) of the Act talks about independent directors And Companies Act, 2013 has brought a very detailed proposition for independent directors and they have laid down their duties and responsibilities of independent directors which was not there in the previous Companies Act and that is why you can see the role of independent directors in scandals like: Satyam has been brought to for that independent directors did not act and there was no responsibility statement for these particular independent directors and that is why these changes have been made under the Companies Act 2013 and we see that an independent director has been exhaustively defined to mean a director other than the managing director or a whole time director or a nominee director.
So, these are not independent directors because they will have some stake or interest in the company.
For example Managing Director will be managing the affairs.
So, he cannot be independent.
Whole time director will be the employment of the company, so he cannot be independent.
Similarly nominee director will be representing the interests of the entity for which, which it is a nominee.
So it will not be independent, hence they cannot be independent directors.
An independent director in the opinion of the board is a person of integrity and possesses relevant expertise and experience.
Now, these are the two terms which are very important he must have, he should be a person of integrity, though objective because we cannot define what is integrity and possess relevant expertise and experience .
So, that is why there are lot of training happening on independent Directors, IOD portal, all those particular things do independent directors training .
Further he is a person who is or was not a promoter of a company or its holding subsidiary or associate company and he is also not related to promoters of directors in company, its holding subsidiary or associate company.
Moving ahead, independent directors must not have any pecuniary relationship.
On this, there is a big focus because it says that it must not have a pecuniary relationship with the company, its holding, subsidiary of associate company or their promoters or directors during the two immediate preceding financial years or during the current financial year.
So, he must not have a pecuniary interest because their stems the Independence.
If he is having a pecuniary interest then definitely he cannot be independent, then and also one of whose relatives has or had pecuniary relationship or transaction with the company, its holding and subsidiary, or their promoters or director.
So, relatives are also not allowed too.
Amounting to what is the pecuniary transaction? Pecuniary transaction is 2% or more of its gross turnover or total income or 50 lakh rupees or such higher amount as may be prescribed.
So, it can be less than 2% like for example that is not significant pecuniary relationship.
For example somebody has got a gift from a company like a small gift of rupees 5000 rupees.
Now, that cannot be 2% of the turnover or it cannot be 50 lakh rupees so that cannot be treated as independent directors.
So, it is said that, that is not a significant pecuniary relationship to influence the decision of a director.
There are ethical issues here.
But we are not going to discuss that here because that is something which is dealt with by secretarial standards and that is not the purport of this particular session.
We will discuss it sometime next and this is what is important? So, one is relationship.
It should be independent, integrity and pecuniary relationship should not be there.
moving ahead further an independent director neither himself not his relatives may hold or held the position of a key managerial personnel or has been in the employment of the company in the last three preceding financial year immediately preceding financial year in which he is proposed to be appointed.
Say for example: he is in 15-16 is the financial year.
In which independent director is proposed to be appointed.
Then proceeding three financial years that is your 14-15 , 13-14 and 12-13.
These are the three years in which he should not be engaged with a company as a key managerial personnel or as an employee.
Similarly, It he has not been an employer or proprietor of or a partner in any of the three financial years immediately preceding financial year.
In what in a form of auditor of Auditor or company secretaries in practice or cost auditors of the company or its holding subsidiary or associate or any legal or a consulting firm.
That has or had any transactions with the company its holding subsidiary or associate company amounting to 10% or more of a gross turnover of the such firms.
So, you can see where Independence is cast upon, and again a pecuniary relationship or a sustaining relationship.
So, suppose a company or a person who is head of that company secretary’s practice and he has been Company Secretary of a company ,he cannot be appointed as an independent director, because he has drawn pecuniary relationship from the company.
Similarly, if he is a legal or Consulting firm of that particular company, he cannot be independent director because he has drawn money from those particular company so that is why it is very important and the amount is also mentioned 10% or more of a gross turnover of such firm.
For example: if a firm has a legal firm, has a gross turnover of Rs.1 lakh rupees and he got around Rs 15,000 rupees from ex-company.
He cannot be an independent director of an X so that is what is a simple example which I can give as far as this clause is concerned further qualification may be prescribed by Central Government.
So, this is another prescribed clause wherein Central Government retains the right to provide more stringent conditions or relax the conditions as far as the qualifications of independent directors are concerned .
Now, they should not hold together with his relative 2% or more of the total voting power of the company.
So, this relates to the voting power and then he must not be a chief executive director by whatever name called of any non-profit organisation that receives 25% or more of its receipts from the company.
So, they cannot be a chief executive or a director of a foundation which is opened by a company and they cannot be independent director of that.
So, this whole exercise which you can see whole pointers aims towards one thing that the person should be really independent.
Every independent director is required to give a declaration this is at the end.
Like: there are clauses does not only suffice at the end they have to give a declaration confirming independence at the first board meeting in every financial year or what whenever there is a change in circumstances like for example they have some relative who has an interest in the company.
They need to disclose this particular fact to the company and further schedule 4 of the Act contains a detailed code of conduct for independent directors.
Now, it took unusually long for this independent directors because it is a very important point as far as Companies Act is concerned and independent director's appointment, its qualifications, its duties are very important to keep a note off.
Moving to the other concepts which are there is a concept of interested director in section 182 sub clause 2 of a Companies Act and it says directors are in fiduciary capacity and are under a duty to disclose their interest.
Now, I will tell you that companies Amendment Bill 2016 has recommended for scrapping this particular definition because of its absolute nature because it does not there is no necessity.
It is used only two times in the act and that is why they say that this needs to be scrapped.
We will see what happens to that but again the concept as a concept interested director is already evident into the fiduciary duties of of a Now, first directors as the name suggests these are the directors who are appointed for the first time or you read section 7 of the Companies Act, which talks about memorandum of association.
So, whenever a company is born at that point of time there will be some people who are named as directors in the articles of the company and these are the first directors.
If they are not named in the articles of the company, the subscribers to the memorandum whose ever is name would be deemed to be the first directors until in the first General Meeting Directors are appointed , these are first directors.
There is a concept of resident directors which has been introduced under the Companies Act, 2013 and this is a very interesting and important concept wherein it says that every company which requires at least one director who has stayed in India for total period of not less than 182 days in the previous calendar year that is section 149(3) of Companies Act.
Idea for this is that there should not be companies are fly-by-night and they go away from our country without our knowledge and there should be somebody in India to catch hold off and that is where we talk about 182 days of Residence .
So, this concept is of resident director.
Then, there is a concept of Nominee director.
Now, Nominee director who represents the interest of the appointer point which may be any financial institution, any government or any other person, say for example representing lending Institutions or banks or small shareholder.
So, this appointment of a nominee director can be by way of a me a provision of law.
As it happens in case of small shareholders will see small shareholders.
We will see small shareholders directors in a short while or by way of any agreement.
It is good governance practice to have nominee directors and nominee director is appointed under section 161 subclass 3.
Now, small shareholders directors.
This is a new thing which has been introduced under Companies Act, 2013 and if we see this is a director who is elected by 1000 small shareholders or one tenth of the total number of such shareholders and represent; this is small shareholders.
Now, you people have a question that what is a small shareholder?Small shareholder has been defined and it means a shareholder shares of a nominal value of not more than 20,000 rupees or such other sum as may be prescribed and for this you need to refer to rule 7 of companies appointment and qualification of directors rules 2014 , so that talks about small shareholders directors.
Now, there is a concept of additional director.
Now, the name is additional director, so he is in addition to director and this type of director is basically appointed by the board of directors by virtue of power.
They have under articles of association at any time in between the year until the next General Meeting or last date on which the Annual General Meeting should have been held.
So basically, suppose the Annual General Meeting is held on January and sometime in September the required that there is a requirement of one more director or somebody has died in between, so they can appoint an additional director to meet the quorum and that will be an additional director until the next Annual General Meeting wherein he can be ratified as the director there.
But again, qualification is there, somebody cannot be appointed as additional director if he has been failed to be appointed as a General Director in a General Meeting previously .
So, he cannot be appointed by the back route by board of directors.
So, this is additional director there is a concept of alternate director.
Now, this alternate director as the name suggest is a type of director who is in alternate position of another director and this is happens in Companies Act only when there is a absence of that particular director for a period not less than 3 months from India.
So, if he is less than 3 months of India then he cannot be appointed and by that director and he is authorised by articles of association and by resolution passed by company in General Meeting.
So, appointment of dead alternate director is subject to some conditions and these conditions are he must not be holding any other alternate directorship.
He is not appointed as alternate to end independent director, so there cannot be an alternative to independent director because he has to be independent and he is qualified to be appointed as independent director under the provisions of the act.
So, for an alternate director all qualifications of an independent director applies but he is not a substitute to independent directors.
It seems quite interesting and he shall not hold office longer than the period permissible for the director whole position he is holding and he shall vacate the office if and when the director in whose place has been appointed returns back to India.
So, this is; what is the alternate director?Now, let us talk about women directors and this woman director is basically a new addition to the Companies Act, 2013 and they have introduced this clause wherein they say that the following categories of companies are required to appoint at least one woman director in their Board.
So, this is a very important clause and this contributes to a lot of things and division of women empowerment.
To summarise, we have talked about different terms of different types of directors and we have actually dealt with the different concepts; like: women directors, resident directors, non executive directors, executive directors and key managerial personnel, whole time director.
So, this gives us in understanding of different types of directors and these types of directors basically are acting in the company on different fronts and they are contributing towards the Corporate Governance and this is where we are in need of these different terminologies under companies act and that is what is different terminologies.
Thank you.

Welcome to week 6 of a MOOCs corporate law course.
In this week we will cover something about the governance structure of companies and three modules will be covered.
The module number will be 16, 17 and 18 and module 16 will deal with the governance structure of companies so who are the stakeholders in the company? What is the role of the shareholders and other stakeholders? What is the difference between ownership and management of the company? How the Board of Directors, they get responsible for managing affairs of the company?So all this in brief will be discussed in the governance structure of the companies.
Second module will be on the directors, so what is the role and position of directors in the company? How they are appointed? What is their qualification? What kinds of powers are given to them by the Companies Act? And all other common law principles which are related to duties of directors these will be discussed.
The next module will be on types of directors
so as we know that Companies Act 2013 has streamlined certain provisions relating to the directors in the companies.
So what are the different types of directors? Who are the key managerial personnel of a company? So these things will be discussed.
Because we do not have any information as to given in the law that who are executive or non-executive directors, so will have a brief understanding about these two types of directors.
Then we'll go into the managing director, whole time directors, the managers of the company, what are their roles and responsibilities? We will also look into the other, a new terminology that has been used by the Companies Act; for example, Chief Executive Officer, CFO.
All these words, terminologies will also be discussed in this module.
And we will also discuss about the whether there are provision of shadow directors still exists under the Companies Act and who will be the, what will be the de jure or de facto appointment of directors.
Welcome to week 7 of Corporate Law MOOCs course and we will continue in this week with the topic of corporate management and governance that we started in the last week.
We had part one discussed in the last week where we discussed about the governance structure of companies, directors, their position, qualification, roles, appointment and also the different types of directors and key managerial personnel in the companies.
Continuing with this theme in this week also will have three modules, module number 19, 20 and 21 and module number 19 will deal with corporate governance in Indian companies.
We are very fascinated by the term corporate governance and everybody you can see that they are talking about corporate governance.
So we will try to understand what is corporate governance in Indian companies?We’ll have a brief history of the development of corporate governance and recently, not recently exactly in 2008 we had the case of Satyam also which again highlighted the issue of problems relating to corporate governance of Indian companies.
So in this module will discuss about the corporate governance in Indian companies.
The next module will be on corporate social responsibility.
Although it's not a new topic for us to be discussed in this course but since 2013 Act has brought a necessary condition on certain companies to have corporate social responsibility spending, so it's important for us to understand that what is this requirement, why there is a need for this requirement and how the company should have now a CSR policy for them? They have to form a committee for this purpose and they have to report to the shareholders about their CSR spending.
And if they are not able to spend why they were not able to spend that?
So that information be discussing in this module and will take certain examples of Indian companies.
The next module is very important which is related to promoters.
What is the role of promoters companies especially in Indian companies? What is their position? What are their rights and what are their liabilities? In Indian companies, the position of promoters is very important.
The role of promoters is very important because of the closely held companies or we can say, most of the companies they are families run businesses.
So in this case in such type of companies, what is the position of a promoter and what changes have been brought about by 2013 Companies Act we will have a look at that because in 2013 Act we had at the first-ever definition of promoters given by any companies act in India.
So we’ll continue with this discussion and the next week, week 8 will be revision week for you, so I hope that you will continue reading throughout the week and in the next week you will refresh your knowledge through the revision.
Welcome to week 8 of MOOCs corporate law course.
As you know that this is a revision week so you don't have to read anything new but you have to simply revise whatever was discussed earlier in the last 7 weeks.
So if you remember in last seven weeks we have covered 21 modules where we started discussion with the type of Business and business organisations, corporate personality then we discussed about the different types of companies, their meetings, what other laws are applicable to companies and also we discussed how the companies raise their capital.
We discussed about the corporate management and governance also in two parts.
So lot of information about the companies has been already discussed with you and must have gone through the text as well as the video presentations and this is a revision week.
So that means that you should sincerely once again revise the portion that has already been discussed with you, relook at the videos, look at the assessment.
Do the assessment once again and certain assignment will also be given to you in this week.
Do the assignment religiously and work ahead course because this course will from the next week onwards will have more modules coming up so the work will keep on pilik on your shoulders.
So you should not waste time.
You revise and if you have any questions you can write to me on the discussion forum and certainly we will be in a position to take care of 21 modules in this week.
Welcome to week 9 after the revision 
I hope that you have refreshed your knowledge about the Companies Act.
So far whatever we had discussed in last 7 weeks and now in this week will discuss certain financial information about the company.
So this week will be about accounts of companies.
So we have two modules in this week, module number 22 and 23.
So module number 22 will deal with dividends and accounts of companies.
So we will discuss how the accounts of companies have to be prepared? How the financial statements have to be prepared? And if the company has to declare dividend what is the formality that the company has to comply with? What other regulatory features for that? All this will be discussed, then how many types of dividends can be declared by the company? What is the liability of a company when it declares dividend? How the depreciation has to be calculated? So these are few things which will discuss in the first module.
In the second module we will discuss about directors responsibility statement when directors or the board of the directors of the company they are laying reports before the financial statements before the company.
Now a lot of responsibility has been casted on directors when it comes to laying of financial statements.
So along with the financial statements and auditor’s report there has to be now a director’s responsibility statement given.
Certain features have been added, for example, what are internal financial controls that the company has adopted? What is the risk management policy of the company? Everything has to be discussed.
So the advantage of this week’s module is modules is that that these modules are written by a professor who teaches into financial management institution only.
So you will hear from the person who deals with this on day-to -day basis and for being a law graduate it is important for you to to have some information which comes from the person who is dealing into the into practically with this statement.
So he has taken examples of the companies that how companies make these statements and how the accounts are prepared.
So I hopeful that you will learn a lot during this week and I will again meet you in the next week.
Welcome to week 10 of corporate law MOOCs course.
In the last week we discussed about accounts of companies and in this present week will discuss about audit of companies and there will be two modules in this week.
First module with audit of companies and second module will deal with auditors, their duties and liabilities.
Now laying of accounts before the shareholders is important work which has been assigned to the directors by the Companies Act that we discussed in the last module.
Now how these accounts have to be audited by the auditors that is also provided by the Companies Act.
So we will understand the concept of audit.
How audits is is done? What is the requirement of audit, why it is required to be , why accounts are required to be audited? And are there any special kinds of audits that are required to be done in any company? So these are the basic things that will discuss in the first module.
And this module is again written by the professor who teaches in the financial management institute, so I would request you to look into his content and also very carefully listen to his presentation to understand what a .
management professor has to say on the audit of companies.
And he has also taken examples from the companies.
The next module is on the auditors, so here we will look about the statutory provisions.
How the auditors are appointed? What are the qualifications? And we will also look into their responsibilities and liabilities which have been fixed on them by the Companies Act as well as we will also have a look on the common law principles which fix liabilities on auditors.
Now the topic of auditors has been since 2013 Act, a lot has been into discussion a lot because there was initial thought that Companies Act wants to done away auditorship but it is not case because we can understand that fixing the liability on auditors does not in any way diminishes their role in the companies.
So we will try to understand about audit and auditors of the companies in this module and I will meet you again in the next module.
Welcome to week 11 of MOOCs Corporate Law course and so far we have after the revision of discussed about accounts and audits of companies and the auditors.
Let us now discuss something other than that which is this week where we will discuss about business rescue proceedings and the compromises that can be done by companies.
Now, the question arises what is included in business rescue proceedings and the compromises? So, the terms which are used include arrangements, rearrangements, corporate mergers, amalgamations and then the concept of restructuring.
So, there are three modules in this week, again a lot of work for you.
So, module number 26, 27 and 28 and we will basically discuss about everything related to restructuring of companies in India.
So, we will understand these terms which are used in the Companies Act, look at the definition and also we will try to understand the concept of mergers and amalgamations in India.
In the next module, module number 27 we will basically discuss acquisition of shares and takeovers.
So, there is a basic difference between amalgamations, mergers and acquisition of shares and here we will also refer to SEBI regulations which are SAST regulations.
That is Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers regulations, so we will discuss the provisions of that and we will try to understand the difference between the different terms that we are using under the restructuring of companies in India.
Now, if we have seen that there are recently last five years especially there are so many mergers and amalgamations taking place in India and it’s within the Indian companies as well as it is offshore mergers are also there.
Indian companies going offshore and buying stake into foreign companies.
So, what are these new cases? What is the trend and what are important developments in this area? All this will be discussed in the third module which will be on cases relating to mergers and acquisition.
So, you will see that in this week you will have a wholesome picture and understanding about mergers and amalgamations in India.
And we will, in the next week, we will discuss about the adjudicatory machinery in India.
So, read during this week and will meet next week again.
Welcome to week twelve of the MOOCs Corporate law course.
As and when we are progressing with the course you can understand that how much we have covered about the companies and their functioning.
So, continuing with that this particular week is about the investigation in adjudicatory machinery which is provided by the Companies Act, 2013.
Now, the question arises what is the need of such kind of machinery? We know that company has to meet its accounts.
So, how the accounts have to be inspected and how if there is something wrong with the affairs of the company, how the investigation will be done?Who will be the person responsible for carrying out the investigation and who will be the reporting authority for this purpose? So, we have three models in this week first module will deal with inspection and investigation of affairs of companies.
The second module is about the adjudicatory machinery which is a quasi-judicial system which has been given to us by the Companies Act.
In 1956 Act we had Company Law Board which is now done away with in the 2013 and we have now National Company Law Tribunal as well as National Company Law Appellate Tribunal.
So, initially it was difficult for the Companies Act to have inception or the constitution of these tribunals but now it has been done and there was the constitutional debate that was going on for the constitution of these tribunals has been cleared and now we have already incepted or constituted or established National Company Law Tribunal.
So, the cases which are pending before the Company Law Tribunal will be transferred to the National Company Law Tribunal.
So, we will understand the need for such kind of a tribunal.
Who will be the member and the chairperson of these tribunals and what will be the procedure to be followed when any complaint has to be given or the dispute has to be raised before these tribunals? And how the appeal will be sent to the National Company Law Tribunal? The last module on this week will be about the special courts and their establishment and as well as the Constitution and the powers and what will be the jurisdiction of these special courts? we are still waiting for the Inception of such courts but the Companies Act, 2013 has provided that there should be special courts which should streamline the dispute resolution as well as expedite the dispute resolution in the case of companies.
we are nearing the end course and I hope that you are keeping up the pace of the discussion that is going on.
Welcome to week 13 of MOOCs corporate law course.
So far we have discussed lot of information we have taken lot of information about the companies.
Now, we come to the end where we are discussing about that what are the remedies to the shareholders and other stakeholders of the company? And how the companies can be wound up? So, we have, in this week 2 modules for you.
First first module will discuss about the remedies to the shareholders and creditors.
Now, the question arises what kind of remedies are required and why the remedies are required?So, for example, let's take a case that there has been operation of minority shareholders in the company or there has been mismanagement by the directors of the company.
So, what remedies shareholders will have in such a case Or if there are something wrong with the creditors of the rights of the creditors, then what remedies they will have?So, we will look into the provisions of the Companies Act, 2013 to look into the derivative actions or class-action suits or other types of remedies which are provided to the shareholders and other stakeholders in the company.
In the next module we will discuss about the winding up of the company that is how to bring an end to the life of the company.
How the company’s name can be removed from the register of companies and how it can be restored and what are the different types of winding up? What other grounds for winding up? Who can bring the suit for the winding up? Who can initiate the preceding? And if the company starts winding up what will be the distribution of assets?How the assets of the company will be distributed?So, all these provisions will be discussed in this module which will be covered under the week 13 and after this week only one week will be left.
So, I will meet you on week number fourteenth.
Welcome to the last week of the course on Corporate Law under the MOOCs course and this is week number 14 and we will be discussing about corporate insolvency and bankruptcy.
Now, the question arises why there is need to know about the corporate insolvency? When we read everything about the companies it is important for us to understand what is corporate insolvency and what are the laws that deal with corporate insolvency? So, we have two modules in this week.
First is on corporate insolvency, and second is on bankruptcy code of 2015.
So, we will have a brief outline about the history of corporate insolvency.
What were the earlier laws, and what is the recent position, now when a company goes insolvent? So, what is the procedure to be followed and what are the consequences of corporate insolvency? 
In the second module we will discuss about the bankruptcy code of 2015.
This is a new addition to the regal and regulatory framework of companies and this is treated to be as one of the landmark developments while doing business in India because now we have a code which deals with the bankruptcy, so people who come to India and the companies which come to India for doing business now they have a peace of mind that there is a method through which if something goes wrong with the company, they can handle under the bankruptcy code.
So, in this module we will discuss about the total outline of the bankruptcy code.
So, you see that now we have covered everything in this; the whole 14 weeks you have done the revision for initial weeks also.
And we have been participating in the discussion forum.
So, I think that now your knowledge about the subject is up to date
In the next week I will meet you for the revision.
So, welcome to week 15 which is a revision week and I can understand that you must be feeling a little relax that now fourteen weeks of too much of studies about the companies must have made you feel tired.
