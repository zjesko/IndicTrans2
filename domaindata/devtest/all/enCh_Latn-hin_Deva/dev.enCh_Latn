So , previously we have seen that under mild oxidizing conditions , either aldehyde group will be converted to the carboxyl group or it would be the primary alcohol group that can be converted to the hydroxyl group , but if you use a strong acid like nitric acid and add it to a solution of glucose , you will see that both the aldehyde as as well as the primary alcohol group are converted to carboxyl group and this gives rise to glucaric acid .
chromatography is a separation process using adsorption by distributing the component of a mixture between stationary phase and mobile phase .
plants transport water from roots to the leaves against gravity using this particular phenomena.
The recommended range of high density lipoprotein shows that the good recommended levels are one point five five millimole per litre and above .
These peaks that you obtained out of a mass spectrometer are then compared against a database which has about two hundred thousand to three , three hundred thousand molecules listed in it .
It means that the centrifugal force is directly proportional to the mass of the molecule , then it is the directly proportional to the square of the angular velocity and third is the radius , so the radius is also a an essential factor which decide that how the force , centrifugal force acts on the molecule .
Cerebrosides are the ones that have a single sugar residue like glucose or galactose .
Whereas , when you have a longer disaccharides like maltose , xylose or others disaccharides .
So , you won ’ t be able to recrystallize sugar like you can do for sodium chloride .
In first line what is written here ?
In both the types of chromatographic methods , the adsorbent that is used is silica gel which is polar .
This method is also same like the radioimmunoassay , enzyme immunoassay .
For example, ultraviolet electromagnetic radiation is not transferred with as much efficacy from one substance to another as thermal or electrical energy.
It also addresses the genetic bases of epigenetic changes an emerging area that promises to unite cancer genetics and epigenetics and might serve as a model for understanding the some interesting phenomenon like how cell type vary despite having the same D N A ?
The secondary structures which are connected by loops and turns to form a domain , as we know the secondary structures are elongated structures and only the elongated structures , longer structures cannot come together to form a globular domain .
