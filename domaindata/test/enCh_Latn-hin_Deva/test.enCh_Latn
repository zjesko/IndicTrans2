Each of these kinds of bonds is ascribed to some potential.
These potentials create the interactions which hold atoms together in molecules or crystals.
In many simple compounds, valence bond theory, the Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion model (VSEPR), and the concept of oxidation number can be used to explain molecular structure and composition.
An ionic bond is formed when a metal loses one or more of its electrons, becoming a positively charged cation, and the electrons are then gained by the non-metal atom, becoming a negatively charged anion.
The two oppositely charged ions attract one another, and the ionic bond is the electrostatic force of attraction between them.
For example, sodium (Na), a metal, loses one electron to become an Na+ cation while chlorine (Cl), a non-metal, gains this electron to become Cl−.
The ions are held together due to electrostatic attraction, and that compound sodium chloride (NaCl), or common table salt, is formed.
In a covalent bond, one or more pairs of valence electrons are shared by two atoms: the resulting electrically neutral group of bonded atoms is termed a molecule.
Atoms will share valence electrons in such a way as to create a noble gas electron configuration (eight electrons in their outermost shell) for each atom.
Atoms that tend to combine in such a way that they each have eight electrons in their valence shell are said to follow the octet rule.
However, some elements like hydrogen and lithium need only two electrons in their outermost shell to attain this stable configuration; these atoms are said to follow the duet rule, and in this way they are reaching the electron configuration of the noble gas helium, which has two electrons in its outer shell.
Similarly, theories from classical physics can be used to predict many ionic structures.
With more complicated compounds, such as metal complexes, valence bond theory is less applicable and alternative approaches, such as the molecular orbital theory, are generally used.

In the context of chemistry, energy is an attribute of a substance as a consequence of its atomic, molecular or aggregate structure.
Since a chemical transformation is accompanied by a change in one or more of these kinds of structures, it is invariably accompanied by an increase or decrease of energy of the substances involved.
Some energy is transferred between the surroundings and the reactants of the reaction in the form of heat or light; thus the products of a reaction may have more or less energy than the reactants.
A reaction is said to be exergonic if the final state is lower on the energy scale than the initial state; in the case of endergonic reactions the situation is the reverse.
A reaction is said to be exothermic if the reaction releases heat to the surroundings; in the case of endothermic reactions, the reaction absorbs heat from the surroundings.
Chemical reactions are invariably not possible unless the reactants surmount an energy barrier known as the activation energy.
The speed of a chemical reaction (at given temperature T) is related to the activation energy E, by the Boltzmann's population factor.
that is the probability of a molecule to have energy greater than or equal to E at the given temperature T.
This exponential dependence of a reaction rate on temperature is known as the Arrhenius equation.
The activation energy necessary for a chemical reaction to occur can be in the form of heat, light, electricity or mechanical force in the form of ultrasound.
A related concept free energy, which also incorporates entropy considerations, is a very useful means for predicting the feasibility of a reaction and determining the state of equilibrium of a chemical reaction, in chemical thermodynamics.
There exist only limited possible states of energy for electrons, atoms and molecules.
These are determined by the rules of quantum mechanics, which require quantization of energy of a bound system.
The atoms/molecules in a higher energy state are said to be excited.
The molecules/atoms of substance in an excited energy state are often much more reactive; that is, more amenable to chemical reactions.
The phase of a substance is invariably determined by its energy and the energy of its surroundings.
When the intermolecular forces of a substance are such that the energy of the surroundings is not sufficient to overcome them, it occurs in a more ordered phase like liquid or solid as is the case with water (H2O); a liquid at room temperature because its molecules are bound by hydrogen bonds.
Whereas hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a gas at room temperature and standard pressure, as its molecules are bound by weaker dipole-dipole interactions.
The transfer of energy from one chemical substance to another depends on the size of energy quanta emitted from one substance.
However, heat energy is often transferred more easily from almost any substance to another because the phonons responsible for vibrational and rotational energy levels in a substance have much less energy than photons invoked for the electronic energy transfer.
Thus, because vibrational and rotational energy levels are more closely spaced than electronic energy levels, heat is more easily transferred between substances relative to light or other forms of electronic energy.
For example, ultraviolet electromagnetic radiation is not transferred with as much efficacy from one substance to another as thermal or electrical energy.
The existence of characteristic energy levels for different chemical substances is useful for their identification by the analysis of spectral lines.
Different kinds of spectra are often used in chemical spectroscopy, e.g. IR, microwave, NMR, ESR, etc.
Spectroscopy is also used to identify the composition of remote objects – like stars and distant galaxies – by analyzing their radiation spectra.
The term chemical energy is often used to indicate the potential of a chemical substance to undergo a transformation through a chemical reaction or to transform other chemical substances.
When a chemical substance is transformed as a result of its interaction with another substance or with energy, a chemical reaction is said to have occurred.
A chemical reaction is therefore a concept related to the "reaction" of a substance when it comes in close contact with another, whether as a mixture or a solution; exposure to some form of energy, or both.
It results in some energy exchange between the constituents of the reaction as well as with the system environment, which may be designed vessels—often laboratory glassware.
Chemical reactions can result in the formation or dissociation of molecules, that is, molecules breaking apart to form two or more molecules or rearrangement of atoms within or across molecules.
Chemical reactions usually involve the making or breaking of chemical bonds.
Oxidation, reduction, dissociation, acid-base neutralization and molecular rearrangement are some of the commonly used kinds of chemical reactions.
A chemical reaction can be symbolically depicted through a chemical equation.
While in a non-nuclear chemical reaction the number and kind of atoms on both sides of the equation are equal, for a nuclear reaction this holds true only for the nuclear particles viz. protons and neutrons.
The sequence of steps in which the reorganization of chemical bonds may be taking place in the course of a chemical reaction is called its mechanism.
A chemical reaction can be envisioned to take place in a number of steps, each of which may have a different speed.

Ethanol precipitation is an important separation and purification process in the traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs) industry.
In the present study, a membrane dispersion micromixer was applied to achieve good mixing for the ethanol precipitation process of Astragali radix concentrate.
New experimental apparatus was set up to rapidly lower the temperature of ethanol solution before mixing with the concentrate.
Ethanol precipitation process was optimized according to Quality by design concept.
To identify critical material attributes (CMAs), ten batches of Astragali radix were used to prepare concentrates.
Calycosin-7-O-β-D-glucoside content, the sucrose content, and the electrical conductivity were found to be CMAs after the correlation analysis and stepwise regression modelling.
Definitive screening design was used to investigate the relationships among critical process parameters, CMAs, and process critical quality attributes (CQAs).
Quadratic models were developed and design space was calculated according to the probability of attaining process CQA standards.
A material quality control strategy was proposed.
High quality and low quality Astragali radix concentrates can be discriminated by the inequalities.
Low quality Astragali radix concentrates should not be released for ethanol precipitation process directly.
Verification experiment results indicated accurate models and reliable design space.
The temperature control method and control strategy are promising for ethanol precipitation process of other TCMs or foods.
in this work, a membrane dispersion micromixer was used for continuously adding ethanol solution to Astragali radix concentrates.
Temperature control was enhanced by rapid cooling.
Ethanol precipitation process was optimized according to a design space approach.
CMAs of Astragali radix extracts were identified.
Definitive screening design was used to investigate the relationships among CPPs, CMAs and CQAs.
The models were then developed and the design space was calculated.
A material quality control strategy considering the requirements of manufacturing processes was proposed.
Verification experiments were carried out for high quality Astragali radix concentrates.
Figure 1 is a schematic diagram of this work.
Ethanol solution at room temperature was cooled with a heat exchanger (K030-20M-NB4, Ningbo Gaori Technology Co., Ltd.).
The heat exchanger was connected to the refrigeration circulation device (CA-1116A, Tokyo Rikakikai, Co. Ltd.).
The heat transfer medium in the heat exchanger was 60% ethylene glycol–water (v/v).
The low-temperature ethanol solution was served as the dispersed phase pumped into the micromixer by a gear pump (CT3001F, Baoding Reef Fluid Technology Co., Ltd.).
A concentrate was pumped into the micromixer by an advection pump (2PB-20005II, Beijing Xingda Technology Development Co., Ltd.) as the continuous phase.
The outlet mixture was collected in a jacketed beaker and magnetically stirred for 5 min.
The temperature of the jacketed beaker was controlled by a thermostatic bath (THYD-1030W, Ningbo Tianheng instrument factory).
The medium in the thermostatic bath connected to the jacketed beaker is 30% glycerol–water (v/v).
The supernatant was collected after filtration.
After an experiment, the apparatus was washed with 0.05% (wt.) Na2CO3 solution and ethanol sequentially.
The low-temperature ethanol solution and a temperature-controlled jacketed beaker were used to control the temperature of the mixture together.
The use of low temperature ethanol solution could reduce the temperature of the mixture in a short time.
The temperature controlled jacketed beaker was used to control the temperature precisely.
The temperature ranges are shown in Table S1.
The imposing cliffs of Pointe de Hoc overlook the Normandy beaches where Allied troops landed on June 6 1944.
The assaults marked the beginning of the liberation of German-occupied Europe.
And the cliff tops were the perfect spot for artillery pieces capable of devastating any troops who tried to attack the Omaha and Utah beachheads.
The Allied command knew this and so, to shore up the attack, the navy bombarded Pointe de Hoc.
Afraid this might not be enough, they also had a backup plan.
A team of US Rangers scaled the 30-metre cliffs and, after locating the weaponry, deployed grenades, destroying the guns.
The key to success was the choice of thermite-based charges.
Yup, just good old iron oxide and aluminium.
Ok, so what this got to do with self-heating cans?
These were essentially a stove and can rolled into one, with a tube of cordite (more typically used as the propellant in small arms ammunition) running through the centre of the can to act as fuel.
The cans were quick and easy to use and could be lit with a cigarette, allowing troops to prepare a hot meal in under five minutes.
Unfortunately, they also had a tendency to explode, showering the assembled squaddies with piping hot soup.
Since then, there have been numerous attempts to make self-heating cans into a mainstream product.
Most relied on a rather less volatile reaction to provide the heat, although some have still struggled with explosive issues.
 Calcium oxide heats up rapidly when mixed with water.
But it’s not particularly efficient, producing about 60 calories of energy per gram of reactant.
The upshot is that, to heat the drink by 40℃, you need a heating element that takes up nearly half the packaging.
That’s just about OK if you want a small drink on a warm day, but in the depths of winter, when you might really want a hot drink, you only end up with a tepid coffee.
What’s needed is a much more efficient reaction.
Something, like thermite perhaps? 
As crazy as packing a can with a reaction capable of disabling an artillery gun may seem, that’s just what HeatGenie is planning.
Over the last ten years, the firm has filed numerous patents describing the use of thermite within self-heating cans.
It turns out the reaction used by the US Rangers is still too hot to handle, so they’ve dialled things back a bit by replacing the rust with a less reactive but no less familiar material, silicon dioxide.
So the latest generation of heated cans is fuelled on aluminium and ground-up glass.
When this reaction is triggered it still kicks out a whopping 200 calories per gram of reactant and can achieve 1,600℃.
Given the troubled history of self-heating packaging, releasing this much energy from the can in your hand might be a bit of a concern, so several of HeatGenie’s patents cover safety issues.
These include a complex arrangement of “firewalls” that can block the so-called “flamefront” should things get too hot, and energy-absorbing “heatsinks” to ensure the heat is efficiently transmitted around the drink, as well as vents to let off any steam.
With all that is place, the company claims just 10% of the packaging is taken up by the heating elements, which can still produce a warm coffee in two minutes (although the exact temperature hasn’t been revealed).
A US technology firm is hoping to make a very old idea finally work by launching self-heating drinks cans.
HeatGenie recently received US$6m to bring its can design to market in 2018, .
Yet the principles behind the technology go back much further – to 1897, when invented the first self-heating can.
So how do these cans work, why has no one has managed to make them a success, and what’s HeatGenie’s new approach? 
To answer that, we have to go back to World War II.
So, well over a century on fromRussian engineer Yevgeny Fedorov first attempts to make self-heating cans and more than 15 years after Nestle abandoned a similar idea, has HeatGenie final cracked it?
Judging from the patents and investments, the firm might have sorted out the technical side, but whether it really has a hot product on its hands is another thing entirely.
Happy Mole Day! 
It’s the 23rd of October and, at least where I am right now, it’s still between 6:02 am and 6:02 pm, so that means it’s time for chemists to celebrate! 
Of course, I’m in the U.K., so the date thing doesn’t quite work — for me this is 23/10, not 10/23 — but since there are only 12 months in a year (even in 2020) the British system is a bit unsatisfactory, so I’ll go with the American date format for the day.
There are literally loads of atoms in everything
What’s a mole? 
Well, to paraphrase Douglas Adams: atoms are small.
You just won’t believe how vastly, hugely, mind-bogglingly small they are.
I mean, you may think the latest incarnation of the walnut whip is small, but that’s just peanuts to atoms Or even walnuts.
There are literally loads and loads of atoms in everything.
There are so many of the blasted things that the numbers are a real pain to deal with.
A teaspoon of table sugar, for example, has about 7,400,000,000,000,000,000,000 sucrose molecules in it, and since each sucrose molecule contains 45 atoms, that’s a whopping 330,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 atoms.
And that’s not even a heaped teaspoon.
Even if we used standard form and wrote that last number as, for example, 3.3 x 1023 it’s a bit of a pain.
And chemists are far too busy to write things out in full — why do you think they came up with all these symbols in the first place? 
so what we do is we pick a convenient amount, which turns out to be 6.022 x 1023, and call that a “mole”.
It’s just like calling twelve eggs “a dozen” only, you know, bigger.
I’m not going to explain the origin of the actual number further than this.
There’s an awesome graphic here from Compound Interest and, if you want to know more, just click through.
What I am going to do are some… interesting mole calculations.
People usually do grains of sand or coins or something.
But those are so boooorrring.
It’s nearly Halloween, right? 
I say we go gruesome.
Let’s start with blood!
A healthy adult has about 35 trillion red blood cells in their body at any given moment.
(Vampires, presumably, have even more… although… do vampires make their own blood supply? Interesting question…).
35 trillion is a big number, right? 
A trillion is a million million (on the short scale, which everyone uses, don’t start), 1,000,000,000,000, or 1012, so 35 trillion is 3.5 x 1013.
But that’s only 0.000000000058 of a mole! 
Even if we count everyone on the planet, we only get to 0.45 of a mole.
Yes, that’s right.
Even if we drained the blood out of every, single human on the planet, we’d only about half a mole of red blood cells.
Ooh, how about bacteria? 
We have a lot of those on us, right? 
In fact, we have more microbes in and on our bodies than human cells! 
(Well, we can argue about the definition of “human” here, I suppose, but… let’s not.) 
Apparently there are around 3.8 x 1013 bacteria in our colons which means… damn.
This is the blood cells thing all over again, isn’t it? 
If we took all the humans on the planet, sucked out their gut bacteria (don’t ask) and collected it all together (really, don’t) we’d have, yes, a little under half a mole of microbes.
Don’t tell the tooth fairy’s boss.
She really IS scary.
Okay, this is all very well, but it’s not helping us get an idea of scale, is it? 
All right.
Let’s try human teeth.
Why not? 
I mugged the tooth fairy for this one (she’s much tougher than she looks), and it’s about 8 mm long.
Adult teeth are a bit larger, of course, but the fairy has less of those.
Let’s assume 1 cm to make things easier.
That’s 0.01 m.
If we had a mole of human teeth they would stack up to… 6.02 x 1021 metres, or 6.02 x 1018 km, or (we need to ramp this up a bit) about 640,000 light years.
That would reach a little dwarf galaxy in the constellation of Canes Venatici, somewhere in the general neighbourhood of the Milky Way.
Or, alternatively, to Neptune and back….
some 670 million times.
Gosh.
What about… hair? 
A fine human hair is about 0.05 mm across, which means a mole of (fine) hair would be 3.01 x 1019 metres thick.
The diameter of the Earth is 12,700,000 metres so that’s about… 2,400,000,000,000 times wider than the Earth.
Even Rapunzel might struggle with that much hair.
As I write this it’s the last day of September in the U.K.
, which means we’re well into meteorological autumn and summer is, at least here, a distant memory.
The weather is cooler and the days are getting shorter.
Soon, the clocks will go back an hour, and we’ll shift from BST (British Summer Time) to GMT (Greenwich Mean Time).
Seasons in the U.K. are particularly marked because of our northerly latitude.
British weather tends to be fairly mild (thanks, Gulf Stream), and it’s easy to forget just how far north we are – but a quick look at a globe makes it clear: London is actually further north than most of the major Canadian cities, while the Polar Bear Provincial Park in Ontario is roughly on the same latitude as Scotland’s capital city, Edinburgh.
Yes, I hear you say, but what on Earth (hoho) does this have to do with chemistry?
Well, a clever little piece of chemistry happens in human skin, and, if you live in the U.K., it’s about to stop.
At least, until next spring.
Some clever chemistry happens in human skin.
There’s a substance in your skin called 7-dehydrocholesterol (7-DHC).
It is, as the name suggests, something to do with cholesterol (which, despite its bad press, is an essential component of animal cell membranes).
In fact, 7-DHC is converted to cholesterol in the body, but it’s also converted to something else.
You will have heard of vitamin D.
It helps us to absorb calcium and other minerals, and if children, in particular, don’t get enough it can lead to rickets – which leads to weak bones, bowed legs and stunted growth.
Vitamin D deficiency has also been linked to lots of other health problems, including increased risk of certain cancers, heart disease, arthritis and even type one diabetes.
More recently, vitamin D has been linked to COVID-19.
It’s estimated that around 80-85% of people who contract COVID-19 experience mild or no symptoms, while the rest develop severe symptoms and, even if they recover, may suffer life-altering after-effects for many months.
Early data suggest that patients with low vitamin D levels are much more likely to experience those severe symptoms.
There’s a plausible mechanism for this: vitamin D helps to regulate the immune system and, in particular, helps to reduce the production of cytokines.
It’s possible that having inadequate levels of vitamin D may increase your chances of a severe response to COVID-19.
Cytokines are small proteins which are important in cell signalling, but if the body starts to produce too many in response to a virus it can cause something called a cytokine storm, which can lead to organ failure and death.
It’s proposed that having the right levels of vitamin D might help to prevent such cytokine storms, and therefore help to prevent a severe COVID-19 response.
This is all early stages, because everyone is still learning about COVID-19, and it may turn out to be correlation without causation, but so far it looks promising.
One thing you many not know is that vitamin D is, technically, misnamed.
Vitamins are, by definition, substances which are required in small quantities in the diet, because they can’t be synthesised in the body.
But vitamin D, which is actually a group of fat soluble molecules rather than a single substance, can be synthesised in the body, in our skin.
The most important two in the group are ergocalciferol (vitamin D2) and cholecalciferol (vitamin D3), sometimes known collectively as calciferol.
Shiitake mushrooms are a good source of vitamin D2.
Vitamin D2 is found in fungi, but it’s cleared more quickly from the body than D3, so needs to be consumed in some form daily.
Mushrooms are a good source (especially if they’ve been exposed to UV light), so if you like mushrooms, that’s one way to go.
Vitamin D3 is hard to obtain from diet – the only really good source is oily fish, although other foods are fortified – but that’s okay because, most of the time, we don’t need to eat it.
Which brings us back to 7-DHC.
It’s found in large quantities in the skin, although exactly how it gets there has been the subject of some debate.
It used to be thought it was formed from cholesterol via an enzymatic reaction in the intestine wall and then transported to the skin via the bloodstream.
But the trouble with this idea is that the blood would pass through the liver, and 7-DHC would be reconverted to cholesterol, never having a chance to build up in skin.
A more robust theory is it’s actually synthesised in the skin in the first place, particularly since higher levels are found in a layer closer to the surface (the stratum spinosum) than in the deeper dermis.
We make vitamin D in our skin when we’re exposed to UVB light from the sun.
Anyway, the important thing is that 7-DHC absorbs UV light, particularly wavelengths between 290 and 320 nm, that is, in the UVB range, sometimes called “intermediate” UV (in contrast with “soft” UVA, and “hard” UVC).
When exposed to UVB light, one of the rings in the 7-DHC molecule breaks apart, forming something known pre-D3, that then converts (isomerises) to vitamin D3 in a heat-sensitive process.
In short, we make vitamin D3 in our skin when we’re in the sunshine.
Obviously we need to avoid skin damage from UV light, but the process doesn’t take long: 10-15 minutes of midday sunlight three times a week, in the U.K. in the summer, is enough to keep our levels up.
Sun exposure is by far the quickest, and certainly the cheapest, way to get your vitamin D.
If you live somewhere where that’s possible.
Here’s the thing, though, if you live in the U.K., for a chunk of the year, it’s just not.
I’ve pinched the graph here from my husband, whose work involves solar panels, because it makes a nice visual point.
The amount of sunlight we’re exposed to in the U.K. drops sharply in autumn and winter.
From April – September, there’s plenty of energy available from sunlight.
But look at what happens from October – March.
The numbers drop drastically.
And here’s the thing: it turns out that vitamin D production in human skin only occurs when UV radiation exceeds a certain level.
Below this threshold? 
Well, no photocoversion takes place.
In short: if you live in the U.K. you can’t make vitamin D in your skin for a few months of the year.
And those few months are starting… round about now.
The NILU has a web page where you can calculate how much vitamin D you can synthesise in your skin on a given day.
If you want to experiment, there’s a website here, published by the Norwegian Institute for Air Research (NILU), where you can enter various parameters – month, longitude, cloudiness etc – and it will tell you how many hours during a given a day it’s possible to synthesise vitamin D in your skin.
Have a play and you’ll see that, for London, vitamin D synthesis drops off to zero somewhere around the end of November, and doesn’t restart until sometime after the 20th of January.
In Edinburgh, the difference is even more marked, running from the first week or so of November to the first week of February.
It’s important to realise that it tails off, too, so during the days either side of these periods there’s only a brief period during midday when you can synthesise vitamin D.
And all this assumes a cloudless sky which in this country… is unlikely.
The situation is worse still if you have darker skin because the skin pigment, melanin, absorbs UVB.
On the one hand, this is a good thing, since it protects skin cells from sun-related damage.
But it also reduces the ability to synthesise vitamin D.
In short, wimpy autumn and winter sunshine just isn’t going to cut it.
Likewise, to state the obvious, anyone who covers their skin (with clothing or sunblock), also won’t be able to synthesise vitamin D in their skin.
Fortunately, there’s a simple answer: supplements.
The evidence is fairly solid that vitamin D supplements increase blood serum levels as well as, if not better than, sunshine – which, for the reasons mentioned above, can be difficult to obtain consistently.
Now, as I’ve said many times before, I’m not a medical doctor.
However, I’m on fairly safe ground here, because Public Health England do actually recommend everyone take a vitamin D supplement from October to May.
That is, from now. Yes, now.
I do need to stress one point here: DO NOT OVERDO IT.
There always seems to be someone whose reasoning goes along the lines of, “if one tablet is good, then ten will be even better!” and, no. No.
Excessive doses of vitamin D can cause vomiting and digestive problems, and can lead to hypercalcemia which results in weakness, joint pain confusion and other unpleasant symptoms.
If you live in the U.K. you should be taking a vitamin D supplement from October-May.
Public Health England recommend everyone in the U.K. take 10 micrograms per day in autumn and winter.
Babies under one year should also be given 8.
5–10 micrograms of vitamin D in the form of vitamin drops, unless they’re drinking more than 500 ml of infant formula a day (because that’s already fortified).
Amounts can get a little confusing, because there are different ways to measure vitamin D doses, and in particular you may see IU, or “international units“.
However, if you buy a simple D3 supplement, like this one that I picked up at the supermarket, and follow the dose instructions on the label, you won’t go far wrong.
So, should you (and everyone else in your family) be taking a simple vitamin D supplement right around now? 
If you live in the U.K., or somewhere else very northerly, then yes.
Well, unless you’re really keen to eat mushrooms pretty much every day.
At worst, it won’t make much difference, and at best, well, there’s a chance it might help you to avoid a really unpleasant time with COVID-19, and that’s got to be a good thing.
But, look, it’s not toilet roll.
Don’t go and bulk buy vitamin D, for goodness sake.
When you mix bromine with another molecule that has a carbon-carbon double bond, the bromine can add across the double bond.
The bromine atoms are very heavy - about 80 times as heavy as a hydrogen atom, or 7 times as heavy as a carbon atom. Bromination usually gives you a molecule that has higher density than the parent molecule.
Vegetable oil - which has a density of about 0.9 grams per milliliter - can be made as dense as water (i.e., 1 gram per milliliter) by adding the right amount of bromine.
Brominated vegetable oil can give an emulsion in water that is opaque and visually pleasing - it turns up in all kinds of opaque sodas and sugar/sport drinks. 
Is it OK to ingest bromine? 
Just about everyone gets away with the small amount he takes in from the occasional soda, but it's definitely possible to ingest too much - awhile back, there was a case of a person who drank as much as a gallon a day of BVO-containing soda. Turns out, he got bromine poisoning!
edox-active transition metal complexes, those that can undergo multiple oxidation and reduction events, are ideal candidates for electrochemical energy storage and fuel technologies.
A significant caveat to employing these complexes for electrochemical processes is that their solubilities can drastically change across redox states, creating insoluble oxidation or reduction products that precipitate out of solution.
Even when the insoluble redox product is still chemically-intact (as in a reversible electrochemical reaction), it can often be difficult to electrochemically convert it back to its original, soluble redox state.
Researchers in the US have now come up with a new technique to overcome this, using ferrocene as a redox mediator to assist with electron-transfer between the insoluble materials and electrodes.
In addition to the experimental studies, the researchers also turned to mathematical modelling to gain more understanding of electrochemically-driven solubility cycling in electrochemical reactions. 
Two models were presented showing the effect of the deposited materials on the electrochemical response, either with or without possible electrode inhibition effects. 
Overall, the researchers have presented a unique strategy for improving the reversibility of redox reactions that are limited by insoluble redox products, which is beneficial for systems where both materials deposit on electrodes or are suspended in solution.
