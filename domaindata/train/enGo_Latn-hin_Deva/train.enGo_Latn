The length of roads which have two lanes (7 m . width) are – 7,261 Km .
The length of roads which have intermediate lane (5 . 5 m . width) are – 1,414 Km .
Thus, the percentage of two lane and multilane roads which was 62% in 2006 is now increased to 85% due to the earnest steps taken by this Government .
The remaining intermediate stretches will also be widened as two lane stretches in a phased manner .
Major District Roads
Next to the State Highways, the stretches which have traffic intensity are declared as Major District Roads by the State Government .
The Major District Roads connect production and marketing centres and these centres in turn are connected with the National Highways and State Highways .
In Tamil Nadu, the length of Major District Roads which was 7,569 Km . in 2006 is now increased to 11,288 Km .
In this, The length of roads which have more than two lanes (more than 7 m . width) are – 115 Km .
The length of roads which have two lanes (7 m . width) are – 3,109 Km .
The length of roads which have intermediate lane (5 . 5 m . width) are – 3,894 Km .
The length of roads which have single lane (3 . 75 m . width) are – 4,170 Km .
Thus, the percentage of intermediate / two lane roads which was 47% in 2006 is now increased to 63% due to the earnest steps taken by this Government .
The remaining single lane stretches will also be widened as intermediate lane stretches in a phased manner .
Other District Roads
In 2006, the length of Other District Roads (including Sugarcane Roads) was 42,748 Km .
Due to up-gradation of roads then and there by this Government, the length is reduced to 36,096 Km .
The Other District Roads connect Agricultural production centres and marketing centres with Taluk headquarters and other important roads nearby .
In this, The length of roads which have more than two lanes (more than 7 m . width) are – 31 Km .
The length of roads which have two lanes (7 m . width) are – 948 Km .
The length of roads which have intermediate lane (5 . 5 m . width) are – 2,292 Km .
The length of roads which have single lane (3 . 75 m . width) are 32,825 Km .

PENSION AND OTHER BENEFITS TO FREEDOM FIGHTERS AND EX-INA PERSONNEL
The Government of Tamil Nadu has always given top priority in extending facilities to the Freedom Fighters and their families, who had participated in the freedom struggle of our country .
The Government have introduced and are earnestly implementing a number of Welfare Schemes such as Freedom Fighters Pension, Family pension, Medical facilities, Free Transport facilities, priority in Government employment and allotment of houses effectively .
The Freedom Fighters Pension scheme was first implemented in the State with effect from 1 . 10 . 1966 .
As per the above scheme, Freedom Fighters who were sentenced to imprisonment or held under detention for not less than three months or who were killed in action or who became permanently incapacitated due to firing or lathi charge during their participation in the National Freedom Movement, are eligible to get Freedom Fighters Pension .
This scheme had been extended to the Ex-INA personnel and persons who participated in Naval Mutiny in 1946 and those who suffered imprisonment in Madurai Conspiracy case .
Further such of those Freedom Fighters, who have gone underground evading the arrest or those whose properties were confiscated / attached or who were terminated from service due to their participation in the freedom movement, were also brought under the eligibility criterion to receive Freedom Fighter Pension .
The period of three months of imprisonment that was fixed as one of the eligibility criteria for getting pension was reduced to three weeks with effect from 1 . 4 . 1980 .
The income ceiling originally fixed was also removed with effect from 11 . 3 . 1983 .
The Government have further liberalised the procedure for sanction of Freedom Fighters Pension .
For instance, instead of proof of imprisonment / jail records, a ‘Co-prisoner’ certificate obtained from the Legislators who served during the period 1980 or before was accepted as evidence for jail imprisonment with effect from 1 . 4 . 1980 .
Since some deficiencies in the above system were brought to the notice of the Government, the system of issuing co-prisoners certificate by the MLAs was modified during the year 1988 .
As per the orders dated 16 . 11 . 1988 issued by the Public (Political Pension) Department, an applicant may obtain co-prisoner's certificates from any two of the fifteen Freedom Fighters authorised to issue such co-prisoner's certificates throughout the State and apply for pension .
Further, the Government set up a District Level Screening Committee in each District as per the orders of the Public Department dated 7th February 1996, consisting of the Collector of the District as Chairman, the District Revenue Officer, as Vice-Chairman, three prominent freedom fighters as members .
The applicant, who makes a claim for getting freedom fighter pension, should have completed 18 years of age at the time of imprisonment and also should submit one co-prisoner certificate from any one of the authorised certifiers of the concerned district .
These cases are then examined by the District Level Screening Committee, as per the guidelines issued and are recommended to the Government by the District Collectors .
Thereafter, the Government passes orders sanctioning Pension to the eligible Freedom Fighters .
The pension payable to Freedom Fighters has been enhanced from time to time .
Keeping in view the centenary celebrations of Peraringar Anna and Freedom Fighter Kakkan, the Hon’ble Chief Minister announced in his Independence Day speech on 15 . 08 . 2009 the enhancement of Freedom Fighter’s Pension from Rs . 4,000/- to Rs . 5,000/- per month and family pension from Rs . 2,000/- to Rs . 2,500/-per month with effect from 01 . 09 . 2009 .
In the event of death of any State Freedom Fighter Pensioner, the pension is paid continuously to the wife/husband/minor children of the Freedom Fighter as family pension .
The Government also sanction the continuance of pension to the son/daughter of the freedom fighters who is suffering from any disorder or disability of mind or is physically crippled or disabled so as to render him or her unable to earn a living even after attaining the age of 18 years in the case of the son and 21 years in the case of the daughter till their life .
This family pension scale has been enhanced from time to time .
The details are indicated in Annexure II .
The Government have been sanctioning the special pension to the descendants of eminent persons in recognition of their significant role played by them in the freedom movement .
Under this scheme, the descendants of Sivagangai Marudhu Pandiar Brothers, direct descendants of Veerapandia Kattabomman and eligible descendants of Muthuramalinga Vijaya Raghunatha Sethupathy of Ramanathapuram are receiving pension at the rate of Rs . 500/- per month .
This Government has increased the special pension from Rs . 500/- to Rs . 1,000/- per month with effect from 1 . 12 . 2008 .
Now 132 descendants of Sivagangai Marudhu Pandiar Brothers, 7 direct descendants of Veerapandia Kattabomman and 76 eligible descendants of Muthuramalinga Vijaya Raghunatha Sethupathy of Ramanathapuram are receiving pension at the rate of Rs . 1,000/- p . m .

Based on the above discussions, action has been taken on many of the demands of the Associations and final orders have been issued .
Government Staff, Teachers’ and Pensioners’ Welfare
The Government have consistently felt the need for cordial relationship with the Government employees and Teachers since they play a very important role in the functioning of the Government and in carrying the schemes of the Government to general public .
The previous Government had withdrawn the benefits enjoyed by the Government employees and Teachers .
This Government, in addition to the restoration of those benefits, have also extended additional benefits such as - Repealing of TESMA 2003, filling up of vacancies, regularisation of strike period as duty, reducing of qualifying service for full pension from 33 years to 30 years, sanction of Pongal Bonus / Exgratia, sanction of 3 months’ salary as interim relief to all Government Servants including temporary staff and pensioners, payment of VI Pay Commission arrears in 3 equal instalments, increasing the quantum of festival advance from Rs . 1000 to Rs . 2000/- and enhancement of House Building Advance from Rs . 6 lakhs to Rs . 15 lakhs for non-All India Service Officers .
COMMITTEE ON APPEALS
The main source of disappointment for a Government employee arises when he feels that his grievances are not redressed by the authorities quickly .
The speedy disposal of the grievance would provide more faith on the Government by the Government employee .
Therefore, the Government considered that if an effective redressal mechanism on service matters is available, this would eliminate this irritant with the Government Employee and enable him to putforth his best in the duties assigned to him .
Hence, orders have been issued in G . O . (Ms) . No . 157, Personnel and Administrative Reforms (S) Department, dated 02 . 11 . 2009 constituting a Committee by name ‘Committee on Appeals’ with the following members to examine and advice on service matters on which application, appeal, review or revision lies with the Government except disciplinary cases:-

The “Committee on Appeals” shall meet once in a month, on the last Wednesday of the month and examine each petition and record its decision and send it to the departments concerned within a week after the meeting .
Based on the decision of the Committee on Appeals, the administrative department concerned will issue final orders, within 15 days as far as possible, after following the normal procedure of circulation .
ESTIMATE OF VACANCIES
The vacancies for all the posts in the State and Subordinate Services were estimated by the concerned appointing authorities / designated authorities prior to 2001 .
The estimation also included provision for leave vacancies and for unexpected contingencies .
In 2001, orders were issued modifying that estimation should be only for actual retirement vacancies and that there should not be any provision for leave and unexpected contingencies .
It was also ordered that all the estimates of vacancies whether for direct recruitment or for promotion should be cleared by Staff Committee .
Estimation to be cleared by the Staff Committee at the Government level caused unnecessary delay in the estimate of vacancy and preparation of panel .
Non-provision for leave reserve and unexpected contingencies posed problems in filling leave vacancies and unexpected vacancies during the panel year .
In order to obviate these difficulties, the Government issued orders in G . O . (Ms) . No . 123, Personnel and Administrative Reforms Department, dated 10 . 9 . 2009 whereby it was ordered that estimation of vacancies may be done as existed prior to 2001 .
By this, approval of Staff Committee is no longer required for the estimation of vacancy .
Only cases of direct recruitment above certain threshold limits the approval of Staff Committee is necessary .
This has eased the process of filling up promotional vacancies with suitable hands .
DELEGATION OF POWERS TO SECRETARIES OF ADMINISTRATIVE DEPARTMENTS

The Land tax had been levied based on the type of the Land and the crop yield .
At times, when the land tax was levied exorbitantly the scholars and the poets had played the advisory role by pointing out the defects to the King and had set the Government on the right path .
It is pertinent to note that even in the Sangam age, the poet Piciranthaiyar had given advice to the Pandia King Arivudai Nambi about the taxation system in his poem in 'Pura Nanuru' Cut the paddy corn When it is ripe, And make it into balls of rice, And the yield of a small field, Barely a fraction of a cent, Will feed an elephant For many a day But if the brute Should step into a field, And trampling eat, Even a hundred acres Will not serve, For the feet will spoil More than the mouth could eat . So, if a wise king Levies his taxes justly, His kingdom will yield him millions, And will greatly prosper as well .
An elephant can be fed for many days if the paddy grown even in a single 'Maa' of land (a fraction of an acre) is cut and balls of rice is made properly .
But if the elephant enters itself into the field, even if the Land is very large, then the paddy trampled by the elephant will be much more than the paddy actually consumed by the elephant .
Similarly, if a wise King collects tax from the people following the ethics of taxation then the nation will develop through accumulation of wealth in crore . "
But during the British Colonial Rule ethics of taxation was given up and the tax was increased upto half of the yield following the 'Half-net-principle' with the sole aim of increasing the revenue .
As a result Ryots were affected severely .
Subsequently, though the 'Ryotwari Settlement' was introduced by abolishing the system of tax collection through 'Zamindars' and 'Poligars' it did not ameliorate the burden of tax on Ryots .
With the establishment of the Democratic Government after Independence, a number of land reforms acts were enacted and various public welfare measures were introduced .
In the changed situtation, land tax came to be treated not as a source of revenue for the State, but as yet another documentary evidence of rights and ownership of the pattardars and users of the land .
The Tamil Nadu Government which is pioneer in the Country in implementing land reform measures and various public welfare measures, brought out a major reform last year in the land revenue assessment in the interest of farmers . The Government simplified the procedure and drastically reduced the land revenue for the wet land from Rs . 50 to Rs . 5 per acre and for dry land from Rs . 15 to Rs . 2 per acre and this nominal land revenue is being collected from the Fasli Year 1419, providing greater happiness to the farmers .
Thus with the passage of time, Revenue Department came to be treated not as a department earning Revenue for State but as a 'Public Administration' Department maintaining Law and Order at the District Level besides implementation of various important schemes and Land Administration and Land reform measures .
Further this Department acts as 'a friend in need' for the people by mitigating the sufferings of the people whenever they are affected by natural calamities like cyclone, heavy rains, flood, earth quake, drought, land slide and Tsunami .
In Revenue Department, at the State level, the works are monitored by the Heads of Departments (i . e . ,) Commissioner of Revenue Administration, Commissioner of Land Administration, Commissioner of Land Reforms and Commissioner of Survey and Settlement .
At the district level, under the leadership of the District Collector, revenue functions are discharged by various functionaries including District Revenue Officers, Revenue Divisional Officers, Tahsildars, Revenue Inspectors, Village Administrative Officers and other supporting staff .
By adopting Information Technology, Modern Management Techniques, Digitisation of Field Maps, Web based services, Touch Screen KIOSKS and Common Service Centres Revenue Department continues to serve the public effectively .

TAMIL DEVELOPMENT
POLICY NOTE 2010-2011
Paritimar kalaignar deliberating on the world classical languages observed as follows: Uyar moli is that which is superior in all respects to all other languages prevalent in and around its nation .
Examined in this light Tamil is superior to Telugu and all other Dravidian languages .
Since it is capable of functioning independently, Tamil is fit to be called tani moli .
Since it is an efficient and independent linguistic vehicle of a highly civilized society, Tamil could be a Cemmozhi .
Thus having all such credits, Tamil language is fit to be called Uyar Tani Cemmozhi .
Based on this natural merits of the Tamil language and owing to the incessant efforts of the Govt . of Tamilnadu the Indian Govt at the Centre have recognized the status of our language as a Classical Language of India .
Sangam literatures the classical Tamil literatures are not only an antique but also the unique representative of the cultural exposition of the Tamil society on the whole as well as the motivated artifacts of the experiences of the Tamils .
“26,350 lines from the Sangam compilations are enough to establish that the Tamil is the greatest classical language of the World” – Dr . Kamil Zvelebil

The aforesaid pattern of fostering has traces before sangam period, After the completion of the full growth of the Tamil as a classical one the ancient scholars also used the terminology Centhamizh for this language .
Sangam literature and Tolkappiyam are the unique examples of the aforesaid efforts of the Tamils .
The efforts exerted to provide a classical status could have been started from the time the Kannada language separated from the Tamil language .
The nasalization , construction, sentence pattern of the Tamil language are the fitting examples of the classical status .
The scientifically designed grammatical regulations of the Tamil language are languished by the linguists of today .
Guilbert Slater mentions that , it has attained the classical status and stood as a stumbling example of elucidating the exemplary character of the Dravidian civilization very long ago .
The Primary Classical Language of the World – authored by the great Paavaanar during the year 1966 discussed that the Tamil is the mother of all classical languages of the world .
Above all, Prof . Dr . George . L . Hart of California University defines as below:
The abundance of the words of the Tamil language, its’ subject depth, greatness, subtlety, profundity and the varied scope are unique for the Tamil Language only .
He explained further that among the primitive Indian Literatures prior to the modern literature it is the old Tamil literatures that dates back chronologically had its nucleus that speaks about the depressed and oppressed people of the society .
The universality of attracting the whole humanity by its doctrines lies in this language provide a helm of status to this classical language to treat this on par with other heritage classical languages of the word .

GREEN ENERGY DEVELOPMENT
Tamil Nadu is blessed with conducive natural metrological and topographical settings for wind energy generation .
Three passes namely, Palghat Pass, Shengottah Pass and Aralvoimozhi pass are endowed with heavy wind flows due to the tunneling effect during South West Monsoon .
The first wind farm of 1 . 165 MW capacity was erected at Mullaikadu in Tuticorin District, during 1986 in association with Tamil Nadu Energy Development Agency (TEDA) under the aid of Ministry of Non Conventional Energy Sources (MNES), Government of India .
Subsequently, various wind farms were erected by TNEB at other places in Kayathar, Muppandal and Puliankulam areas .
Similarly, during the year 1993, 8 Nos . of 250 KW Wind mills were erected at Kethanoor in Coimbatore District .
In all 120 wind mills were erected by TNEB in between 1986 and 1993 totalling to a capacity of 19 . 355 MW .
Based on successful functioning of these demonstration wind farms, coupled with conducive environment created by Government a number of private developers have set up wind farms .
Total capacity during 2008-09 has reached 4287 . 740 MW which has since increased to 4889 . 765 MW in 2009-10 .
The corresponding energy generated has also increased from 6655 . 150 MU during 2008-2009 to 8145 . 508 MU during 2009-2010 .
The installed capacity of wind generation in the state is 44 percent of the total national installed capacity and is ranked 1st in the country .
Solar energy:
The Government of India have recently announced “Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission” in the first phase of which , generation of 1000 MW of solar power has been proposed .
NTPC Vidyut Vyapar Nigam Ltd (NVVN) is to be the nodal agency for entering into power purchase Agreements (PPA) with Solar Power Developers to purchase solar power which will be bundled with the available unallocated Thermal Power of the Government of India & sold to State Power utilities .
NVVN will thus undertake the sale of the bundled power to the State Utilities at the rates determined as per CERC regulations .
When NVVN supplies bundled power to state utilities at the rates determined by CERC, those State utilities will be entitled to use the solar part of the bundled power for meeting their Renewable Purchase Obligations (RPO) under the Electricity Act, 2003 .
The CERC is to issue appropriate guidelines in this regard shortly .
Government of Tamil Nadu has requested the Union Government, Ministry of New & Renewable Energy, to make necessary arrangements for allocating 200-500 MW to Tamil Nadu out of 1000 MW proposed to be sanctioned in the first phase of National Solar Mission .
GROWTH OF GENERATING CAPACITY:
In the past 5 years the state witnessed high economic growth and appreciable improvement in the life style and living standards of its people .
The peak demand has already grown from 8209 MW during 2005-06 to 10180MW during 2009-10 .
Accordingly, the installed Generation Capacity excluding non-conventional power source also has increased from 10031 MW during 2005-06 to 10214 MW .
POWER POSITION:
The following table indicates the sector wise generation, total purchase and gross generation in the preceding five years .
PROJECTED DEMAND AND AVAILABILITY
The availability Vs Lighting peak demand and the deficit for the month of March 2010 to May 2010 are given below:
The deficit is proposed to be met by purchasing power from Private Power producers & also through power exchanges on a day to day basis .
Power scenario from June 2010 to May 2011
The availability Vs demand and the deficit during peak hours (18Hrs to 22 Hrs)
The deficit varies from 1400MW to 3400MW
The availability Vs demand and the deficit during Day time (6 . 00 to 18 . 00 Hrs)
The deficit varies from 1700MW to 3600 MW
The availability Vs demand and the deficit during Off-peak hours ( 22 . 00-6 . 00Hrs)
The deficit varies from 500MW to 2100 MW
REASONS FOR THE POWER SHORTAGE:
Reduced generation from Atomic power Stations at Kalpakkam & Kaiga and Neyveli expansion projects and delay in the commissioning of Kudankulam Atomic Power Plant are some of the chief reasons attributable to the power shortage during 2009-10 .
TNEB was thus forced to impose certain restrictive measures to limit the demand matching with the availability .
STEPS TAKEN TO MITIGATE THE POWER SHORTAGE:
DEMAND SIDE MANAGEMENT:
Considering the present scenario, some of the Restriction and Control Measures in vogue from 28 . 3 . 2010 are:
Demand and Energy cut of 30% for both High Tension Industrial and Commercial consumers .
Evening peak hour restrictions:
The High Tension industrial consumers draw power from the grid during evening peak hours (18 . 00 Hrs . to 22 . 00 Hrs . ) and utilise not more than 5% for lighting and security purposes .
For agriculture three phase supply given for 9 hours .
The agriculturists may operate their pump sets for 9 hours ie . , 6 hours during day time and 3 hours during night time .
Town and district headquarters feeders divided into 4 groups and supply interruption (load shedding) will be done not exceeding 3 hours in day time in rotation . (Except Chennai city and sub-urban areas)
Consequently rural area will be provided with supply for 21 Hours in a day .
The relief realized from the HT Industrial consumers not availing of power during peak hours from the grid except for their lighting and security purposes is considered as 1000 MW .
The relief realized with these R & C Measures during the day time (inclusive of load shedding) would be around 1600 MW . The relief realized with these R & C Measures during the off peak hours would be around 200 MW .
PRESENT POWER SUPPLY :-
The storage in Hydel reservoirs as on 31 . 03 . 10 was 883 . 716 MU as against 733 . 6 MU on the same day last year .
The available water thus is being utilized most judiciously to meet the summer and peak demands
To meet the deficit power is also being procured from the market to the tune of 2000 MW to 2500 MW .
Out of the above, 490 MW to 740 MW is being procured from the Captive Power Plants within the state .
TNEB is also procuring power depending upon the availability, through power exchanges on ‘day ahead’ basis .
Generators within Tamil Nadu are being allowed to sell power to HT consumers through intra- state open access .
Presently this is to the tune of 120 MW .
High Tension Industries also have been permitted to procure power both through inter-state and intra-state open access .
Depending upon the availability of power in the market, action is being taken to procure additional power to bridge the gaps whenever called for .
CAPACITY ADDITION
The projected demand as per 17th Electrical Power Survey for the years 2010-11, 2011-12, 2012- 13 is furnished below:
In order to meet the ever-increasing gap between demand and supply several capacity addition projects are being implemented/ have been proposed during coming years .

INDIA BASED NEUTRINO OBSERVATORY PROJECT:
India based Neutrino observatory (INO) project, a prestigious Scientific research project proposed at a cost of Rs . 900 crores is proposed to be located in Bodi West hills, Pottipuram village, Theni district .
Tamil Nadu was selected for this project because the rock in Tamil Nadu hills is of the best quality .
This project is funded by Dept . of Atomic Energy & Dept . of Science & Technology/Government of India and supported by 25 leading scientific research institutions in India .
The research is basically on “Neutrinos’, mass less particles and it is a pure Physics research .
As this fully air-conditioned massive research laboratory is to be located under-ground and is to be housed similar to TNEB’s under ground hydro-electric station at Pykara, approachable through a tunnel of 2 km length, and also as TNEB has executed 36 tunnels of about 105 Km length so far, the preparation of detailed project report on INO project was entrusted to TNEB on cost basis .
TNEB is the consultant and Nodal agency for this project formulation and facilitator in tying up all the requisite infrastructures for these underground laboratories and over ground residential quarters, office and guest house etc .
At any point of time, about 100 Scientists will work in the under ground laboratories .
Due to setting up of this ultra modern scientific research laboratory in Theni district and research centre subsequently, the scientific research in the colleges of Madurai and Theni district will get a boost .
ALLOTMENT OF CAPTIVE COAL MINES:
As of now, TNEB needs about 15 Million Tonnes of coal annually for generating power from its four thermal power stations with a total installed capacity of 2970 MW, out of which around 13 Million Tonnes of coal is being supplied by Government of India .
Therefore as advised by GoI to meet the shortfall in supply, about 2 Million tonnes of coal per annum is being imported .
In addition, as a permanent measure to meet the ever-existing shortfall in the supply of indigenous coal, it was felt necessary to go in for acquisition of captive coal mines .
Accordingly upon request made to GoI, TNEB has been allotted two coal blocks viz . , Gare pelma sector II coal block in the state of Chattisgarh alongwith the Maharastra State Mining Corporation and Mandakini B coal block in the state of Orissa alongwith Orissa, Assam & Megalaya State Mining Corporations .
Gare pelma sector II coal block:
A Joint venture company “ Mahatamil Collieries Ltd” (MTCL) has since been incorporated jointly by TNEB and Maharashtra State Mining Corporation Limited (MSMCL) for development of the Gare pelma sector II coal block in Chattisgarh State and also putting up a pit head power plant of about 2000 MW .
The total reserves of the block are about 768 Million tonnes wherein TNEB’s share is approximately 593 Million tonnes and MSMCL’s share is about 175 Million tonnes .
The Joint venture company has applied for the prospective license .
The prospective license has to be obtained for the area of allotted block to be explored .
The MTCL has entered into an Agreement with Minerals Exploration Corporation Limited (MECL) a Government of India public sector undertaking under the Ministry of Mines on 11 . 3 . 2010 for the work of detailed exploration of the Gare pelma sector II coal block and preparation of mining plan at a cost of Rs 37 . 10 crores .
TNEB’s share of coal from the mine will be around 10 Million tonnes per annum .
As the development of the mine is at the initial stage, production in the mine is likely to commence only from Dec 2014 .
Considering the huge expenditure in transportation and logistical issues involved in transportation of coal from the Gare pelma sector II coal block, it is proposed to install a pithead power generating station using the coal received from this mine .
The MTCL Board has decided to call for a tender for selection of Mining cum Developing Operator for the exploitation of coal as well as selecting a power developer for the utilization of TNEB’s share of coal from the Gare pelma sector II coal block .
Action is being taken in this regard and the notice inviting tender will be published shortly .

TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION IMPROVEMENTS
Some of the main objectives of improvements in Transmission & Distribution networks are :
To ensure quality power to consumers
To reduce Transmission & Distribution losses
To establish stable network for supply of power
To fully meet the load growth .
Under Transmission & Distribution network, 78 substations of various voltage categories and 1509 circuit Kms of Extra High Tension lines with an investment of Rs . 554 . 01crores have been added during 2009-10 .
The Transmission & Distribution losses in TNEB as a whole have been estimated at 18% during the year 2009-10 also, considering the units generated, units sold out and by computing the consumption of agricultural and hut services .
The aggregate Technical & Commercial (AT &C) losses in TNEB however have been estimated to be around 19 . 3 . % for the same period, considering the units generated, the units sold and the revenue realized .
TNEB has therefore proposed to undertake the following improvement measures to gradually reduce the Transmission & Distribution losses so as to achieve the targeted reduction in AT&C loss to below 15% by the end of XI Plan:-
To bring in improvements in the High Tension:Low Tension ratio by introducing high voltage distribution system with small capacity transformers
Erection of new substations and Extra High Tension link lines
Installation of Low Tension fixed capacitors, strengthening of distribution lines, replacing defective meters, etc . ,
FLAGSHIP PROGRAMMES:
Government of Tamil Nadu have been implementing the following Flagship programmes of the Government of India:-
RESTRUCTURED ACCELERATED POWER DEVELOPMENT AND REFORMS PROGRAMME (RAPDRP):
The focus of the programme shall be on reduction of Transmission losses and establishment of reliable and automated system for collection of base line data required for energy accounting using information technology
B: RAJIV GANDHI GRAMEEN VIDYUTIKARAN YOJANA (RGGVY) SCHEMES:
The focus of the scheme is 100% electrification of village and rural households .
RESTRUCTURED ACCELERATED POWER DEVELOPMENT AND REFORMS PROGRAMME (RAPDRP)
The Ministry of Power/GoI have launched the Restructured APDRP scheme under the 11th five year plan .
The objectives of the Restructured APDRP Scheme are to provide quality and reliable power supply to the consumers and to bring down the AT&C losses below 15% .
To achieve these objectives, MoP, GoI insist on a holistic -improvement of measuring systems on priority and to strengthen the distribution systems .
The project area will be the towns and cities with a population of more than 30,000 as per 2001 census . In addition, rural areas with heavy loads requiring feeder segregation could also be included in the project areas .
The project will be taken up in two parts where -PART– A will include the projects for establishment of baseline data and Information Technology applications for energy accounting /auditing and Information Technology based consumer service centres
PART- B will include regular distribution strengthening and improvement projects .
Ministry of power, Government of India have sanctioned Detailed Project Reports (DPRs) submitted by TNEB in respect of all the eligible 110 towns for an amount of Rs . 417 Crores and have also released an amount of Rs . 119 . 25 Crores as advance for implementing the scheme under PART- A .
Under the project initially the Government of India will provide 100 percent funds for Part-A and 25 % funds for Part-B projects .
The entire amount of loan and interest for Part-A projects will be converted into grant once the establishment of the required baseline data system has been achieved and verified by an independent agency appointed by Government of India .
During 2010-11, TNEB has proposed to avail the balance amount of the entire Rs . 417 . 00 Crores under part A of RAPDRP scheme for preparing the baseline data for the project areas covering consumer indexing, GIS mapping, metering of Distribution Transformers and feeders and Automatic Data Logging for all Distribution Transformers and feeders and Asset mapping in respect of all the 110 cities and towns qualifying under the project .
PART B: Ministry of Power has given certain definite guidelines for submission of Detailed Project Reports for Part B schemes and accordingly TNEB has submitted 22 DPRs out of which 10 DPRs have been sanctioned for an amount of Rs 103 . 91 crores and proposes to submit the remaining DPRs also by 31 . 5 . 2010 .
The Ministry of Power has released an amount of Rs . 15 . 59 crores as advance .
Under capacity building programme, training for the Class C and D staff of TNEB in the RAPDRP activities has already commenced on 27 . 1 . 2010 .
As per the scheme of things Power Finance Corporation will reimburse the entire training expenditure to TNEB .
On execution of the improvement works contemplated in the restructured APDRP schemes, the AT&C losses are expected to be reduced considerably in the project areas .
Implementation of IT enabled services under the scheme, is also likely to improve consumer satisfaction considerably .
RAJIV GANDHI GRAMEEN VIDYUTIKARAN YOJANA (RGGVY) SCHEMES
Towards achieving the goal of total electrification of households in the rural areas the Ministry of Power, Government of India have launched a scheme named RGGVY Scheme (Rajiv Gandhi Grameen Vidyutikaran Yojana) with the objective of creating Rural Electricity Infrastructure for completing the electrification of all the rural households by 2012 .
Sanction for schemes in respect of 26 districts of Tamil Nadu for an amount of Rs . 447 . 41 Crores in the first phase (out of the schemes posed for 29 districts) has been obtained from Government of India and implementation of the scheme is under process through turnkey contract awarded to M/s . TANSI .
The works envisaged under this scheme will cover installation of 11,284 Nos . 16/25 KVA Distribution Transformers and 45,911 KMs of HT & LT lines for providing access to electricity to all the 16,92,235 Nos . Rural households including 5,24,569 Nos that are Below Poverty Line (BPL) in the state, which presently do not have electricity connections .
This scheme once implemented will not only enhance the coverage of rural households to 95 . 28% but also substantially increase the per capita average annual consumption level to more than 1000 units which is the National goal to be achieved by the end of 11th Five year plan .
The scheme was formally launched on 10 . 02 . 2009 by the Hon’ble Minister for Electricity .
Due to the effecting of hut services and implementation of Colour TV Programme of the state government from the date of sending the proposals for sanction (2/2006) to the date of actual sanction (3/2008), the no . of un-electrified Below Poverty Line House Holds has however got reduced to 3 . 22 lakhs as against 5 . 24 lakhs sanctioned .
In view of the above reduction, the no . of Distribution transformers and lines to be installed also gets reduced to 10,538 Nos and 14,000 Kms respectively .
Out of 3 . 22 lakhs, about 2 . 17 lakh BPL service connections have already been effected upto 31 . 03 . 10 and it is planned to complete the entire remaining connections also by 31 . 5 . 2010 .

Revision of Tariff :
The Board has recently submitted a Tariff revision petition before the Tamil Nadu Electricity Regulatory Commission which is necessary to ensure its financial viability .
The current tariff proposal is a small step forward in the direction of correcting the tariff imbalances affecting the Board and making it at least partially financially viable .
While submitting the tariff revision petition utmost care has been taken to spare the agriculture and other needy and weaker section of the society from increase in tariff .
No tariff hike is proposed for Low Tension Domestic consumers consuming upto 200 units bi-monthly, hut dwellers, places of worship, Street lights & public water supply, Power loom weavers and Agriculture .
Similarly in the High Tension consumer side Places of worship, lift irrigation and the state of Pondicherry have been spared from the proposed tariff hike .
Very meagre tariff hike say 50 paise to one rupee/unit has been proposed for LT domestic consumers consuming more than 200 units bi-monthly (i . e . 201-400 units-- 50 paise, 401-600 units--75 paise, above 600 units -- Rs1 . 00)
The proposed tariff hike for defence, police and railway colonies by Rs . 1 . 50/unit, Cinema theatre, Cinema studios by Rs . 0 . 60/unit, private colleges by Rs . 1 . 60/unit, cottage & tiny industries for more than 1500 units bi-monthly by Rs . 0 . 40/unit, industries consuming more than 1500 units bi-monthly by Rs . 0 . 30/unit, Commercial service consuming more than 200 units bi-monthly by Rs . 0 . 70/unit and temporary supply by Rs . 3 . 50/unit .
Similarly in the High Tension consumer side, the proposed tariff hike in industries by Rs . 0 . 50/unit, Recognised Educational Institutions by Rs . 0 . 69/unit, Commercial establishments by Rs . 0 . 79/unit .
The proposed hike in tariff is very meager and reasonable which will offset only a part of deficit .
The Tamil Nadu Electricity Regulatory Commission has conducted public hearings on the tariff petition filed by TNEB, in Chennai (30 . 3 . 2010), Madurai (8 . 4 . 2010), Coimbatore (13 . 4 . 2010) and Tiruchy (15 . 4 . 2010) .
During this public hearing all the suggestions received from the public Association and other Industries etc . will be examined .
Then the Commission will take a suitable decision on the tariff hike as proposed by TNEB .

The installed capacity during the 10th Five year Plan (2002-07) and the three years under XI th Five year Plan are given below:-
During the year 2009-10, 8145 . 5 million units have been generated from wind which is 11 . 20% of Tamil Nadu’s grid consumption .
The TNERC has issued orders enhancing the rates from Rs . 2 . 90 to Rs . 3 . 39 per unit, effective from 1 . 04 . 2009 .
The wheeling and banking charges remain unchanged at 5% .
Wind resource assessment studies were carried out in 69 Wind prone Zones by setting up Wind monitoring stations since 1986, out of which 41 sites having annual mean wind speed of 18 KM per hour and above and annual mean Wind power density of 150/200 W/m2 and above at 30 m / 50 m level, have been declared by MNRE as potential and viable for commercial projects .
9 new wind monitoring stations have been installed through C-WET, a Govt . of India undertaking in various Districts with 20% cost sanctioned by the State Govt . and balance 80% cost provided by MNRE to C-WET .
They are under study with data being collected every month .
Wind mills can also be used directly for pumping water for drinking purposes or minor irrigation .
MNRE subsidy is available for installation of these systems .
BIOMASS POWER
The estimated power generation potential from surplus Biomass in Tamil Nadu is 487 MW as per the District level study carried out by Anna University with MNRE funding .
Another 600 MW is available from Bagasse based Co-generation in sugar mills including both private and public sector sugarmills .
The cumulative installed capacity of grid interactive biomass and bagasse based Co-generation is 696 . 95 MW as on 31 . 3 . 2010 (559 . 90 MW from Bagasse Co-generation 137 . 05 MW from Biomass Power including waste to energy projects) . In the case of Co-generation projects, the total exportable surplus power, after their own consumption, is around 330 MW .
During 2009-10, 4 private sugar mills had commissioned co-generation plant to a capacity of 93 . 8 MW .
In the meanwhile TNEB is taking all efforts to establish co-gen plants in 14 Co-operative and public sector sugar mills in Tamil Nadu, by arranging for funds through Power Finance Corporation (PFC), including modernizing the plant . The total capacity of such projects is around 213 MW .
In respect of biomass based power projects during 2009-10, 3 projects to a capacity of 27 . 5 MW have been added one each in Virudhunagar, Tiruvannamalai and Krishnagiri District .
Originally the total installed capacity of biomass power project was 141 . 7 MW in the State .
Out of which, two projects viz . one in Ramnad District (18 MW) and one in Thoothukudi District (20MW) have opted for 100% coal, instead of Biomass and had already cancelled the PPA executed with TNEB .
Therefore the total No . of projects under Biomass power category is 14, with a capacity of 131 . 20 MW including three No . projects commissioned during this year .
MNRE had sanctioned 90 lakhs during the year 2009-10 as Central Financial Assistance towards establishment of 500 KW Biomass gasifier with 100% producer gas engine, to be connected to Grid . The project is being implemented by M/s . Sri Sastha Energy Private Limited, Arcot Taluk, Vellore District and first instalment of Rs . 63 lakhs was released .
