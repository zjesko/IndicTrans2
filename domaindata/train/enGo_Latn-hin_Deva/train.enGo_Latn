It is pertinent to note that even in the Sangam age, the poet Piciranthaiyar had given advice to the Pandia King Arivudai Nambi about the taxation system in his poem in 'Pura Nanuru' Cut the paddy corn When it is ripe, And make it into balls of rice, And the yield of a small field, Barely a fraction of a cent, Will feed an elephant For many a day But if the brute Should step into a field, And trampling eat, Even a hundred acres Will not serve, For the feet will spoil More than the mouth could eat . So, if a wise king Levies his taxes justly, His kingdom will yield him millions, And will greatly prosper as well .
