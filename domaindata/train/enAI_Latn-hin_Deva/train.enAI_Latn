Let us look at what let us summarize what we have we have looked at in this module before we embark on the next module.
So in case number one, now it once it is backed up the next slide looks shows that.
And once again we get 5,0,3 which is already explored before.
The player starts from some state ok Here in this state, it has B,C,D, E and further and further when we stop, whatever those leaf node values are, static evaluation function is applied and calculated.
Toh , the summation suppose if I want to calculate noise the sum that is happening at H one how it is calculated is shown in the next slide.
Here, we will be talking about progression, regression and few other things.
You may you may ask why the function is called objective rather than heuristic?
But then two important principals which I have already to talked about let me reiterate them.
So, that is basically summation and how HI values are calculated, we have already seen that.
If it is phi means that you have deleted something which is not part of the goal state then it is absolutely fine.
Okay And you have output units.
Thank you!
They are able to do it.
Some presentations are complex compared with others.
Okay , so that essence is not captured by the language, it's not the limitation of CD , the CD is actually derived from that language.
But many people believe that it is GA is not part of AI , it is part of soft computing.
Object bat.
okay , the genetic footprint of anybody is called a genome.
Generate new state by applying next rule, no rules left.
We look at the Tic Tac Toe position and decide whether it is win loss or draw okay .
Is almost a replica of the previous rule.
So the preconditions that you use should use M equal to zero.
We’ll jump to ten and we got a solution, Okay .
The chromosome contains genetic map of individual in form of a DNAs, okay .
What we want is to have the problem in the final state once we completely solve that problem.
Think of it.
The subscripts that we are using here, one one to n, okay .
First, not all rules are used.
3,5,0 can be converted to 0,5,3.
We will be seeing this EAST model in action along with text recognition.
Now how have I decided those fifty images?
Artificial intelligence (AI), is intelligence demonstrated by machines, unlike the natural intelligence displayed by humans and animals.
Okay .
For example, if you use a heuristic function called H which for a better move gives a higher value of heuristic function.
So, so it could do it because the chess playing programs use heuristics based on the way the Garry Kasparov used to play chess.
One is called layer.
The the actual case all spaces, suppose for example you have twenty solutions,
the rule is return in a very simple programming like way.
So there are two options W and L.
Okay .
Simplicity is is the other issue.
So, to code program robots, one needs to use this kind of logic.
So, there's no point exploring it and the other reason is that, I have minus three already see I'm a player, I have B and C.
Thus the discussion becomes a little more complex but the same, okay .
M plus L, two plus one, three, zero plus three, three.
In our case we are represented in a semi CD form where where you are only using that ACT and nothing else here.
In fact, it it it allows you to pick up the best child, not only that irrespective of the parents value.
The problem with this method is that it is pretty expensive in terms of memory.
In in We have seen two cases in one case we have looked at missionary cannibal problem the other case we have looked at farmer, fox, chicken grain problem.
So that is false.
But, empirically it is proved that in most cases you get them.
So once you get the right tour, the job is done.
What will happen is there are two paths available now.
And it it it get the values on in the slots the attributes and and it can reason.
One more thing that might come to your mind that is it possible for you to represent the same statement in two different ways?
In fact, I have avoided using O Milkha Singh object okay and that that relationship I have not written here to indicate that sometimes you can even omit that.
And you can also see that this is a complete network, every input unit is connected to every middle unit and every middle unit or hidden layer unit is connected to every output unit.
So we are not going to explore that further, Okay .
Back For back propagation algorithm what you need is a multi-layer neuron.
Now, every entity involved in a statement has some role to play and this role is represented by this conceptual role that we talk about.
The other thing is also there, I've I’ve used my own order.
Progression is about moving further in the state space towards the goal.
So, the normal generate and test is applied only when the classification is done.
So, that is something which is there, but you can see that additionally with a friend.
In 2005, it was open-sourced by HP.
So, what do you want to do is you just have to achieve B on top of A and A is on top of table, that's what we want only two things to be done.
So, that is what it is doing and researchers are looking at nature for inspiration and there are many examples like ant colony optimization, and what they learned how ants find shortest path to their food source, they devise algorithm capable of working with small components like ants, they call agents, and which is very, very low intelligent intelligence level agent with less memory, less power.
Okay , Why?
If the array is empty then report failure.
But those are all things which are part of the representation.
We’ll start all over again.
So, L is this and R is exactly opposite to this and that is very important.
Now, the earlier Ravan was dead because Ram did that.
Thank you.
Chatbots answer users’ questions and help them handle simple tasks without the help of a human.
But remember if this exploration one of the parameter of exploration is the criticality of the game.
So, the next slide talks about this process in a little more detail.
But that may not be true if M one is zero.
So, that's the reason why documentation is very critical.
How will you do that?
It says that Ravan is dead because the reason for that is Ram Ram has done something to him okay or poisoned him. Whatever.
But then there is a problem.
So, if you have six units you can have total sixty four possible output.
Not only leave-alone expert system, every system requires that.
That also assume one more thing that I was hungry, Okay .
Thank you!
For example, when I worked with one of my student on intrusion detection system, both of us learn a lot of things out of it.
It’s a default interaction that is triggered when the bot doesn’t recognize the user’s input.
And, whenever it is it is possible when the goals are interdependent, suppose you want to solve a problem which un-solves some other problem. If that happens you just test and if it is the case the which is unsolved is again inserted in the goal stack and again solved.
No, no, no, this is not what we wanted. Even in that case, you get a very, very strong feedback on what is not wanted.
It’s shown right above the minimized chat widget.
What does that mean?
You’re paying you probably have dined, Okay .
There's no difference just named as objective function.
First , if you learn about Unguided Search Methods, you can always improve them by providing heuristics.
So, that can generalize.
How can a computer program do it?
The encoder’s inputs first flow through a self-attention layer – a layer that helps the encoder look at other words in the input sentence as it encodes a specific word. 
Progress slowed and in 1974, in response to the criticism of Sir James Lighthill and ongoing pressure from the US Congress to fund more productive projects, both the U.S. and British governments cut off exploratory research in AI.
And it's good.
If missionaries are two, cannibal is zero.
Look at the next slide that.
Here, the artificial limit is pretty simple 3.
So, classification can be only one, correct classification, right image, friend’s image is friend’s, non-friend’s is non-friend, great .
We are going to address a simpler problem of how one can represent using a state space.
Now again , we’ll try to explore the left child which is 6,0,2, which again runs into trouble.
How it is done, we’ll see later.
Now, you can see that.
The hidden layer number of units people have worked on and decided that the best value for hidden unit number of hidden units, can be calculated by using geometric mean of input number of input units and number of hidden the output units.
So, that is it.
In such a case, padding the bounding box could help.
Obviously they’re needed.
What are the deletions?
You can ask for the color of the tail of the cat or ask for the hat the tennis player is wearing and the the computer program looking at the image can answer you.
And reproduction process helps the genes to carry from parent to offspring, okay .
I We have named it as Unguided Search Methods.
Now the earlier module we described both methods which are they are they are quite common and they are quite general in the sense that many variants of them exist in in in the real world.
okay , Many a times expert will not be able to tell the KE that I'm I’m solving this problem this way.
So, that's what we are learning right now.
All of them will start using path one and you can see that when they find path one, again it is the optimized path.
It invariably finds the shortest path. That's the first thing.
So, this is represented this way.
That is exactly what's happening here and it is in PPT is it is bold-faced.
That's what the state space representation.
And we have to use valid moves as I said.
Okay the beginning you you you just insert all nodes in an array and other unexplored node in the other array and find out the best node from the array.
Does your company have a lot of internal documentation that needs to be translated into other languages? 
Now now you can see that that part is also quite simple compared to the previous rule this is more readable actually.
I am moving three gallons of milk from eight gallon water jug into the three gallon water jug. And 3,2,3 moving three gallons of milk from five gallon jug into the three gallon jug.
So I'm not going to play C.
Expert learns about his own role.
So, in the beginning we'll we’ll we'll look at the 0,5,3 then 3,5,0 is right child and then 8,0,0 is right child. Okay . That is precisely what we’re doing.
So, that is also talked about later in the slide that delta T plus one tau T plus one is basically I equal to one to N delta tau T plus one I, which is a contribution from Ith ant.
So I I looked at both innings, I'm happy if my team has won, I'm not happy if my team has lost and so on so forth.
For example, let us again take chess.
We have seen that it is complex to write rules.
Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN) is a combination of CNN, RNN, and CTC(Connectionist Temporal Classification) loss for image-based sequence recognition tasks, such as scene text recognition and OCR.
If my current node’s heuristic value is three, I get a node with with heuristic value five I I just move.
Control strategy decides which rule to apply next.
But then it says ‘with a stick.’ Now, how do you represent that part ‘with a stick?’
That is the meaning.
A human brain can easily do it, can deal with this incomplete fuzzy things and so and so forth, but conventional computer programs couldn’t do it.
Okay , so sometimes some authors combine few rules together, sometimes some authors even use a general rule which which actually represent multiple rules together and so on so forth. So, you won't find the matching.
They they contain forty six chromosomes and that is twenty three pairs of chromosomes found in the nucleus of each cell, okay , the forty six chromosomes are found.
I try one more .
This also is not very good, Okay .
Are they same?
Now there are some pheromone values available.
In sigmoid, will continuously increase because if you want to get one actually, it is sigmoid will output value between zero and one.
okay so That also is indicator and that indicator is important for us here because at alternate layers, we are picking up either maximum or minimum values.
The explanation is is very critical here.
See the prerequisites there are four prerequisites in this state space representation.
The structure is not only dynamic, the structure is also completely distributed, every neuron takes a decision on its own.
We pick up six which is best, Okay , this is what we’re doing.
As per wikipedia-
We have already looked at genetic algorithms.
Eventually, from this previous state you will go to this goal state so our actual working is on this direction.
When the representation is confined to the very statement, now script, actually help us improve that and there is one more example which I gave in the the handout that I went to Indroda Park, which is a natural zoo in Gandhinagar with kids you assume that a lot of other things like I bought tickets, I I took my car inside and I parked my car in the in the parking zone, I took all picnic related material from my car, went inside, enjoyed watching animals and had my breakfast or whatever there, moved around, come back took the car and go back.
So, what are the values of those Hiccup those X, Y and Z?
So, we get as near accurate as a heuristic value as possible.
Big problem.
And we have looked at some of the components like positional importance of the node we have seen, because that is to be considered in SEF .
Now, in the beginning you may feel that the problem is almost the same as the previous one.
In this module we are going to talk about a typical method which is used to handle most of the AI problems.
So, while coming back, you look at two things: the prerequisite okay .
And there are many candidate structures.
What is the branching factor?
Okay That's the next thing.
And you can see that for on BA you can add action called place on top BA and on A table you can put on table and now this is done.
That sometimes happens due to radiation or some external this thing also, input also.
You know Google Maps it’s using the Google Maps Google Car is using Google Maps but how will you represent that?
When that particular node that you’re planning to choose is explored a little further it is called secondary search.
Similar example is some surveillance case, okay .
A GA obviously is based on one simple principle which Darwin gave long back; survival of the fittest.
Now, two important characteristics of best first search.
It looks at all possible moves, next to next moves and next to next moves and so on as long as the time permits and out once it it is done it'll return back which move is better for me.
I’m not doing it blindly and that’s why this is called guided search and not blind search or unguided search.
If the summation is beyond a threshold value, a typical threshold value, it outputs one otherwise it output zero.
Something which has not changed for long, change it and see if you can reach to some solution, okay .
With that we end with this module.
okay .
So, that thats great things about life forms and the same thing we are going to have adopt in GA that is adopted in GA to solve problems.
okay the the it’s going to be played by the opponent.
This I am This person is recognized clearly.
You can see that there are total eighty-one inputs out of it, some of them are zeros and some of them are one.
You can see that the representation Sachin and PTRANS.
And that’s why it is called feed forward network.
Okay if we we'll we’ll let our study about heuristic we'll have some idea how we can choose one move out of most.
In fact, there's not one problem.
One is rho, rho value of that piece.
I just find out a mapping Okay , element in parent two and find out the position of that element in parent one, so D is at the position of four.
When somebody tells us something like this and we don't know what Epicurean is we will ask what is it? Okay .
Okay , that that indicates that thing you can see that the recipient of that is is LA.
But in simulated annealing there is no temperature.
Now, this is the problem .
So, this associative search is also something where human brains are far better compared to us the computers.
In metallurgy when the new alloys are made, they are melted at high temperature and they are allowed to cool down in a controlled manner.
So there are many factors.
Okay , look at that.
You can create your list of entities so that your chatbot can identify and retrieve them from user responses.
So there are two components which are used.
Guided search methods use heuristics.
Okay , let me even talk about, the pheromone value is the length is is inversely proportional to length.
Now this is a cycle .
And in this particular simple script I've talked about scene scenes which are normal, expected or default sequences of events which is which are likely to happen when the script is invoked.
And when you talk about scripts, when they are invoked, those default things are overridden by by the information that is provided in the script.
For example, one more capability of gene gene is to make sure that you you will have some characteristic for example ability to climb trees and swim and so on.
Okay , the rule number eight talks about the place where the conceptualization occurs.
Then you should be able to explain me.
Now, if you if you ask a chess player given a board position, two board positions which one is better, he would say, this is better or that is better.
For example, if I have two consecutive cells occupied and the third one is empty, it’s a very good thing, I I can just play the next move there and I’ll I’ll win so is that also a very good state.
And where there's some guided search already applied in the problem domain it becomes so small that you can you cannot worry about you don’t need to worry about heuristic, you just try exploring all possible option and solve them.
There’s the other slanting line which moves from left to right down and the other one which is horizontal.
So one cannot assume at this point that the output of a machine translation engine is always good.
What if there is a function called H dash which which just negates that value? What you get is a lower value.
Now, here k again is a layer which I was talking about.
Let me repeat that both the components as well as the associated weight is experts’ decision.
So it is become so for our case there are total three sixty different tours possible between these seven cities.
Now that is called simple single point crossover.
So, that something is represented as Do.
Now interestingly there is one action, we are putting A on table.
And it can combine sequences for better and non-isolated kind of reasoning.
Okay same way Milkha Singh ran yesterday.
I saw the match, or I watched.
You don’t have complete information about the current status but you will soon be able to find your own way out, based on the old memories little part of something that you can remember.
With that, we’ll come to an end of this particular module.
The conceptual dependency is little better way of doing that, where we have lot of restriction on the type of links that we can have, type of nodes that we can have and how they can relate to each other, making it a very, very strong knowledge representation technique.
They travel along that and again, they start travelling in a random fashion but usually along the obstacle.
And also the detailed this thing description of script probably will have scoreboards and many other things, the screens and so on so forth.
X is the amount of milk in jug the eight gallon jug.
Image of some other object is provided and it says it is the friend.
Frame is a very simple structure, a script is comparatively more complex.
On BC so you have on A table, on D table, on C D on BC.
So we use that word here, as well.
And I've told you in the previous module, the best approach to design an expert system is to build a very simple prototype, and recursively modify it to represent or convert to the final system, that's the best approach.
Hill climbing is simple.
How many output units do I need?
You just pick up a solution and see if it is so and in in hill climbing you actually pick up the better state. Okay .
Now, that's not the case here.
So, this is what we are we are supposed to do.
Generate a random number R between zero and one, okay .
So, that is is something which is more readable .
You see the example, minus five, four and zero four three.
Machine learning (ML) is a branch of AI that allows chatbots to identify patterns in human language and learn from past conversations.
The the ants which carry that food are coming back on the same trail.
So, you need to increase summation even for correct answers.
In fact, branch and bound is possible to be used with other algorithms as well.
As is already given at minus nine.
But, eventually what we get when we use heuristic is is the estimate of how far we are from the goal node.
In normal cases you require twenty five, thirty thousand epochs.
Okay what's the difference?
Test if it is a solution.
So if if all possible cases are explored together, if one of if the later, he uttered some word which prohibits one of the translations, the other translations can still be tried.
Then you can say that, at pawn black i,j minus two you just move pawn two steps further and where earlier the pawn was that place is blank.
So but we’re doing it, Okay so we’re we’re picking up, we’re we’re taking that as correct and we’re going forward.
If it is not , what should I do?
Boat can carry maximum two.
Testing is again as I said a very, very critical part.
So the process is to like to go to the goal state as near to goal state as possible and once we reach to the nearest possible case, we apply static evaluation function, see what it offers and based on that we find out what the parent offer and parent to parent and all that.
The one more possibility is 0,5,3.
When I apply maximum, I get the same answer.
And here, the example is watching a match which we have seen in the last module.
Thank you.
And and you can use For example, ATRANS .
Because these scenes are directly introduced into the the target representation when that statement is encountered.
Heuristic value is not an exact answer and that’s why it it has to be that way.
okay .
For example, how the navigator represents the problem itself moving across ?
So if you if you give some human being this problem to solve, probably he will be able to do it in few minutes.
There is a weight between X one okay , remember, the X zero and H zero look like inputs but you can see that there is no arrow going inside.
So, Ram ‘Do’.
Okay , breath is again taking air in.
So, it's not that this is the primitive, these these are the primitives or this is the list.
H one H one W one J, H one W two J and so on.
That R which is again a three-prong structure which is R indicates is a recipient case relationship.
In this particular module, we're going to look at the remaining four of them.
So we use that thing as a heuristic.
We are talking about missionary cannibal problem and something.
If this node is better than this I’ll just go, that’s called hill climbing.
Webhooks, also called a web callback, are automated API responses.
So, we get that okay .
If it is more than whatever you you can fill the the the three gallon jug and whatever is remaining is there in the five gallon jug.
Images of the friend that we would like to recognize and some other images, with only two things.
It doesn't force it prematurely.
what is ‘Do’?
That means that farmer is either on one side or the other.
It just have some set of constraints.
Cloning tool
one of the exceptional example of Depth-first search is is used by Prolog.
A greeting is a short message that welcomes website users and encourages them to start a chat.
Now, those weights every remember, every input unit is connected to every output unit.
And the third one was a clever mathematical representation.
Now three. Okay .
So, free B on A table okay this is additional.
Done.
It’s pretty dynamic .
Numeric 1 could not be detected at all.
So, if it does not recognize you just change, continuously change those weights, eventually it will converge into that set and you may ask me, if you ask me, what’s the guarantee that you have.
So that is the problem with hill climbing.
And the example is something that we've seen in the previous module. Milkha Singh ran, okay .
That's one reason.
okay So, let us move on.
We are not talking about domain knowledge, we are not talking about anything, we are just talking about resemblance of the intermediate state with the final state and the start state.
What does it mean?
Where ABCD belongs to LR.
Other cited examples include Microsoft's development of a Skype system that can automatically translate from one language to another and Facebook's system that can describe images to blind people.
But beyond D you just use the heuristic to estimate the remaining path.
In this particular module, we have seen branch and bound, we have looked at in the In fact, we began with ant colony optimization and we looked at how ant find the food source and then how one can mimic a computer program to do the same.
Once this is done, I'm entering into the next phase.
Eventually , what I get is three two.
okay . And the genome in human case is a long stand of estimated thirty five thousand DNAs in humans.
In fact, that’s the reason why in many cases what you’re supposed to do is to for example, you’re exploring chess and after six levels you cannot explore seven, it is too much for you and you choose one node.
You will have to decide program logic for this.
Now you talk about two different scripts in this particular statement - watching a match and coming back by bus.
You've already seen in semantic net that we we can represent the natural language statements using some links and some nodes.
Current state is on A table on BA on CD on D.
And thats that makes the the other elements available to us.
Like when you say that ‘When I I went to watch a match’, which basically represents many things into one. How that is done, we’ll we’ll we’ll be looking at in scripts the next module.
Implicit assumptions there in the program itself.
Now you can see this example.
Before we embark on the real algorithm, there's one more word which is commonly used in the literature called W and B.
I've talked about the primitives which are most commonly used and represented but you can see that this is one view and please understand that this is Schank’s view.
How we do it?
Bstar is little different.
So you don’t add them in the explored array and that’s the reason we’re keeping that array, clear nose Okay .
Whenever we encounter that word, we'll take that form out and we'll just use placeholders from the statement.
We explore the leftmost 3,5,0 and left with 0,5,3.
Precondition is that A has to be free, that is, nothing should be resting on A then and then you can put it on table otherwise you cannot.
Again we are not going to do that further here.
We’ve already seen AI is trying to solve difficult problems and difficult means is something that is hard for computer to solve, not humans.
When we reach to the the sixth ply, our time gets over.
You have minus three, then minus five, minus two and three are the children.
So, such things, such moves such states are better compared to others.
We begin with zero zero and you can see the sequence on the slide.
Pretty simple?
W one is layer one, W two is layer two, I and J.
Okay 5,0,3 there is one typical result is again 8,0,0 which again we’ll not explore further because it is a cycle.
So, heuristic function should have two important characteristics, should closely match the the the real value and should be as fast as it it can be.
So, that's a precondition you can't do that.
This method is useless .
These sub-fields are based on technical considerations, such as particular goals (e.g. robotics or machine learning), the use of particular tools (logic or artificial neural networks), or deep philosophical differences.
The only difference is the the boat is on the right hand side and we are moving from right to left.
So again in this case, though a lot of other things are mentioned script should not be invoked.
okay?So the the point is, There is no point exploring the next branch.
Okay , number six which move to choose?
But there is no other relationship okay .
So, this is an example where you can use back propagation neural network.
Back propagation algorithm is something which is used to train neural networks.
But these are the basic building lob blocks of CD .
So, when you when you learn something to the contrary of what whatever is mentioned in the script, they no no longer be there in the script which is activated, Okay .
You just pour milk from here to here and here back , you won't get to a solution , but you won't come to an end as well.
But in case of A, you will almost invariably find them.
The Kinect, which provides a 3D body–motion interface for the Xbox 360 and the Xbox One, uses algorithms that emerged from lengthy AI research as do intelligent personal assistants in smartphones.
But let us again pick up a problem like chess and it’s it's becomes impossible for us to get an answer.
Attendees Allen Newell (CMU), Herbert Simon (CMU), John McCarthy (MIT), Marvin Minsky (MIT) and Arthur Samuel (IBM) became the founders and leaders of AI research.
I was talking about those twenty then pick up five; so these twenty strings that you pickup in the beginning is called a solution set or is called population. okay .
In fact it can answer many many questions.
The simplest of hill climbing you apply one of the rules, look at what you get and that node if that node has a better value you just move there.
When you say throw, what does that mean?
And we have already seen that, that how the script can be invoked.
sneeze The other one is called EXPEL, forcefully throw out something, for example, when I'm crying, the the tears EXPEL out of my eyes and one more called SPEAK, generate a sound, Okay .
okay The other things are same like you can see PTRANS ‘Sachin to restaurant’.
Place on top BA dot deletion intersection SS should not be phi, it should remove something which is there in the start state which again you will see that there is something called free A which was there in the start state, now it is removed.
Genetic algorithm is little different from conventional AI techniques that is recently added; in fact it is some other researchers do not call it part of AI .
This is precisely what we are going to address in this module, how to search, how it is possible to search.
Remove the noise from the image
Height is example of a state okay .
The outputs of the self-attention layer are fed to a feed-forward neural network. 
See I started with A, , the the element correspond to A and parent two is D, the the same D appears at position number four in this case, so D at position four is copied, Okay , here.
Quite similar to the plan space planning which we have talked about long back.
okay What about this state?
I I just said a few times, a processor that’s a this is a processor learning, what exactly is a process?
And it is so you can see minus one you explored where one is three, other one is four.
I already discussed that.
It indicates the relation between two picture producers or two objects.
And Offspring the child, the children’s genome basically is a combination of parents.
Okay , this is again different than the hill climbing because if this were hill climbing, one cannot be explored, it has lesser value than two.
And and this again has default information.
okay clears nose And similarly, M two is greater or equal to C two and M two equal to zero okay otherwise.
So, it won’t remain at as attractive as possible as as it it should be after a while.
It is also possible that in fact, empirically it is it has solved many problems.
Every city is directly connected with every other city, so we have lot of paths,
Now, what what set of motivational strategies would will be able to actually retain the employees.
Some authors describe the the layer in the beginning.
Consider the input coming from lot of frames, sensors and all that.
Just take the case of branching factor twenty .
All explored nodes are kept in the other area.
So, transition finished and TS transition starting, commencement and conclusion, both are possible.
There are a lot of other complexities.
The rule number fourteen is one of the simplest.
Minus ten.
Now you can see that the parent one B, G and A there are B, G and A, they are not to be copied into the child.
And to maximize the crystal size of solid this thing , there is something called the annealing schedule which is followed.
I I have to be hungry, and I have to have money.
As I said, a single conceptualization talk about a very simple, involves a single primitive.
Minus ten to ten is what we have already used.
It is not easy in fact, you probably have heard about a robot which makes pizza but that's the only thing that robot can do and only if everything is stacked exactly for his requirement .
So, we’ll come across this once again.
One, we have minus three and minus four.
For example, two student frames are almost everything, same except the values of the attribute.
If I say any two I'll have again much more.
But is an interesting idea and probably a lot of others have used that idea and we are going to stress that idea.
We’ll explore the right child of the parent , that is 1,5,2, again a left, 1,4,3 1,4,3 then we have 4,4,0.
It is possible to represent a problem in two different ways.
So, these are the A's which are provided to the system and you can see that in this case some of the it’s pretty crude representation but it's still possible for us to understand how it works.
An example, I I when I'm pushing something, I'm propelling, but the direction is opposite to me, when I'm pulling, I’m again propelling but the direction is different, you can see that and this is something which I was constantly trying to talk about since the beginning,that these are primitives, a very simple forms form of representation which can actually represent multiple , many, many verbs together.
At the end we'll see that there is something which is possible to be applied to this, which improves our search process and the next module we'll we'll see that thing in a little more detail.
Only farmer can row the boat, obviously grain and fox and chicken cannot.
This is called tour.
So, the point is inputs are flowing in the forward direction, the errors are flowing in the backward direction.
So you can see that the call is made to to MiniMax.
They make decision based on that local information which they have and each component, each ant is going to decide its path on its own and many ants work together, okay , for food source and when some of them find the food source, others will tend to follow this path and after some time they converge on that path.
Then we’ll apply static evaluation function to each children.
So, props also change, default set of props, obviously are there but additional you may have them additional ones.
In fact for travelling salesman problem the fitness function is pretty simple, the total distance covered negatively is the fitness function. okay .
It can be divided into curve and round and broken and all that .
Component, its weight component, its weight component its weights.
Fr is farmer, fx is fox, ch is chicken and Gr is grain.
That nodes here it shows that dark nodes are either repeated or something which are already explored. Okay .
However, the shorter schedule requires that the original machine translation output is of sufficiently good quality.
First, we would like to win as long as possible.
There are two things to be done, what we want here A on the table and B on top of A.
For example, Let us, we have few examples okay .
Farmer, fox, chicken and grain on the left-hand side, nothing on the right hand side.
You can see that ‘R’ okay and other thing also we have seen.
Thanks to machine learning, properly programmed AI chatbots can improve over time without the help of a human.
So, if you use a breadth first search you are likely to get the solution much faster.
We know that these many possible, so that many nodes. Okay .
What does that mean?
It just looks from all possible state states that you can generate, we will only choose some of them, we will not choose all, will choose only few and plausible better moves compared to others.
If the slope is like this, if slope is more steep than the earlier case, little change in a way it will increase the output much further.
Eventually, you’ll run out of actions all all actions are applied at the state that we achieve is a goal state, we are done.
So, here you can see that C is resting on top of D and B is resting on top of A in in case of a goal state and there are two possibilities, there's do two things that you can do you can place B on the table or you can place C on the table and you chose to do the first the second one placing C on the table.
The number of missionaries on the left hand side must be greater than number of cannibals on the left hand side or number of missionaries are zero.
The mental information is being transmitted, okay , for example, let us take a verb called ‘Remember’,
Remember the heuristic value, the static evaluation function value and maximizing layer will pick up a node with maximum value and the minimum layer will pick up that by minimum value.
Now, there are two different set of weights, okay .
By the middle of the 1960s, research in the U.S. was heavily funded by the Department of Defense and laboratories had been established around the world.
Okay so it has all all data about Garry Kasparov, all with the the amount of moves and all that and so on and so forth.
But it is basically mutation is never considered good in humans but in here in this case, mutation sometimes is used for there is a reason and is very similar to something that we have seen in this thing ,
The heuristic value is just an estimate.
Okay .
Usually the randomness allowed is more in the initial part of the search process and less in the lesser part of the search process.
Expert utilization is given the highest priority.
One is how will if you have a move, which controls the center, it is better than other moves.
Well, we see genetic algorithms are very good at those kind of problems where you have to apply perturbation search, Okay .
You can see that in this case, we'll have to move our king and sacrifice our queen.
Okay . Apply heuristic function, see which one is better.
Handle the different lightning condition in the image
So, that's the power of CD .
Therefore, according to Occam's razor principle, a learner must be designed such that it prefers simpler theories to complex theories, except in cases where the complex theory is proven substantially better.
In fact, GA has shown that it can actually solve some serious AI problems not sorted for years.
okay , there are a lot of things.
So, we are not going towards goal we're going so going away from it.
Usually you look at all this information and whether see whether this statement contains some of these script headers.
So this is also very, very critical phase.
I've told you that on A table is part of the goal state and that is what it is.
What we do not want is fox and chicken.
In the initial run bad moves are allowed almost with equal probability as of the good move but later on it is almost zero.
That throwing stone is used as an instrument to to get this the other thing done.
Some algorithms, which we are going to study later requires this function to be continuous. Okay , so we have sigmoid function is to be used.
Okay there are a lot of other prerequisites that the match you must be at the same place where match is happening and so on and so forth which I’ve not talked about.
Okay . A process called random walk is is about its very similar to our generate and test.
I may say that I'll only change two of the states.
Whatever we have done so far is called Path Representation.
Additionally, we also seen the SEF being a a composite structure it contains it’s basically a weighted value okay multiple components multiplied by their respective weights.
And we have already seen that AI programs don't have AI problems don't have the algorithms , AI solutions don't have the algorithms, so you you just don't have a a a clear cut method to begin from initial state to reach to the final state.
Bot: Thanks! How can I help you, Anna?
Okay , now let us see you using the formulae that we have used to see if this is relevant.
We cannot proceed further.
It is done by applying something called a heuristic function.
What we do is from current state from current state we remove additions and then add preconditions.
Why we need that?
So those Constraint Satisfaction part uses that test, so it is generating and testing them.
Offspring inherit genes and attributes and then this thing the process produces next generation and once you get the new generation the old generation is just wiped off,
If you only consider uppercase, thirty-six uppercase plus the digits and fifty-two when you consider upper lowercase and together.
Those are all implicitly mentioned when we talk in in a normal way.
Because, experts will have to look at all those resumes.
You’re you're doing nothing you won't achieve anything out of but playing at the corner which is shown in B, we have two possible options.
Why A at the end?
You can say Sachin gave his bat to Sarfaraz. So Sachin ATRANS okay you can look at that representation.
Here, we don't do that, okay though we say that.
Okay .
Okay , so we’ll be talking about them.
But not in all cases.
Okay , so those fleeting scripts is also an interesting problem.
The same thing happens here as well.
I'll have only ten different children.
In GA , we know that the solutions are broken apart and reconnected and find best solutions.
Second question that, what are the impacts of these decisions?
okay , so every time we'll do this process.
Try to see and try to understand.
It is max so I'll the player is playing.
So, that is to be so this process is to be continuously repeated for all such paths.
If no city left return back, but otherwise return back with the length and if and then check the length.
They they pick up random solutions in the beginning.
When you say greater than average the context determine what's the value on on on an average.
Is one more thing.
Sometimes, even direction is to be mentioned.
There is something called Soft Computing.
And you you may pick up two, three or four best and then again you expand them and so and so forth.
And there are two other examples.
And what you do is you pick up a better node.
One of them is hill climbing.
And there are total paths, I have drawn all possible paths on the screen.
The issue is that in case of G, if in in most handwritten case recognition, you will not find that horizontal line.
Basic brain neuron is roughly divided into three parts, one is called Dendrites, which is basically an input device, something which provides input to the cell, the the nucleus of the neuron which which has a long cord which is called Axon and which again it is distributed in small tiny threads okay .
Great! See, now try to understand it is L M one C one, R M two C two and BL.
If you if you go back and look at your our exploration of eight five three gallon water jug problem or if you explore this three four gallon water jug problem and so on so forth, you will find that in most cases the rare number of nodes are are more likely to yield to solution, yield solution.
So, script interpretation resolution of ambiguity, Okay , can answer this question just because it was based on the scripts.
Okay , let us try to understand the process which it derived from.
Second, if this suppose, if you know how to write this function, how you put this function to use.
Who is playing it?
2019-11-06-Machine-Translation-illustration
But again, for the classification also that is a generate and test.
These methods are are , either preserving order or position or both in a way that they allow better qualities of the parent to persist over the generation.
One more way is to like for example let us take the same missionary cannibal case.
What does that do?
A chat widget hosts your chatbot and enables users to converse with it.
Now, interestingly, when you start doing it this way, there can be three different types of outputs.
In our case we pick up a range from minus ten to ten. Minus ten is losing plus ten is winning but then some other value indicates how promising that node is.
Thank you!
And the state generated , should not be generated again , that is what we mean by a cycle.
So that’s a very good example of how one can use generate and test.
How it's state is chosen?
So, you don't need to look for symptoms of malaria or typhoid and all that.
The point is all these things are assumed to be part of it and script is something which which represents this expectancy driven scenario Okay .
What is the precondition for place on table A?
We’ll soon see.
Okay , the next search method that we’re going to we’re going to talk about is called best first search.
We have already seen the chess representation, the matrix representation and the the move representation.
If you do that for thirty less than anything less than thirty two, five units are good.
So, that’s precisely the the theme of this particular module.
How can you represent the same problem in multiple ways and and what are the advantages of one type of representation or the other?
L zero zero zero zero and R one two four eight .
So, here we have three inputs, three hidden or middle layer units and two output.
So you can modify that.
Rule execution also is to be tested.
Not only that one very, very powerful mechanism, one very, very powerful inference that you can get out of script is that it can predict unusual events, unusual sequence of events and can see that there is something wrong. For example, ‘Jay went to watch the match.
The difference is not much.
So B is copied.
The the nucleus’ job is done by a function called the Sigma, okay .
In In conventional methods what we do is, you pick up a solution state, look at the heuristic value and then try move to some other solution space with solution state which is better.
What does that mean?
Just compare them.
An interesting thing here is like the first case is inserted, you test the system, second case is inserted, you test the system for both cases, third case is inserted, you test the cases test the system for third case and all that.
The figure clearly indicates how it is moving because it’s moving in the direction of the arrow, okay .
So, there is a weight between X zero and H one.
I'm actually I have cheated because I've already solved that problem and I know that this is how the problem is going to be solved.
If you know about that letter you may replace ‘do.’
That is called State Space two.
And it says that I'm adding something which is part of the goal state, which is not phi.
Okay but then there is one more thing > Okay .
Opponent is going to play the minus three.
The object is tears and it has direction relationship.
In the 2017 Future of Go Summit, AlphaGo won a three-game match with Ke Jie, who at the time continuously held the world No. 1 ranking for two years.
And if you if you remember the the thing that we have discussed, the interface of an expert system also quite different than conventional systems.
Sometimes the the moves are known as or written as Production rules.
So we are we are yet to fill the four positions.
GA is about representing problems in in form of a solution space.
For instance, the translation of the word ‘volume’ may refer to sound volume, a quantity of space or an amount, regardless of the actual context.
That is what we like we would like to prevent the opponent to win okay .
Now whenever the other ant ants start moving, what that does it do, it looks at all possible paths and there is a high probability that it chooses a path with a higher value of pheromone.
There are a lot of other properties which makes MOP a far better solution than scripts.
okay This is how it is done?
Remember why we are exploring multiple players?
So, the figures, the three figures in the handout as well as the PPT clearly indicates this part.
We are multiplying it with minus one and pass it up. Why we are doing it?
ok The current state, every time I have to take a move, the current state is given to the algorithm.
Well when we reach to an unreachable or unaccepted.
And how have I done it?
So that's precisely what we say we disallow six, twelve and fourteen.
So, the terminating criteria comes here.
We begin from initial state and reach to the final state.
They help users make their decision faster and improve the flow of the conversation.
And you can see the best first search the next figure in the the slide shows how best first search works.
N inputs are presented.
Now, if there is a local minima, local maxima whatever, when it is moving around and it falls into local minima or climbs up local maxima, it cannot go forward.
Okay , but then there is a catch, catch is you have ordered them in this way fashion on A table and on BA.
What you need is support planning, how you do it, okay .
Maintenance and extension is also part of this part, but the maintenance is not only maintaining the expert system, but continuously improving it for quite some time.
Until you reach to the cycle you copy from parent one, once you reach you copy from parent two.
Pick up the start node and make it current, Okay , the start node and take up all nodes, and store them in the sorted order of heuristic value.
Now, ‘kill’ is represented using this statement.
Okay . You may have your own, completely your own set of primitives, you can still solve the problem, but this is an excellent solution.
If it is not phi, good; the state is relevant.
So if you have fox and grain on one side, absolutely no problem.
Can you write a program to do it?
Okay , let us recap what we have looked at in this particular module.
And DNAs are replicated in the offspring,
The prototype is analyzed on technical grounds.
So if you're trying all possible alternatives, you can make the decision.
Chatbot greeting
And this change, for example, if you go out to have watch a cricket match and you buy a pavilion ticket, you probably will have an additional food coupon.
I've already discussed this.
Nearest neighbor was only for TSP .
The ppt is is talking about this four three gallon jug problem, two rules one is specific and the other one is general, the eight five three gallon milk jug, again there is a specific and a general rule and also a state space representation .
Similarly, the statement here is converted to some basic collection of some basic primitives.
okay .
So when we encounter a statement, Jay want went to watch a cricket match P is replaced by Jay Okay .
So, this is a relevant state relevant progression.
Okay , let me tell you one more thing, this is my way of representing.
For example, I'm viewing a cricket match.
We have already seen examples of a general and specific roles.
The other way around, if you provide the friend’s image and the summation is less than what is expected is called negative misclassification, okay .
They actually begins with solution search method.
We’re looking at just all nodes, Okay .
Now look at the example shown on the screen, it it has a goal state and has a previous state.
Now, the first neuron here connects to first second and third.
If it is not, he cannot do it.
The pheromone evaporates at constant speed and the ants are capable to smell the pheromone value and so on so forth and tends to follow the path with the strongest pheromone value and and I've already told you that it it depends on two things - more ants travelling on that path where number of the amount of pheromone is more and the path is more recent the value is more.
So, these are assumptions .
And we what we want is we want everybody remain intact at the end of the problem and if the farmer is not around, fox may eat chicken and chicken and may eat grain.
It propagates the errors back.
Now such kind of, if else, is possible using something we'll see and we'll see examples of all of them C is conditional, C indicates that the relationship is conditional, if this happens that will happen, if else, kind of if, then kind of a relationship.
In database design, probably if you've gone through a database paper, you know that there is a problem called knowledge redundancy.
Now there are two alternatives and and remember I'm not looking at the lower most level now.
So what we’re doing is is is kind of a generate and test, we’ll just look at a sequence.
In the early 1980s, AI research was revived by the commercial success of expert systems, a form of AI program that simulated the knowledge and analytical skills of human experts.
So, either B or F is zero.
Now is it a good thing to have?
But it is basically not.
Eventually it will reach to us and we'll looking at which will decide which out of which four children that we have which one is better for us.
Okay for example, here he has to wait for fifteen minutes and that angers him.
Okay Looking at picking keeping that thing in mind let us look at this.
Some of the learners described below, including Bayesian networks, decision trees, and nearest-neighbor, could theoretically, (given infinite data, time, and memory) learn to approximate any function, including which combination of mathematical functions would best describe the world.
Here, we can change this, we can actually mimic this by changing the program itself, the way we could.
He enjoyed playing cricket with his friend there.’
Now, you can see that there is a deviation which clearly indicates that watching a match does not happen.
For example, think of a robot domain.
The other case we are placing B on top of table.
Right now we have no clue.
For example, you you doing hill climbing and you stuck there.
So, we had M one before.
L M one M one.
We’ll begin with three types of situation which is the outcome of Tic Tac Toe.
Okay , we in fact you can go further and get the answer but best first search basically is is the search where you use heuristic value and you just pick up the best node irrespective of what your children are and what the parent’s heuristic value is.
Okay , my pocket for example which I I just did.
Now what is branch and bounds?
That mean again assume that your input, the state space is is presented in a way that is a collection of some components.
But okay , but the case number one is A is good B is not very good C is comparatively better than B because B when we are playing B we don't have any like one part is already full.
The meaning of the statement appears in in in the representation and interestingly because meaning is represented, it becomes very easy for somebody to infer from it, something which otherwise is just not possible.
You can see that, and it's called direction case.
This brain is very different than computer the computer processor and now we’ll be discussing about the differences between these two.
So that what does that mean?
For example, if you encounter a statement like Jay asked for Italian pizza with double cheese, he waited for fifteen minutes, got angry and went away.
We don't really know what the source is.
Below, we will give you a step-by-step guide to training your own model using the Nanonets API, in 9 simple steps.
You also have to have some kind of performance assessment system.
Now this is a a mixture of CD representation as well as the the normal language.
And one great thing about GA is that it can handle the combinatorial explosion problem, Okay .
That’s the first thing.
We need a rule of thumbs and that's precisely what we are going to discuss in the next module.
So this is how you get the child one.
That is quite different than other algorithms.
That row value is basically a function which checks for a threshold value.
The simplest of hill climbing you don’t do that.
Say what will you do?
SEF returns what?
For example, a KE would say that what are the decisions that you make.
Now let us look at the other case.
So, why we are talking about Unguided Search Methods too?
Okay , we're not talking about because here in in the simplest representation, we have not talked about fellow spectators, we have not talked about umpires, we have not talked about assuming a cricket match, we have not talked about the ball boys and all that.
Now, we move to L three one and R zero two.
We say that, the state space is is represented by X Y Z where X plus Y plus Z is eight.
It was full of this secret programming language that was out of reach for the average reader.
The case number one, placing CD on the table the action was not relevant.
So I have five different children.
In fact if I say that, any any city exchanged with any other city then I am going to have around three sixty.
So that and number of cannibals also are reduced.
Now how will I how will you write that problem? I'm not asking for a solution. How will you characterize the problem? It's not that easy.
Machine translation can help decrease or even eliminate the language barrier in communication.
Sometimes it is not the object but instrument.
So it's good that you explore multiple nodes.
It is not so.
We don't really know, in fact.
And this is something which I've already explained.
Remember ant adds a pheromone value equal to the constant value C divided by the path length.
So, if the X is greater than or equal to three, so here we have more amount of milk.
Now, if you want to find out the cost to reach to that city, you can assume that that cost in the final tour, that city is connected to two nearest neighbors okay .
But despite all this, the basic things that I'm going to talk about is the same.
Okay quite exaggerating.
Progression is moving towards the goal state, regression is coming back from the goal state.
So we’ll not choose components which does not have much of an effect.
But there is one more example.
Okay , now you might be getting the feel for the problems AI researchers are facing over the years.
Now, this is also is very important component for generating a component for SEF .
The security person asked him to stand in a queue. There was heavy rush on the ticket counter and the queues are very, very long.
So that dependency is one way.
Now, it clearly indicates that six,zero,two is better than others.
Bit number one is farmer, bit number two is fox, bit number three is chicken, bit number four is grain.
Genome contains something called chromosomes.
And what does that mean? That means that it is ten, it is win for us, the problem is solved, Okay .
And once that is done, it becomes easier to infer, it becomes easier to translate into other languages.
Not only that, formalization also talks about checkpoints and deadlines and it will give you a timeline then, in two months’ time, this is part is to be done, next two months, this is to be done and so on, so forth.
The okay , you can see that when Ram killed Ravan, Sita was happy.
Okay , and it’s also subjective.
So, that's the next thing that we are going to talk about is a method to optimize.
So it's possible for somebody to write rules for it?
In this case, the first level you have one node, second level you have two, next level you have four.
But if I get a response from a medical system that you’ve got a blood cancer, I would ask, why, why you are telling me so?
In this case the action is relevant.
The other thing how many samples do I need?
So you you can always, once you explore that entire tree you can apply heuristic and find out which moves are better compared to others.
So, all those things are involved which is not represented here. okay .
We’re going to pick up a very simple problem called three-four Gallon water jug problem. Now this is also described in in a book called Elaine Rich.
You can see that the PPT talks about the obstacle and the ants are finding.
If, this is also not the case, we have multiple children.
Fox is on the right hand side, F will be two but then both of them cannot be two.
Axon connects itself to dendrites of other neurons.
This option is for situations where a translation is needed as soon as possible.
How do you decide that this user this user is to be blocked?
Okay . You probably think that it’s a bit wasteful.
And we have already seen that it is possible to learn from the domain which moves are better than others.
Annealing schedule is basically how you're going to cool the alloy down.
As mentioned in the paper, it runs near real-time at 13FPS on 720p images with high text detection accuracy.
D is not free because there is something else called X resting on it.
What does that mean?
So, they are related by a single single sided because the dependency is only on one direction and there is an indicator O which indicates that is an object for this particular action.
okay , I can tell that your king is under attack and king has no place to move.
Okay , the heuristic search process.
We have seen what AI is and we have seen how to represent problems using state space and we have seen how to search .
Okay .
So twenty will happen for first five iterations then reduce by two so, so on so that that is what it stores.
It's based on the player as well as the state.
For example, when you say that Sachin is a cricketer, the the two entity Sachin and cricketer will have double arrow, all darkened like this, okay .
So this is precisely what I'm doing.
We have also looked at the Alpha and Beta cutoff at the end of this this module.
So delta is decrement in the value of the objective function when you talking about a new state you see how decrement it happens.
In practice, it is seldom possible to consider every possibility, because of the phenomenon of combinatorial explosion, where the time needed to solve a problem grows exponentially.
It is very simple, it pickup the any city at random, it pick up the first city at random and that is the city.
Now that is a pretty complex problem and that is where this power of computation, power of the technique resides.
And you will have to also identify sources like what are the sources of knowledge.
So, Ram is doing something.
cough So these are examples of entry conditions.
But there are multiple ways you can use this algorithm and there is some similarity between ACO and the other things that we have seen.
That is done many times in in in CD .
Filters
Basically temperature describes or determines the amount of bad moves to be allowed, okay .
At the maximizing layer, we have the same choice we’ll choose win, okay , so, because we are going to play.
Some cases one search method is better than some other cases, the other method is better.
Webhooks
Let me tell you it is quite possible that if a novice, a player is playing against Deep Blue and play a very stupid move, the Deep Blue will will get confused that what is happening.
Once they do it, once they are able to mimic the human brain, they are able to do many other things.
Instead of using the same heuristic function, you use some other route.
But understand that this is a very, very critical requirement for a function to be used in in in Back propagation like algorithm.
You can see this.
So, throw is little more complex, point is there there is a if there is a verb, which indicates physical transformation of any object, you will have to have PTRANS into that representation.
Often, the party offering a free translation service withholds the right to use the translated material.
What does that mean?
This is again an example of an invalid move .
But when you will choose when you switch over from the the sparse neighbourhood to dense neighbourhood.
So that third arrow points to the object which is being moved from this location to that location.
So, there is no destination shown here.
So I I'm taking fox but you can easily take grain on the other side.
If you if you do it only once, that's a problem.
That is not a very good idea, usually it is little forty five degrees okay is most common case.
For example, when you say that ‘Sachin bought a bat’ there is a concept called ‘store involved.’
what are the components for solving this problem?
Now, you can use what we have studied, but looking at the figure itself yes, okay .
Expectation of a normal user and a new normal user expects you to sympathize if he's having a serious disease or something like that.
Jay stayed in a queue for an hour or so got bored and returned back home.’
If it is not , you can pour everything that you can and whatever is left is is kept here.
What is a learning?
Okay , so you just see if if pawn at this place and the next next block is empty, then you just move that pawn there.
Let us try let us try to understand the algorithm now.
But you can change that slope here and there, to improve the speed and and let the algorithm solve the problem in faster, sometime that is needed.
Milkha Singh PTRANS himself to some other location or I PTRANS myself to some other location.
For a large expert system, it’s pretty critical.
We know.
If you don't do that,it will be eaten up.
So this is these
You can see that the second slide that the hidden unit which learn to active and there is an horizontal line, also learns to be active and there is I and there is H.
I'm not bothered about the sign right now but because I'm not worried about five or minus five, I worried about the child which returns that.
Natural language processing (NLP) is a branch of AI that helps computers read, understand, and make sense of the human language.
In this particular module we’ll be talking about syntactical rules about the conceptual dependency representations.
So total is basically collected from all ants travelled on that path and those ants which have not travelled on that path they’ll not contribute, okay .
Welcome friends, to the tenth module of AI .
So you you know, the direction from Mumbai to Los Angeles and so on so forth.
So, it just multiplies, xi wi, xi wi, x one w one, x two w two, x three w three at at this point of time I am not bothered about layers.
It is possible that sometimes even a piece a pawn has more value than a queen, sometimes okay .
So when you default is obviously a few, but whenever you encounter other information, you may add others Okay .
They are applied and what you get is the answer.
With that we’ll conclude.
Okay We have also seen how you decide number of input, output and hidden units.
So, what you do is you apply some other function which gives parent say five , but then two children seven and nine then you can pick up nine.
Okay
It is not.
DFS unlike BFS do not guarantee optimal solution.
How a output unit learns to remain active and for example is provided to it.
Think of a moving car, an automated car, which is actually taking lot of inputs from a lot of sensors across, lot of cameras and all that, the data structure that you're going to use is pretty complex.
That's all the pretty simple.
Think of it.
Because it's quite worse.
But believe me, in when you write the program, the program may try futile paths and probably be embarking on the right path.
Everybody can row the boat.
So, here that is what we are doing.
It’s a double arrow which which is darkened, and it says that height greater than average and you can see the representation - Height and there is a bracket in which you say greater than average.
Current player actually is either we or the opponent.
Chicken is four.
Remember branch and bound prefers the nearer, this thing , the nodes.
So, it will do it that way.
Okay , there's something called conceptual tense, which comes next there are single letter letter indicators, Okay , conceptual tenses for example, slash indicates negation, P indicates past tense, question mark indicates something which the information is not available, a kind of a placeholder, later, later on you might encounter, for example, you you encounter a statement like Sachin went to LA and then you probably will have a statement coming message, Sachin bought a a a necklace for his wife in Mumbai two days before.
We're going to the previous state and look at the description that we’ve provided.
So, you what you can do is now earlier we were talking about pouring milk in in three gallon water jug.
The other example is Ravan is dead.
What's the difference here?
And we we let us take the case of seven cities and we pick up a city as a root node and you just start travelling like you do.
We don’t really know how these weights encode the knowledge, but somehow at the end these weights are able to recognize signature, finding out the who the person is in the image and so on so forth.
So this is what is known as steepest ascent hill climbing.
So you get the farmer on the left hand side again.
But the other requirement.
okay .
I can move to six,zero,two.
So that that heuristic can help you finding better paths before and three more branches of search tree and obviously you will be able to gain a lot in terms of the search time.
And there is one situation which we are going to talk about.
So, that is one way of doing it.
We’ll again stress this thing once we talk about how anything is represented in CD .
However, machine translation is not a solution for all translation needs.
So I'll choose W and not L.
The development of metal–oxide–semiconductor (MOS) very-large-scale integration (VLSI), in the form of complementary MOS (CMOS) transistor technology, enabled the development of practical artificial neural network (ANN) technology in the 1980s.
Now let us pick up second one, G.
For example, genes will decide the color of the skin and the the type of teeth and the color of eyes and so and so forth.
Building a state space is what we have seen in last two modules, but that’s not enough.
Not only that, you can always apply a clear idea to simplify things.
Okay . We have already seen some domain knowledge.
It is quite possible in the script, some scenes are not executed at all.
how many?
Not only that, you can define variables and manipulate them in multiple ways.
So that, the whatever we study here is going to be useful there as well.
So, every day there are five thousand applications coming in.
So, when this happens, it is quite possible there are three possible outcomes.
It is possible to encode it actually
We’ll again start with 8,0,0.
The first generate and test is to find out which class the sample belongs to and then that generate and test is is to figure out what subclass that these sample belongs to.
We already seen one more method of binding it to a typical length and it’s called depth bound depth-first search.
So, this way, eventually you will be able to get an optimal path from any node to any node and this is precisely what we want.
The breadth first search we replace by branch and bound in all cases.
Okay and the second part of it says that if the farmer is on sorry the farmer is on the left hand side, you can’t have the same combination on the right hand side, okay .
We don't need to do anything else you can see that this is a very simple representation compared to all both of the representations before.
But once he put it on paper and in the the form as well as the report, expert will go through it and realize that this is the mistake and they may modify it there and then and that's the reason why KE should put everything that he knows into this thing the conceptualization.
X Y Z greater than zero or equal to zero, where we don't have negative values, X less than or equal to eight.
They retrieve information from chatbot conversations, like email addresses or telephone numbers, and pass them automatically to web services.
But okay its our our choice of words basically, otherwise its same.
Interestingly, two of my students implemented neural networks for a very different cases.
What should I do? I just look at my pocket, if it’s there and where I am hanging my keys.
It seems that stylized font with shadow in the background has affected the result in the above case.
Winding part that you’ve written does not happen first here, happens in the last function, last function which is involved, that unwinding part happens there, then the next to next, then the next to next and so on and at the end you'll come to the first function which is being called.
If it is less, i'll I am not going to play that move. I only play P.
Again , we reach to the final level, so we’ll not move further, we’ll take the right child of it, it is 8,0,0 it is repeated.
So, and we start with remember we start with the final one and eventually because it is a stack you pick up the top then it is the first action to be applied, apply that action to start state, change the state.
In many cases, the the recursive process is invoked just because of that unwinding part being done in this simplified manner.
B is mapping to B, D is mapping to G, E is mapping to A.
For the latter two cases, there is a solution that makes everyday information sharing and communication easier, even when there is a very large amount of text.
And also, it is it indicates that the hostage’s health which was earlier other than minus ten becomes ten because he's dead now.
This is about beginning from an initial state, move around in state space and stop when any one of the goal states is reached .
We have an additional information here that ‘yesterday’ which you can see that it is represented here.
You may be surprised re-running the program, how it solves?
Now we are increasing, increase the weights associated with all non-zero inputs so that’s what we are going to do in learning process.
For example, the person would say a lot of false negatives, uhlot a lot of false positives and those things.
The third factor is price: there may be massive amounts of documentation stored in archives that remain untranslated simply because of the cost.
A farmer is on the left hand side he cannot be on the right hand side, okay , where A belongs to obviously farmer or not farmer B, belongs to fox not fox, and so on so forth.
The model performed pretty well here.
One way to solve this problem is to have a database of some sort indicating all restaurants of Ahmedabad.
So, remember what is to be deleted - something with start state and not in the end state, that is to be deleted.
Why it’s called hill climbing?
The unwinding part in most of the recursive algorithm, the unwinding part is more critical because, every function contains that the winding whatever is there every function contains, whenever you have a function call made, this is a function which calls some other function.
So, it is not Fr not fx not chicken not grain what does that mean?
And how can we state so?
Okay , when we do that what happens?
So, we'll be talking about them.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, AI began to be used for logistics, data mining, medical diagnosis and other areas.
And suppose, if my heuristic function says that eight,zero,zero's heuristic value is minus five; six,zero,two is five; three,five,zero is three and three, two, three is four.
So, if some script contains something which is possible to be reused, the MOP can do that.
So, that's what this MOP does and there is something called PAM which is based on planning.
Now, how you solve this problem?
This is the limitation of the language itself.
But you can see that I I I'm exploring J.
Now very simple heuristic can be used here.
How have you done it?
So, that is again the second one, the second condition which is satisfied.
That conceptualization is Mahesh propelling a stone to Jayesh and you can see that there is a direction indicator as well it’s going from somewhere to Jayesh the object is stone.
You will have to find out those areas and make sure that they are addressed and and the performance is improved to the extent that is acceptable at expert level.
You, This If you use only that single layer of perceptron it cannot or perceptron or neural network, it cannot.
Now support planning requires you to like when you roll out the expert system, people take time to get used to it and they face more problems than conventional systems because these are different types of systems.
Anyway, let us talk about why it is an excellent method of solving some very, very interesting AI problems.
But is it so that the script is not relevant?
You probably have come across some cases where there is a typical bit which is set for something.
Physical annealing process allows the metal to cool down and reach to a stable state and it is found that the the process of cooling down has a serious impact on the the the stableness of the result and it allows some randomness in the movement.
So, that also it it is the negative value of threshold.
How it is done?
But look at ‘slash’.
But it's very critical that you you use that structure because it offers one of the biggest advantage of reusability.
Basically, this module is about extending our discussion on CD that we are talking about, how syntactic rules can be used to construct CD representation of the natural statement.
It’s basically a cumulative value which is made up of multiple components and we’ll be that is also something that we will be looking at.
So, for that purpose, we are keeping that placeholder here.
Because there is a likelihood of failure.
For example, for a given node I have twenty children,
The system can actually use all combinations of all these approaches.
Here we can say that a ticket is a prop, seat is a prop, and so on so forth.
Well, let us start.
Now, we decide the objective function value of the resultant state after applying this rule what we get is a worse state than this, okay .
Now you can see that there is a node minus three, which is explored three, which is also explored now which is being explored right now .
But then, later on researchers found that it if you want to get a if you have a very, very complex figure, where a feature itself is made up of other features, what you need is, multiple layers.
The Square function is sigma equal to zero to n xi yi . If it is greater than zero, it fires, less than zero, it doesn’t. Okay , is is very simple. If you draw a graph of it, you will be able to see that it is basically
It it it is not something which can be used to represent any any any statement that comes across and give you exact solution to that problem.
Machine learning
Ants, they’re spraying pheromone values.
You can't write algorithm.
There are multiple ways of doing it.
The experts are involved in this process.
Then you take up any one of them.
First, which are already explored.
I just skip that and I'm not skipping one path, I'm skipping many paths, because after D there may be nine branches.
Please also understand that this relevant part has nothing to do with heuristics.
So when you reach three it is dead end, you you won’t go further.
So there are many other tours possible.
Now you cough please understand.
Another sequence node two, another sequence node three and so and so forth.
So, basically, we are incrementing number of missionaries and cannibals on the left hand side and decrementing from the right hand side, the rest is the same.
okay I I could also have specified current I I only . okay current state only , but providing player will give me a better idea about how good or bad that function is.
I'm using a body part, so MOVE is also involved.
One way to do it is this.
Machine translation helps the organization share essential information better.
Many AI algorithms are capable of learning from data; they can enhance themselves by learning new heuristics (strategies, or rules of thumb, that have worked well in the past), or can themselves write other algorithms.
So what's the saving?
With that we’ll conclude.
There are many factors which determines whether, this one very raw factor is called piece advantage the number of pieces that I have, compared to number of pieces the opponent has.
And the third one is 5,3,0.
You cannot change its size, because that’s the input, that’s the image that is coming in, you cannot change that.
And both of them are used in practice.
We have already seen that.
But then in in rather chess its not all that good an example.
We have an initial state, we have a final state, we move around in state space so and so forth.
So, sometimes the search spaces are not finite.
You can see that such characteristics are very, very important for survival.
If they are similar, we don't need to move around start space is the goal state.
So that's what exactly next rule talks about.
So, it says that the bullet travels from gun, went into the hostage.
And you can see there are three things in in PDDL as I said there are three components of PDDL three things: preconditions, additions and deletions.
It's called conceptual tense.
One is called LOC or location, which talks about where this thing happened.
What does that mean?
But you can see that even in that case there are only two alternatives: one alternative is simple where you achieve one, the other one is achieved.
They plan that way.
Sometimes, all all possible combinations are entered in the goal stack and you try using all of them and get the best out of it, that also is possible.
For some texts, translation quality is the highest priority.
So, out of that B is a better move.
L is the side of the river, the left side of the river.
He received the news of sad demise of his grandfather and returned back now.
We are not going to discuss that thing right now.
I I will not give you a silver bullet to solve this problem and nobody in the world can do it.
Okay . These these type of search where if we don’t have any help from heuristic, we don’t have any domain knowledge, we don’t have any information about which move is better compared to others, we call it Unguided Search.
So that’s the first requirement.
But otherwise, the later two search methods will eventually stop.
Customers can get the translations they need in minutes.
If you have a move which can check the opponent’s king, it is better.
So, we we have seen some other examples earlier where we have clearly stated that this is the solution and we say that the program is going to do it that way.
We have seen that the the AI programs, one of the major obstacles in solving problems, the AI problems, is to characterize them precisely.
You've seen number of variables and number of symbols that one can use and and or and so on so forth.
you can see on the screen, its too huge a number.
Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1955, and in the years since has experienced several waves of optimism, followed by disappointment and the loss of funding (known as an AI winter), followed by new approaches, success and renewed funding.
So the track when you talk about a track, it talks about a particular type of that script.
So, these are examples.
How we do that is explained here.
Now it is actually possible to have around twenty different states.
It’s a huge company and a lot of resumes used to come and they have to have huge bunch of experts to look at those resumes and and shortlist resumes for further processing.
Those problems include a very simple problem called exoar .
Chat widget
So it could do it but otherwise it believe me it's going to be hard.
For example, when you find a statement called Jay want went to watch a match.
At this point of time we have not assigned any status to it, whether it is win leading to a win leading to loss or leading to draw.
So, whether you're doing it well, if you're not doing it well, whether your plan contains managing uncertainties - these are crucial ingredients for making the system run for a longer period.
Number of pieces their respective rating, for example, Queen is rated much higher than others and King is rated much, much higher than everybody else so on so forth.
Now remember, brain uses a stimuli, some information that is coming in, plus weight, okay .
And that is what I want my program to do actually, if I want to write an AI program.
So many paths are avoided using this branch and bound.
And now we are also stating what are number of missionaries and cannibals, okay , and so on and so forth.
And that happens in our manual case as well and the program is probably doing that as well.
The score determines how much focus to place on other parts of the input sentence as we encode a word at a certain position.
Now which move to choose given some alternatives is pretty hard problem.
The conceptualization, remember I had said in the previous module, the conceptualization is quite similar to the analysis in conventional system design process.
This is our probability.
One more You can even add one more.
So, we would like to increase cohesion in the segment and reduce coupling between segments.
How they are merged is based on a method called crossover.
And obviously, only those deer who who run fast and smell better can survive.
State space is basically an enumeration of all possible states that the problem can be in.
And obviously this this clearly indicates that we need heuristic based searches. Okay .
Now if there is a cycle in the solution path you may not reach to a solution because cycle may go on forever.
Now what those values are?
So there are some ways of telling which moves are better compared to others.
So, this is an example of rule number seven.
A channel is a place where a chatbot is launched and where users can interact with it.
Please understand, and this is not only in the case of missionary cannibal.
So, that was all three possible cases in Tic Tac Toe which is also the same in chess.
Now C and F, you can see that they are not part of the mapping and that is why they will have to be copied as it is.
Fine might require fine tuning in in long run.
If A is Fr farmer is on that side.
Now you can easily conclude that I must have much lesser than five hundred rupees by now, why because one of the requirements of dining in restaurant that you'll have to pay your bills.
We don’t have the value ten.
The earliest (and easiest to understand) approach to AI was symbolism (such as formal logic): If an otherwise healthy adult has a fever, then they may have influenza.
Okay .
When an understandable, useful and reviewed text is needed fast, the combination of machine translation and post-editing can be the right choice.
but the idea is really good, but still it is criticized.
They learn from their own experience. It’s very similar to us.
Same three, zero, two, four, four and six.
If you do not want to do it, just negate it.
What about chicken and grain?
And as I said, such connections are plenty, on an average one thousand connections.
After that you start the development process, okay , the basic framework in inference engine is decided, user interface is decided and core knowledge base is constructed, new class, rules everything, now is written implemented, the test data is inserted and start any ancillary part that is required is also added to this, okay , and testing and all that is required.
One was again done by Schank and all that.
But our current implementation does not provide rotating bounding boxes.
So, it learns faster.
Let us recap what we have seen in this particular module.
There is no feedback whether it is right or wrong.
M one M are substracted.
Similarly, you can see the other example of mental state.
For example, Milkha Singh ran is is Milkha Singh and PTRANS and the object is himself.
These are just examples of showing state with more heuristic value and less.
So this is what is is is is represented the word, whenever the word like read or or listen, for example, or hear or whatever of that type, okay .
You can just pour it inside and get it empty.
And not much of a difference.
I have to be there at the bus stand, kind of Okay .
The strength of human translators is still the quality of the translation.
Now you can look at this and see if placing C on the table whether it is nearer to start state placing C on the table is added while you move back.
We have seen depth-first search where we explore all nodes from a root node and try to see if it's the solution.
We start with an initial state and reach to the final state.
In fact, there is one more important type of learning which is left.
Sometimes the expectation is that user expects you to explain its reason, which is not there in a conventional system.
Okay Let us begin with the introduction of something called heuristic function.
We don't need to do it.
So why it is not desirable?
That is called planning, okay .
That's the power and that's the usefulness of beam search because here you don't have time to go back.
If the first player has played something the second player will not be in a position to use that.
Obviously, because fox and grain cannot do any harm to any other.
The outcome of this whole conceptualization process then now you can write an exact problem statement of exactly what you're going to do and how and a detailed form, okay , that you're going to have this knowledge structure where this this rule is fired, you will get this and so on and so forth.
An algorithm is a set of unambiguous instructions that a mechanical computer can execute.
So, that is something is a component which is part of the goal state.
You cannot solve the problem in real time.
So that is one way and then it is quite possible that you take the entire sequence again.
What does this artificial neuron do?
It it what what the heuristic function take as an input?
All events can be added, all people not explicitly mentioned are possible to be added, all props involved are added and then the sequence of events, the default sequence of events are all added, Okay .
Let us begin with the description of progression.
You can see that his representation is almost the same as we have seen before.
The parent one, first element, first city is A and the mapping says A should be replaced by E.
Our brain somehow in brain also works that way.
Ideally the sample should contain everything that could be there, for example, if my signature is to be recognized and I I will have to actually try writing my signature twenty, thirty, forty, fifty times and hopefully it should cover all all different variations I I produce while I sign okay .
Again, you can see that the word ‘attack’ is not represented as collection of primitives.
From this five generate twenty, throw this five, out of this twenty again pick up up five, throw rest so and so forth.
Hopefully the summation will be less than zero now.
It says that the farmer is on the right hand side and at L Fx which is not says that fox and chicken cannot be there together on the left side and chicken and grain cannot be together on the left hand side.
Every level increases number of nodes exponentially and that’s the problem with this approach.
We have seen unguided search methods.
So, we no state will have number of missionaries other than three, number of cannibals other than three, okay .
For example, if you have one cannibal, you can send one missionary with it.
Another benefit of this technique is that its implementation is available in OpenCV 3.4.2 and OpenCV 4. 
We have already seen how specific and general move can be written.
Further development in tesseract has been sponsored by Google since 2006.
Okay , something which can which can lead to solution.Consider okay .
In first thing is called winding phase.
In fact, the conceptual roles does do you may not find that thing in in in the the statement sometimes but it is derived out of that.
So that's quite similar.
Propel means applying physical force to the object, okay .
Because remember, we have done something in the goal-state planning, we have learned that it is quite possible when you add a new task, you are testing for malaria, you may do something which fails the test of typhoid that you do earlier.
So, that always you need to have some optimum number of such components.
Technically, it is pretty simple.
But this is a basic primitive thing that you must understand.
You have to decide how knowledge base is going to process the queries of the users.
Look closely at this representation.
So, that is missing here.
So we’ll explore one .
The summation should be less than zero but it is going above zero.
Eight thousand is not all that large if you if you look at the complexity of chess.
okay but...and in some cases it is player one and player two as well.
6,2,0 is also a child of 3,2,3.
Besides classic overfitting, learners can also disappoint by learning the wrong lesson.
We have seen three different ways of doing it.
In most cases if if you look at those chess puzzles, you'll find W and B.
What he did, he wrote a an artificial intelligence program based on neural networks and when he could do it the advantage of that program is that could shortlist those five thousand resumes into just five hundred and expert’s work is reduced tenfold, okay .
That is precisely what we are trying to do now.
And we want to an estimate A, B, C, D, E, F, G. Now E, F, G, you just calculate that using the simple heuristic that I talked about, that table and find out.
But if if you can think of a clever idea, the presentation becomes much simpler.
So, I just provide those images as inputs to my neuron and those inputs and I pick up some random weights, the wei wei ...weights are multiplied with the inputs and the summation is generated.
So, that is a little better compared to the other one. C is as good as A because only one option, the top most row is possible for us to fill.
As I said, when if you stack up somewhere, the alternate path is going to be useful and the example that I'm going to talk about is called Speech translation problem.
It is also used in in satellites by ISRO scientist, because again over there, there is an issue about power as well as this thing , so they innovatively used this thing .
An interesting thing is if you look at the shape of both functions, if positively classified, correctly classified value, for example, for your friend, the output should be greater than zero and you get zero point one .
So, two conditions: A dot addition’s intersection GS must be a non -empty set and A dot deletion intersection GS must be an empty set.
Let us see.
Now, B becomes minus three though there is a a node which can guarantee a very good that thing , but opponent is not going to play that for us.
There are single-shot detection techniques like YOLO(you only look once) and region-based text detection techniques for text detection in the image.
Deep-learning based method performs better for the unstructured data.
Machine translation systems integrated into an online store are often used in the travel industry’s online services and the online trade of consumer products.
The place where I hang my keys is the other.
In real world as I said, were sent out to survive on their own, those who survive only will meet with the others and get better offspring.
So, the point is, this ant colony optimization method is based on these two simple parameters, whether the path is recent or whether this path is travelled by multiple agents.
And you can see that they are also named as max.
So and there is something called picture aiders which which talks about the attributes of the object.
In addition, the end result of post-editing can be used to train the machine translation engine to further improve its operation.
This is the only slide which contains those names, they are all not that important for us as right now, but if you're trying to dealt deeper into GA later, probably you need to learn more about them. okay .
Second, which are yet to be explored and the third which which we are considering right now, Okay .
The Transformers outperforms the Google Neural Machine Translation model in specific tasks.
so It's basically an alternate thing.
Guided Search Methods actually use heuristics where you can you can say that this move is better than the other , or some some estimate about how good or bad a particular move is. deep breath
There is no complexity here actually.
So, and sometimes an additional value is provided.
This is the time where I've reached when the reached to the leaf node. I have reached to the leaf node, apply static evolution function okay and then that value is returned back.
So that is represented as picture aiders in in CD .
toh longer paths lesser the pheromone.
I'll pick up that move.
But here that part is not important the part important here is bike.
So, it moves. The ownership is moved from Sachin to Sarfaraz okay .
It takes two things as input.
Albino for example, or having the heart on the right side or something like that.
Probably some of you may not be able to read and understand the third representation better than the second one.
So, that is the second thing and nothing else is possible if you opt for a draw okay .
For example, here you get a slanting line like this and this and a horizontal line, you can call it A, irrespective of which picture which pixel is it illuminates and which pixel it doesn't.
A good chess player would look at other things.
It's a pretty trivial using a vector.
Best first search is about exploring this but unlike hill climbing you will just pick up the best node.
So, there are some parts of the script we have already seen, the first one is entry conditions.
You can see that it is not part of the goal state in So, both conditions are satisfied.
Okay .
But then, such when you keep question marks, there are encounter later statements.
Okay , because action always applies in forward direction.
T is something that we use to control this probability.
Moving upon one step further or two step further and you have eight points.
So, we can’t do it and in in that case this heuristic is going to be quite useful.
We just state that for progression, it should the move the action should make the state more relevant for the final state and less for the start state, exactly opposite while you come back.
Will what we have seen in this particular module?
Parent node is explored again to get its next child.
We’ll be discussing about the back-propagation algorithm that we mentioned in the previous module.
So in there you don't have a children.
So, that that is possible.
I'm I’m segregating each one at L Fr.
For example, if you get a statement called ‘Jay went to watch a match and he was very happy’ you can conclude that he was happy because the exit condition says that if the team has won he is happy.
Okay .
Progression is relevant to our goal state if some part of the resultant state is in the goal state and removed part must not be in the goal state okay .
Okay , and the the rule number five also talks about statement that we’ve looked at in the previous module.
Think of representing a problem of rating an essay or rating a post using a state space and you learnt that it is not that easy.
Okay and the final state is everything on the right hand side so it says L not Fr, not fx, not ch, not grain.
So, that indicator you can see a a double arrow pointing, and you can see that it is pointing to conceptualization and not the act.
CD is another method of knowledge representation like Semantic net and other methods that we've seen so far.
So zero zero to three zero is impossible.
Okay Now what you do is basically you store this T value in three column table.
So you’ll have to try an alternate, Okay .
Okay . But in that, it believe me in fact, that’s what we are going to see that some typical types of moves are better than others, but we do not know that thing right now, and that’s why we'll we are using Unguided Search.
You have all four of them on one side and in the initial state, all four of them on the right side in the final state.
So, it is possible that you choose them you use something else to choose.
I'm talking about an average which belongs to that range.
So what is the outcome?
And knowledge engineer that knowledge and expert also learns a lot out of it.
So, there are some specific primitives, we’ll be looking at them basic building blocks, and those around those building blocks, the structures are generated and those structures are used to represent simplest things about the world.
The inputs are provided, outputs are generated and we correct those outputs by changing these weights.
Turing proposed changing the question from whether a machine was intelligent, to whether or not it is possible for machinery to show intelligent behaviour.
It it collects those big bunch of structures, match and that matching is done by something else.
So, that's what we write.
Like from four you can go to three also or two also or one also, but with some probability.
Roles, the people who are involved like person who wants to watch the match or booking clerk and security person who show you in and ticket checker who is there.
So far, we have said that we provide input, we we say that this is the right output, if the program generate a wrong output we convert that, we we change weights to make sure it generates the right output.
Because there are lot of people saying one thing, lot of other researchers saying absolutely the other, Okay .
So, this is the other rule and the last rule.

How can you represent cry?
Now you choose six but then there are no rules possible in this case.
Now try to understand what this mean.
For looking at that important characteristics of moving around in state space, we have taken one more rather two more examples here in this particular module.
Now, why have I used double arrows, because it is something I found that thing somewhere in Schank’s paper.
So, that is something that that mechanisms to store current state is very important.
How it is done?
Now, what is the state space?
Rating an essay or rating a post.
Because when number of missionaries become zero, you can have number of cannibals as two or three, no problem because they're not going to eat that missionary.
One is three four gallon water jug problem.
So, you need to look at the design which can provide all this.
okay , so that is there is no panacea.
Second one is very easy to understand.
‘Ran yesterday’ and ‘ran fast’, what's the difference?
So, that's why that arrow is is targeting the double arrow, okay between the actor and the act.
Now this is the value P and if our R which is which we have randomly picked up is less than P, then we allow.
Okay . Okay And I've already talked about sparse neighbourhood and dense neighbourhood and there is something called variable neighbourhood.
For example, I want to have C on D and I say that place on top CD I would like to execute that but the precondition says that the C and D both must be free.
I I cleverly defined the values of farmer, fox, chicken and grain.
But if you have two thousand cities or five thousand cities or e..e.. even one hundred cities, it is going to be impossible because the number of permutations and combinations are too much for you to actually do it.
So, this value describes weight of which layer, okay .
We will also see something called variable neighbourhood descent, which is again little different, which actually is better for solution search which which we have just seen last in the last module.
For example, Sachin’s elbow okay .
Those primitives are simple primitives and any language, any statement can be represented using that statement.
All four moves that I have all four moves says that it is N.
Now we are, when a node which is explored is already already explored before we’ll not explore it further for obvious reasons.
Now, let us look at syntactic rule number six.
Okay , so that's the that's the saving that you will have okay . Obviously you're paying the price but
In fact I I won't return with without doing a process.
Now, the second thing that we’ll have to once we have looked at those primitives, which can represent actions or verbs into those primitives.
Welcome back friends to the twelth module of AI in which we are going to talk about a few more search algorithms.
We will not be focusing on preprocessing step in this blog.
In that case, level number one is one, level number two is thirty five, level number three is thirty five into thirty five .
We must start with 4,8 and 9,2,7 and so and so forth.
Because chess is much more structured structured than many other cases, many other games, even table tennis.
So, that's the simplest type of planning.
Here also build solutions.
You have been to a place long back and you visiting again.
How the right reason from the statement can only be derived if you learn about Abdul’s plans and his goals and all that.
The first we have already seen.
Now, this is again an example of fuzzy logic like representation.
Now I want actually to find out path from A to again back to A considering all seven cities but the rest is not known to me.
So it is huge amount of time that is required.
For example, pick up a word called ‘Love’.
So, number of hidden units you need are twenty two.
Then you add total collective pheromone added by the ants in the current cycle so, that is delta tau T plus one.
DNA in turn contains genes, okay which basic building blocks.
Suppose, if I I’m here and I have five different moves from this I’ll apply this function to all of them.
Once you do that, all possible tours are provided to agents and they travel on all tours and they do change and all that eventually they’ll converge to the best path.
We have not used all those rules which we have defined.
The job of a hidden layer is is to identify features okay .
M plus C can be one, so one person can row the boat or M plus C can be two.
Okay the hidden unit total N inputs are provided.
This is something which we do everyday .
So, total summation is calculated the same way one upon one plus E raised to two minus some is calculated which you can see on the screen.
So, here it is different.
So, everything that is important is actually listed.
If you try, for example, try to find a node with a value, for example, if you’re exploring the search space containing all integers you'd like to find out an integer where the square of the integer and the cube of the integer is same and you continue exploring that, you’ll never get an end to it.
That way.
For example, one is PTRANS because the location of stone is changing.
So that pheromone value is based on the distance also.
That that's the point here.
Suppose if I'm I have a bunch of states say twenty different states I and I try to see if this sequence is good enough for me to get a solution.
If that parent cannot produce the next child then parent to parent is taken up.
For example, when viewing a map and looking for the shortest driving route from Denver to New York in the East, one can in most cases skip looking at any path through San Francisco or other areas far to the West; thus, an AI wielding a pathfinding algorithm like A* can avoid the combinatorial explosion that would ensue if every possible route had to be ponderously considered.
So, when I represent that statement, I say that Irfan this arrow and now this is not exactly like the previous arrow.
But then if you do that, you will find that it is phi.
You have no time to go back.
Okay C plus G is four again the same logic.
okay ,
If If you can combine both of them in your representation, that’s the best.
If I have my piece can move to a center where I have better control, I have an advantage.
Now that's a difficult question. And what should it do?
So, other side you cannot have that okay .
You may convert this representation a little better representation by looking at the context later.
so point is the only better spaces, only better individuals are likely to survive.
That ‘slash’ indicates this conceptualization is negated, means this thing did not happen.
Number of components as I said large number of companies is not very good.
Transfer to a human agent
One , very simple method is to use normal way of using binary neuron as a single digit.
Prototype construction begins with knowledge acquisition.
But then might not give you exact answer may not be optimal, may not be as in some cases may not give you even good answers.okay .
So, this is one thing which is indicated by rule number six.
Is a function which is is applied to a state.
The the algorithm, it begins with generate a random node from a state space.
It just does not depend on that time.
So, if you're sitting with an expert, you’ll have to learn all that because the rules are going to come in form of that jargon and you’ll have to convert that thing into the knowledge base.
But we assume that thing.
So, when I say that I want to I went to dine yesterday, the the whole bunch of information is provided.
okay.
So that there there are three ones listed on the slide, Okay .
You cannot.
So, that's the other addition.
In this case, we don’t do it.
So, when but it's basically a leaf node, okay though we say that we'll go out five plies depth.
So mutation is kind of a bad move
and not only that.
And why it is there?
Now, you may believe that it’s almost the same.
The example was of a predicate we’ll study about predicates later but when when I say L F FR L basically is an example of a predicate.
Okay , so there's one more thing as I said people from different domain use different words.
The bulletins and advertisements of a local competitor can be translated, as well as the content of local patents.
Here we begin to see one key property of the Transformer, which is that the word in each position flows through its own path in the encoder. 
And the first call of this algorithm will take the starting state.
They start travelling in random directions.
It changes the properties of the genes on the permanent basis.
The other method that we’ve seen is called best first search.
So once they are copied as it is, you have complete child A.
For a simple reason that would like to avoid unnecessary calculation of moves.
The difference is that the instrument is is helps this thing to occur, okay .
The Transformer was proposed in the paper Attention is All You Need.
Thank you.
If I explore it just one level in chess, I'll have to apply to thirty-five states.
Rajan wanted it.
Why it is called you can see why it is called square.
One of the benefits of this process is the delivery time – it is often shorter than with translation performed by a human translation from start to finish.
For example, when I say that X Ram shot Shyam, for example, now here when you represent that in CD , it it represents it in a way that Ram used some weapon which shot a bullet, which enters into Shyam’s body, so this thing is actually represented.
So, you can see that it is it is possible for somebody to conclude something like that, because it is provided here.
The earlier search methods that we’ve seen are called constructive search methods.
Because we are not sure what what is unravelling later.
You just say that current state is the start state.
So that kind of a thing will will happen with expert in this particular phase, okay .
Remember, you're not going to do this thing to the level that you conventionally do, in conventional that thing you almost right pseudocodes.
okay Nothing else is different, you can see that.
You can see that bounding boxes are mostly correct as they should be.
So I will have E here in child one at place number one, Okay .
We are not looking at anything else.
The opponent.
How static evaluation function gets its value?
If you negate it, you always have to apply one function maximizing and you will get the same answer.
Okay , we'll be looking at the rules which are used to represent different shades, different types of statements.
Okay , we’re only taking a small segment of this thing .
How you combine two strings?
Okay so what does that mean?
Now, an important something little different which little different than the conventional State-space search that we’ve seen so far.
I've not written how to move around in state space, how you choose value of variables and all that like A B C D is are the variables that we've used.
How bike and that PTRANS is related okay , PROPEL, sorry is related.
Okay with a third case for first two human reader can easily get Okay , how to get that thing in in the program computer program is a hard job.
Why chess is solved?
One utilizes the fully convolutional network to directly produce word or text-line level prediction.
And now, let us talk about a few complex cases where these rules are combined into representing a statement. .
Mad is minus ten, ecstatic is plus ten, so on and all other things are in between.
The translated material only remains in the memory of the machine translation engine for a short time, and it is not used for any other purposes.
And again, we'll see a few examples of complex statements, how those complex statements can be represented using multiple primitives together okay .
You cannot apply any rule anytime.
It is not white and black, not only white and black, it's also the player, the player one and player two sometimes.
So, you take a square root of it is nearly twenty two.
Again let me repeat.
We have already seen in in a typical case of depth bound depth-first search where the depth is just one is called depth depth-first iterative deepening search.
So better thing is choose the function on demand.
Somebody is dead then it is called health equal to minus ten in CD .
So, it is A to Z that means twenty six, okay .
For example, throw is is a verb.
Okay , Not only that one, second point is that you share what you have learned.
For example, I say that there was a movie where Shahrukh Khan, Deepika was there, and that parsi actor also was there.
The text detection pipeline in this paper has excluded redundant and intermediate steps and only has two stages.
There are some important differences.
Okay , it's time.
Or the other example is that I that I've also listed in the handout is that we went to Osho’s eatery when we went to Mandvi, and we enjoyed our dinner there.
Okay . Our next one is called Depth first iterative deepening.
A, we have started with A, now we reach to A and the cycle appears okay We'll stop this process and copy the rest of the elements as it is, so so A, okay the cycle.
We get three and two.
Say, cannot move.
The selection process only chooses better candidates based on the fitness value. okay .
Or generate, from this solution state you generate other solution states and find out which one is better and then you move there,
We’ll also look at two other methods of search called branch and bound and refinement search in in this particular module.
So the complete scenario is is is assumed once I state that.
So pick up the first city at random and solution city is that city, then pick up the nearest neighbour of that at that, there is no neighbour exists then return with the solution list, so that that means all the cities are explored and so on, okay .
It allows a bad move with some probability.
Okay So, that is a very typical problem that I've taken.
In the twenty-first century, AI techniques have experienced a resurgence following concurrent advances in computer power, large amounts of data, and theoretical understanding; and AI techniques have become an essential part of the technology industry, helping to solve many challenging problems in computer science, software engineering and operations research.
Because, you're going there, now you stop and now you're returning back.
I’m I won’t name Boman but I just say that there was a parsi actor, and you would immediately come back and tell me it was Dilwale, how did you do that, no sorry, it is Happy New year.
If you get a solution, that solution is optimum, not only that the advantage you don’t need to have the amount of memory that you’ll have that you’ll require in BFS.
What we do is we just write some sequence of random states, Okay and call that thing as node one.
Okay .
Next action, third action, fourth action.
So that's zero. So X zero Y plus Z .
For example, you have a color of skin which which is not inherited from either parents.
You may take up some other course on object oriented programming to understand what is the usefulness and importance of it.
why I've got this much of salary?
It's called positional value.
Story
And and again, I will say that only two consecutive states.
There are several techniques for recognizing the text.
Okay .
I’m trying for a state, my my pockets is one state.
Now I will trim anything which is less than twenty-two because I already have a solution which can provide me twenty-two.
In case of twenty six cities, twenty five factorial by two total number of alternatives are possible that comes out to be something I can't even read,
Something which is not there in the start state but in the end state should be added and actions should do this okay .
What do I mean by strong is that it it clears…it provides very, very clear meaning to our representation.
So that that sometimes it chooses a non-optimal path as well and that helped it come out of that local minima or maxima issue, like the simulated annealing okay .
What we want is we want much larger value, the summation should be beyond , it should be far from zero in a way that later on if some weights are reduced it will still be more, so it will still be able to recognize that image of your friend.
So, this is one example.
deep breath And now what we want to have is only four gallons of milk in that particular jug.
Either children list is emty, there is no children okay what could be the case?
The first one is a discrete function, you can see that the second one is not discrete, it is continuous.
It is not going to allow us to win.
If the AI is programmed for reinforcement learning, goals can be implicitly induced by rewarding some types of behavior or punishing others.
You can look at this example.
Object case relationship and the Sachin and and ATRANS that relationship double arrow - P.
When path one is little shorter the ant from E will reach faster over that line and when more ants will be travelling on that line, number of trips that probably because of we assume that equal number of ants coming from both directions, you can see that the path one you will have more number of ants travelling and more frequently.
’ Now, that is used as an instrument for the other conceptualizations to take place.
But goal stack planning is basically this - inserting components in in a stack and one after the other continue solving them.
With that we’ll conclude this particular module.
There's no way you can judge when you cannot judge they are called fleeting scripts and the the programmers solution to this problem is you just keep a pointer.
It is not very good.
Otherwise, you can just forget, it is better.
Obviously the knowledge base processing comes next.
Though it it sounds a wasteful at the first sight where you’re exploring the tree again, it saves on memory as well as if we’re using heuristics with it, it is possible to choose better moves in the next cycle.
What about fox, chicken and grain all three of them on one side?
Two choices and if I play B, I'm guaranteed to get minus three okay? .
Y is the amount of milk in five gallon jug.
And it in fact, for that what you're supposed to do is to derive meaning out of that statement, okay .
Even while they are they are grazing they they they keep on hearing the sound and looking it around to make sure that there are no carnivorous animals around
Okay So that is the essence.
And we have seen that is quite good.
There are in in other words there are three layers of inputs but two layers of weights.
In some cases, the search space is not finite.
So none of them is a solution but we cannot go.
And there is an example shown in the next slide.
But if if you try depth bound search and if if if there is a password, which is of four character or five character and if you’re if you're just exploring probably you’ll be able to crack it better, because it takes otherwise it takes much more time.
If you look from the angle of a programmer, this requires a lot of memory and you don’t really know how many nodes are going to be explored.
The last but one level where which level it is?
Bot: What’s your name?
Computer science defines AI research as the study of intelligent agents: any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of successfully achieving its goals.
Anyway, these are not all are important things, just to make sure you understand what we are talking about.
So, that's the problem.
So for everyone you are actually calculating.
There is no In fact, there is no input unit, there is no hidden unit, there there is nothing which you you it is called single layer perceptron.
Twenty-six.
Otherwise if you write the algorithm differently, the iterative way, is going to be very tough.
Dependencies also are possible to be modified using some small indicators.
Cloning is helpful when you need to build a more complex chatbot story but you don’t want to start it from scratch.
And if it is four four plies one four four zero zero zero in case of twenty, seven seven one seven five zero in case of thirty five for five plies you can see is going way beyond .
The case number three I’m I’m is also good.
You've seen problems with the scripts, we have seen aa fleeting scripts, we have seen how appropriate scripts can improve your reasoning. We have also seen some latest aa im improvements in this representation.
Props are the objects involved in the script.
Because it as salesman will have to come back to that city.
So, this also is a valid state.
Okay .
Information characteristics what is also very important because you are going to design your class based on that, okay .
So that's an example of an an invalid move.
So, this is a relevant regression.
But the other one when you apply the second rule, the state that we get has value two so we move to two.
So, that is called complete network.
Answer is MBUILD ING something, in a response to a question and you again after that once that is done, you also use MTRANS from that mind to the mouth, Okay , so that that is done in fact, answer is represented like that, Okay .
We have seen that.
And probably you can also conclude that Jay is not all that great cricket lover like other Indians.
So, if you if you do it for a very large time, you probably run out of time.
Companies have a broad and diverse range of translation needs.
In this case eighty-one input units because it is a nine into nine matrix.
Three sixty different for a small problem like this only seven cities there are total three sixty tours possible.
A chat widget is a ready-to-use, customizable chat window that is added to a website.
We have looked at some guided, two methods actually, hill climbing and Breadth First Search in in earlier module.
In case number one we have zero zero, both jugs are empty.
Here we allow with a probability P.
B and C is exchange, D and C is exchange, E and D is exchange, F and E is exchange and F G and F is exchange.
So it begins with null.
As machines become increasingly capable, tasks considered to require intelligence are often removed from the definition of AI, a phenomenon known as the AI effect.
So, there are some issues with CD and next module we’ll be talking about an extension which Schank himself proposed called scripts which which which actually removes one of the problems with CD but then there are other problems.
The same way, every middle unit is connected to every output unit and if it has more than one layer, the same thing is applied.
There is nothing which describes the fox to be farmer to be on one side or the other.
Now this is comparatively much more readable .
Twelve million rules! Think of it.
Unlike that we can't pour milk out of the jug.
Support planning comes next.
Okay , and usually when you write a game playing program, play around with game playing program very often that function is known as move Move generator.
It’s not going to help me much.
This is again an example where back propagation algorithm is used.
In some cases it is not possible.
There are some components which are there in state space, the initial state space there, are some components in the final state space.
In fact, if you see the handout, I I have a complete table talking about each rule one after the other.
Toh , these are the differences; on A table and on B; this is what we want to achieve.
Okay So, there is a unit one which learns to be active when the line one slanting line from going up from left to right okay .
Now, this is an important advantage of escaping from local minima.
I’ll not reach to solution after this, Okay .
The capacity of the X is eight.
So that is called generate offspring from random current of this thing .
What what does that mean ? That you shouldn’t have cycles that you should be moving further.
And there are two type of methods, guided and unguided.
The relationship between human translators and machine translation systems has been that the machine translation engine has been trained with translations created by human translators.
While watching match, I ate ice cream.
There is a reason.
So, you need to group rank and order your knowledge, you need to find out missing points in that knowledge, you you will have to remove redundant and unnecessary part from the knowledge.
Solution is about moving across state space.
That means that now we have M one minus M missionaries on left side, C one minus C missionaries on the left hand side, that must fulfill this condition.
There are many other methods.
How you assume?
CD does not provide you that context.
Single conceptual entity represents the event.
And again the theory says that it is possible to to use a single hidden layer and a single hidden layer can do a job which multiple hidden layers can do.
Knowledge engineer will decide the database structure and the knowledge structure and probably XML structure and all that but he is also not go to code.
Okay , so that's the point here.
Now, we have already seen that this is something which we’d like to avoid.
So, These are shown on the slide.
Now how you that threatened, you can see that there is no statement like that, no indication of threat but it can still do it.
The problem of hill climbing is that you end up in a local maxima.
Now, that's the heuristic.
okay , So, and you can see that bullet and all that is already there.
Now, once you have that information, you can understand that he probably has flown from Mumbai to LA, so that Mumbai the the earlier representation, the the starting point is a question mark and when the next statement is encountered, the starting point becomes Mumbai, so that's something which CD can do, in fact and that question mark, you can see is is an example of a conceptual tense. There is…for example you if you encounter a statement, if you drive rash, there is more chances of meeting with an accident.
So, these are the things which is are very important in in CD .
With that we’ll conclude.
If a an opponent has two consecutive cells occupied and the third cell is empty, is a very less value almost defeat okay .
Okay , so when you use this variable neighbourhood descent and why it is called descent, please understand.
The the different components which you want to solve and for every component it adds an action and once the complete stack is done, we’ll run that thing and see if it gets the goal and it is very, very important because it is quite possible that an action might have a side effect which undo what some other action previously done action is done, okay .
Anyway, so let us Okay . The second thing, when a rule is applied , there is something which should change the state. The current state is X.
We don't really know . Right now, we don't really know.
So, that is one important thing that happens here.
Now, seriously ill is minus nine and so on and so forth.
You can see that some part from parent one, some part from parent two.
There's one example shown on the screen A is resting on B, B is resting on C, C is resting on D.
One more important thing here is called Mutation which we are not going to apply in our we are not going to discuss further in this module.
We’ve cheated actually and just instructed the program to choose rule number one .
Maybe farmer.
So, what Purochan is trying to do?
The complexity lies in the moves.
Farmer or not farmer?
Region-based approach work in two steps.
This is the the representation.
It is it is like this, okay it is basically a discrete function, for all negative values it is zero , for all positive values it is plus one.
Now MTRANS is is quite important here for example, a verb called reading is what?
Like if I want to change this ‘attack’ to to primitives, I need to again make it more complicated which I do not want to do.
If you have that domain knowledge here you can say which move is better than the other, is called heuristic.
So, what you do is as an HR manager, you would like to have to strategies designed and defined to make sure that they have more tendency to retain in the organization.
Unfortunately, I cannot use my queen to capture the knight because my own piece is sitting in between.
In fact, in some cases the mapping is is you will have to cycle that mapping in fact if you map the first element is already occurred then you you have to again map, so it is sometimes in some cases it is pretty complex but we have we taken a very, very simple case here to just make you understand how partially mapped crossover works.
Now the other string contains something A, D, E, F and now it has some cities which are already occurring here.
So, again out of that five you pick up first five and so on.
The neurons don’t remain their steady living, they they are constantly dying.
Is it part of the start state?
Now, Sita was happy because of that, okay .
So, we find out objective function value of a new state minus the objective function value of the current state.
We find out the fitness function value.
Now we assume that this is an end, we’ll not go further.
The study of mathematical logic led directly to Alan Turing's theory of computation, which suggested that a machine, by shuffling symbols as simple as 0 and 1, could simulate any conceivable act of mathematical deduction.
And we are not actually showing how the variables are manipulated.
It generates optimal paths again when there is an obstacle placed and there are three good things about it.
So what we have the best node on the top.
These vectors are created by multiplying the embedding by three matrices that we trained during the training process.
So, we'll be talking about that.
We are not going to discuss many things about GA and I have I have given one or two references at the end of this chapter and end of this module.
Test planning, we know the experts are invited and experts are given job of writing test cases and test the system elaborately.
Here, machine translation helps customers with their purchase decisions.
And sometimes you need to have more number of epochs, depending on the complexities of the images that you provide.
Remember we have looked at Tic Tac Toe problem last module and we have labeled some of the states as W,L and then we have also had draw, okay .
We have already seen that even classified, correctly classified inputs are also learning, in case of sigmoid.
The actual distance is obviously more than what we are assuming here.
For example, in a case of chess, branching factor is huge thirty-five.
It is also possible to indicate that there is a transition, there is something which is happening and here it it gets concluded, Okay .
There is something called dead end also.
One slanting line , one with the this one's slanting and the other one is on the other slanting and the third one is the horizontal left to right up, left to right down and horizontal.
If I apply to two, thirty-five into thirty-five states.
Now it has two arguments X and Y.
But then if you if you bond.
Many tools are used in AI, including versions of search and mathematical optimization, artificial neural networks, and methods based on statistics, probability and economics.
It can be even more complicated.
We have M one missionary C one missionaries on the left side, M two missionaries and C two cannibals on the right side and either boat is on the left side or right side.
The There is some similarity.
Deep Blue became the first computer chess-playing system to beat a reigning world chess champion, Garry Kasparov, on 11 May 1997.
Maximum values of missionary and cannibal can be two.
Every unit learns to pick up this feature and learn to become active.
For most of its history, AI research has been divided into sub-fields that often fail to communicate with each other.
The rest is an estimate, okay .
Greeting
Three cases are shown on the screen okay .
So, that is very good actually.
That's the reason why I would like to explore the search tree as deep as possible.
There are many similar things.
L Fr fx ch and Gr - farmer, fox, chicken and grain, all four of them on the left hand side.
In fact, our solution you probably have seen that a few places we are just pouring the water out of the jug because water is inexpensive which is not there stated in the problem itself.
Okay , sometimes you you will want to specify the time, for example, Milkha Singh ran yesterday, then that arrow will have that information, so that is sometimes called T, T represent time and there are some action aiders, for example, when you say Milkha Singh ran yesterday, that yesterday is called action aider.
And remember, in our previous example that we took, M value is twenty-two.
So chicken is taken back, and then you pick up grain and take it on the other side.
Thank you.
Now, this is a very simple function, it outputs zero or one based on the total summation of wi xi.
Not only highest it is more than the collective value of everybody else.
But please understand that this is not the limitation of CD .
Bot: What type of coffee would you like to have?
We meet people and decide this is a good person and this is a bad person, this is not so nice person and so on and so forth.
Okay , For example, we can’t move from zero zero to one zero in case number one because how will you get one zero? There is no measuring device available . You can't get that, Okay .
You have seen that AI is possible to be solved the problems of AI are possible to be solved using a method called State Space, where we can define the these problem states in in a State Space.
What should it be?
We’re stuck, we cannot move forward and we’re not at the solution.
H While C has three children, H is seven, I is minus nine and J is five.
If you don’t have from this particular state there are no rules possible you can’t go further is a dead end.
There is some dynamic issue in the path.
okay .
I do not want to discuss more about why it is part of AI and why it is not.
What is the difference?
That's the idea of CD .
That means, it has complete connections.
One more line, one more hidden unit learn to become active and it is it is right it’s it’s it’s going down from right to left to right.
Is a is a separate discipline today.
There are a few other things.
In phase number one let them reach to the final this thing the city and calculate the distance, the length.
Neuron is very tiny thing and it uses electrochemical reactions, okay , the the signaling process to send and receive.
And on the right hand side you have tilde Fr means not Fr, farmer is not, okay .
So you can see how it works here.
It tries all possible way to explore the search surface and get the the solution.
In in the previous modules, we have seen how can one define a State Space, how can one define and so and so forth.
So we have a table which actually summaries summarizes all the primitives and their work.
We are we are going to learn about how CD representation can be actually used to convert a statement into that representation.
okay , when you talk about a soldier fit, does not and fit when you say plus eight, he is really fit.
First thing - It is possible to have multiple representations for the same problem.
If it is not what you have to do is to select some out of the complete set.
The order crossover is very similar to the earlier one but the other thing that we are going to keep the order intact. Okay .
It looks at the input and tries to figure out the the chemical compound structure.
So, this this Axon is basically an output device.
We are only going to talk about legal moves right now and not complicate the matter for writing moves for winning.
Remember why it is the decrement because you are picking up a worst state.
And later stage you don't.
The other one which is also quite interesting is that we we always pick up the best node irrespective of the parent value.
If the node is a goal node, it quits.
There is an action, there is an actor, there is an object and so on so forth.
Now that is little different function.
I have already discussed them.
We have X zero to XN as an input.
Do you need an additional expert for it?
Basically, the goal state will give you action.
So, it is possible to have multiple initial and final states.
It is two way dependency.
The first node is minus five, not very good.
In the initial run, you may use sparse neighbourhood to grow faster.
That's the previous level.
We just assume it to be there existing.
So, I I followed a a typical order that suits my this thing .
So,and and if I get one as thirty-four the other one is twenty-two my lower amount reduces to twenty-two.
Now here is precisely what I'm doing.
Thought-capable artificial beings appeared as storytelling devices in antiquity, and have been common in fiction, as in Mary Shelley's Frankenstein or Karel Čapek's R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots).
What does it do?
Now there is a cause effect relationship.
Now that adds dynamism to this calculation of SEF .
The direction towards LA from where we don't really know but it says that Sachin PTRANS himself in the direction of LA from somewhere okay .
Not all place you will find exactly the rules to be the same.
If I have to search the key in entire house, it is useless .
So, even if the prototype is discarded, there is still something positive and very, very important point is that even when you develop a prototype, simplest of prototypes or very, very complex prototype, the most important thing that you encourage people to feedback give feedback and give their suggestion because it's very, very easy to change the prototype is extremely hard to change the final product, okay .
And then again you let them meet and generate twenty in the next iteration, I have already talked about.
So, point is the roles even viewing a match role would change, Okay .
Now whether rules are properly executed, whether you need to reschedule the order of the rule, whether you need to fine tune those rules, that also is to be properly properly done.
But that will be tested in this case.
Variable neighbourhood descent is little different type of an algorithm.
Placing it there on the in B it is good because I I can have two possible options, the last column and the diagonal line.
okay , Such things, when do you do?
However, a reader with basic language skills can understand what the intended meaning of the text is.
So, that's why you can see that that relation is shown between fast and PTRANS .
So the the programmer program itself can reason from it.
The solution space ready, and you initialize the solution using a very simple thing.
So that's that's the idea of branch and bound which is pretty simple.
Similarly, when you have negative misclassification it is the images of your friend and it is not saying yes, then we will have to increase the amount of summation and again, anything multiplied by zero is not contributing, so will only increase .
This enables even young children to easily make inferences like If I roll this pen off a table, it will fall on the floor.
Solution space are space, exploration is little complex.
Now here again unlike the other case, where we call it heuristic function this is called objective function.
Where M one greater than or equal to C one.
What's the second one?
And it is quite fault tolerant.
So what you do is you use a C, they they are being used okay .
Okay , we have already seen in in this particular module, we have seen two problems, trivial problems .
How do you know that this is a valid state?
Now, there is something different.
So, A or E one of them must be zero because farmer will use one .
So, a person also involved from that angle.
I’ll have to learn what are false positives, what are false negatives, we’ll have to learn them.
Usually, there is an alpha release as well which is circulated the company only and people who are using that product in the company will come back and give you their feedback.
There are four components in the start state four components in the goal state but then two of them C on top of D and D on top of table is already achieved in the final state.
It is possible to generalize, in fact this method is good enough for us to generalize.
Now, and this these two conceptualizations have some relationship.
And again, whenever appropriate script is invoked it can predict things which which are not mentioned.
And there is one more thing.
Usually, the most important thing for the reader is to understand the essential content of the review; it does not matter if the machine translation engine occasionally makes some silly mistakes or formulates sentences in a clumsy way.
One is winning.
The primary job the the job of an ant is to find the food source, nothing else.
There are basically two different types of search methods.
So, this expert system, while you’re designing knowledge representation process, you are not going to store the knowledge in different forms, please understand.
They pick up something else and test and so and so forth, and that's called generate and test.
And they are called conceptual categories, this PP picture producer, PA picture aiders and ACT and location and time and all that together are called conceptual categories.
It says , and we are only using a three integer vector value X, Y and Z.
Okay , the method itself is called Crossover.
So if you if you’ve used verb like pick pick up, hold and all that, if you want to represent them using CD , you will use GRASP as as the the primitive.
You will try to actually explore more number of nodes.
There is somebody who is going to code this thing in Java or C++ or Python or something.
It returns NodeInfo.
If you want to write a general purpose chess player, it would be very difficult because here the search strategies and heuristic functions are specifically designed to address this guy, Gary Kasparov.
Now they are explicitly mentioned.
And the value, the heuristic value that that path that move enable says how good or bad that thing is.
Now look at the four prerequisites again .
It was designed to make sure that Gary’s this thing the moves can be thwarted.
Next, we’ll switch up the example to a shorter sentence and we’ll look at what happens in each sub-layer of the encoder.
And again, 0,5,3 we have 2,3,3 and 3,5,0 which is again repeated.
So, I'm not here to discuss object oriented programming.
The AI field draws upon computer science, information engineering, mathematics, psychology, linguistics, philosophy, and many other fields.
You may not repeat, but if you do if you are not repeating what you are supposed to do is to remember the entire tree.
So, goal stack planning is one method of planning.
And validation normally is done by the designing expert.
API is the acronym for application programming interface.
Thank you!
This state actually converts the formalized content into the code that is the minimum thing that you do in this phase and it’s very cruc…crucial part is KE and developer communication.
Okay .
I just got these four values, their path; path is not very important, but then value is very important, because based on this value I'll decide which path to choose , which move to choose. okay .
Right set of motivational strategies for employees.
So we are not discussing the rest of them.
In fact the vertical line that you see from zero to one is is not actually indicating any input, it is just shown to make sure that you it looks like square.
Okay and when I want to when I went to watch a match, obviously, I'm interested in viewing a match and I have that money, kind of Okay .
It will pick up random parents and generate that thing , it combine them okay .
The sigmoid function you can see is, is S shaped.
deep breath We have used variables like X, Y and Z .
They can be nuanced, such as X% of families have geographically separate species with color variants, so there is a Y% chance that undiscovered black swans exist.
We explore the top when we get all nodes, we apply heuristic values to them, add them in the array and again pick up that node from the top.
Try to understand.
There are two modes of transcription, namely the lexicon-free and lexicon-based transcription.
And other stakeholders are also invited, because you're not going to code.
Okay and this is a small thing contribute to larger structure, that’s the great thing about CD .
So, there are alternate paths also and there are alternate execution of the sequences of these scenes also and so on so forth.
So that's what this first representation do.
So it will have higher heuristic value based on this information okay .
Now, I I want in in the final state C is on the table.
I missed what you said.
An AI's intended utility function (or goal) can be simple (1 if the AI wins a game of Go, 0 otherwise) or complex (Perform actions mathematically similar to ones that succeeded in the past).
If it you are not going to remember it for a long period.
Fingerprint recognition probably is is something that you have seen quite a lot in recent days.
There are many paths D to E, D to F then G and E and so on there are many paths which we are not going to look at those paths.
When we say we dined there that we we went into that, we we have looked at the menu, we ordered something, we ate those things. And there are waiters who who who who delivers those things to us, serve those things to us and we paid the bills obviously and then left.
These four main approaches can overlap with each other and with evolutionary systems; for example, neural nets can learn to make inferences, to generalize, and to make analogies.
Okay that causal relationship because this thing has causal relationship, you can conclude something which was not explicitly mentioned in the the statement, okay .
So, I have twenty six in in that case I need outputs, total twenty six outputs.
One is the name of restaurant and the other is paying when you are paying it is assumed that he has followed the normal path.
You may test it, Okay .
I’ll try exploring all possible cases until I get one.
The goal is to share information within the entire organization so that as many employees as possible have access to the best information that supports for their work.
Milkha Singh ran fast.
So, he the translator is converting that Hindi sentence into a french sentence.
Conceptual roles are are also very important.
It is not applied elsewhere.
and that is there in fact it is it is part of the script.
So, for placing suppose if my queen is under attack somewhere and I have two possible moves, I can save my queen one, I can place this pawn one step further at this position.
So, how it is done that X is inserted on the stack, Y is inserted on the stack, Z is inserted on the stack and you solve Z first then Y f then and then X or you insert Z Y X and then solve it that way and so on so forth.
so you you change things in a way when you you have two strings, two parents when they meet, you you do not get a string with similar characteristic,
So we would like to explore and try to figure out what how good a particular move is and go further we are more sure.
So, this is very, very important.
So, this two headers are in possible to be used here and the automated cook can actually decide that Jay does not require the dinner now.
And second , sometimes when you don't have heuristic, but the problem domain is small enough, you can go for Unguided Search Methods as well .
And looking at the later statement, if it is found that he has really went go went to watch the match, you can insert those things later and not not right now.
But then why we use word static evaluation function?
And the reuse reusability idea was also built in.
Okay last three requirements.
So that's something that the system has to do when it’s working with scripts like this, Okay .
In fact, every level you will be exploring one node for more than every the total number of nodes that you’ve explored even in the case where you have a binary tree.
K also can be there in the beginning, okay .
Well the last one, last city is always the first city.
Because as I said if you execute everything, remove all difference, it is quite possible due to side effect some other differences are not executed. So, once again you look at that goal.
We have seen how scripts are used in representing statements which represent complete scenarios and not a single statement here.
For urgent situations, an immediate translation can be ordered through the portal.
We are moving back, we're talking about moving back, but basically, we are going to solve the problem in a forward direction only .
A MiniMax algorithm works like that and we are going to look at the algorithm the very algorithm in this particular module.
So, it is it is something which says that one single hidden layer is is is suffice, is good enough for solving any problem.
Okay .
So you have to choose that precondition accordingly.
I I'll cut them at the same place, I I pick up this part and paste it here, pick up the first string path and paste it here. Okay .
No, sometimes it is not.
You can't you should not be going beyond that limit and we'll be discussing about that soon.
So, that’s one example.
Take huge amount of time if I use a lot of components that demands SEF to be optimal.
That’s the problem.
What are the essential ingredients?
And calculate the value P which is probability one plus E raised to minus delta E upon T.
Let us see what that is.
So I'm attending my eyes to the match, Okay .
So, what we have to do is wherever the xi is non-zero, one, we have to change the value of w. We have to reduce that value because we want to reduce the amount of summation.
That’s why this is called unsupervised learning which is also quite quite important, and many a times this unsupervised learning is as a as a process pre-process for the supervised learning.
X one into W one one one.
So, that final meaning is lost, okay .
Whether the other experts are invited for additional components that you would like to add or not.
So, what you need to do is to travel in N dimensional space from the randoms point that you start with to the goal state.
In the beginning they travel at the constant speed and they spray pheromone along the path.
And that's the fact.
We have looked at two trivial problems in the previous module.
Call is made when you reach to the final this thing and then unwinding phase starts.
There are lot of things here that you need to know.
DFS may not get you an optimal solution.
So, when it is represented in in CD , all other statements are added all these objects which are implicitly mentioned are added.
How the this ants find the food source and then retain that?
In fact, I've just given you an idea about this.
After a while they realize, oh, we are doing this.
How you decide that this process is malicious?
Is it valid?
We’re also seeing it that it is possible to apply a little different type of a search called solution search where every node in this search space represents a solution.
W and N you choose W and so on so forth.
So, everybody is roped in now and we have a bigger team in this particular phase.
A TensorFlow implementation of it is available as a part of the Tensor2Tensor package.
I'm I do not have any copy right now I do not have anything to begin with.
The third thing which I would like to talk about is I I use typical arrows, typical type of links which suits…which I found from those papers.
You have multiple neighbours, multiple solutions possible.
So the project planning is done in a way that whenever the expert is available, you should execute things where you need him, okay .
For example, if the only farmer can row the boat and when the farmer is around nothing wrong is going to happen.
So, that ‘with a friend’ is represented like this.
So, this is something which is about prerequisite.
You can see that the first line say x one, w one k, x two w two k.
So both ways it is possible.
Okay So that is fine.
The same way, there are ants coming back from E, okay , because F is a food source.
So, this expert and CPM will will tell you such type of charts, will tell you exactly what if one task is delayed, okay , what if a task gets delayed, whether the next task will be delayed if it is a prerequisite.
Begins with zero but then it'll increment every time. So, when you get back you know where I am okay so if somebody is already told us that after a sufficient depth you'll have to come back maybe a terminating criteria.
We will continue picking up nearest cities and eventually we will get the the the complete list of cities.
If you have arranged them in some other fashion and only other fashion possible is on BA before and on A table next, like this the other case.
But then a diligent reader would ask a question; how do the system learn that Epicurean is a restaurant?
That also is perfectly valid because that also is acceptable acceptable in literature.
Why when you do when you go for dense neighbourhood okay why We have already seen why sparse neighbourhood.
Sentiment analysis is a subfield of computer science that uses NLP and machine learning to measure the sentiment and tone of text or spoken language.
Everything on the right hand side.
I'll have to back the values up.
How can you represent the sorrow?
We have looked at back propagation algorithm and this is all the this is prerequisite to back propagation algorithm.
For example, to your CRM or email marketing software and the other way around.
For goal director reasoning it is the opposite.
We again do not have any measuring device with us.
Number of missionaries are more than number of cannibals is not allowed.
Sometimes people call it only a refinement .
And remember this is a past tense.
In fact, branch and bound can be combined with any search algorithm, even we have taken the case of finding the shortest route between two cities.
Row is the constant rate by which it is decremented.
For in fact multiple verbs can be represented using the same primitive, for example, give Sachin gave his bat to Sarfaraz will have ATRANS , okay , as as a primitive.
So, that’s something quite similar to GA is happening.
Why?
Scientists have not yet found a way to sync those processors in in a seamless way.
L M one C one and R M two C two and B L what does that mean?
That is little confusing, but sometimes it is possible.
At the same time, Japan's fifth generation computer project inspired the U.S and British governments to restore funding for academic research.
A more elaborate definition characterizes AI as a system's ability to correctly interpret external data, to learn from such data, and to use those learnings to achieve specific goals and tasks through flexible adaptation.
We’ve seen the earlier cases, the repeated nodes and and the nodes which are already explored.
We are not going to discuss all of them.
Toh , With that note, would like to conclude this module.
So, this is an example of a relevant progression.
Okay , so conceptual tenses past is P, future is F, negation is slash start of a trans transition is TS Okay .
Great!
But the, here there is one more word which I'll have to use.
The problem state.
Then we have two options.
Then you can place on top BA and then you get on BA.
The fourth step is collection of nodes and whatever we have discussed and we have also studied how we decide the best value and why that best value is good.
We have seen how you can use a a vector.
King is under attack but queen cannot help.
For example, the names of products and services you offer.
For missionary cannibal reconstructive search method is a little better because it’s easier.
So, we call them equation ten point one and ten point two which are which indicates the output generated for both of them.
Thank you
And you will have to do it again, second epoch, third epoch.
And this is something which is there in humans as well.
So that path will no longer, not look attractive if the ant has not found the food source.
Okay .
So here the location is also possible to be represented not only time the location can also be represented.
Now you may be surprised why you are doing that.
Now this is very similar to what we have seen before.
Okay so that that is something which is which is very common and seeing across all life forms.
Which out of which this two which one is relevant?
It is impossible because everything is happening in real time.
Okay , so state space in that case is pretty complex.
So the child one remember, is going to pick up the part from parent two so B, G, A parent two, middle part is copied into child one.
And we have also seen how one can assign values to those variables and so on so forth to make sure that you you start from initial state and reach to the final state, applying various preconditions, checking various preconditions and make sure that the rule applied in a valid manner.
A statement, for example, Ram loves Sita or Ram found Sita loving or or or something like that.
But obviously, this is different.
Now in this State-space what we do is every node represents a particular solution, a potential solution.
Remember , we discussed about plausible move generator in the previous module.
We'll have to do something.
It will shortlist five hundred out of that.
In fact, one was about death of a very successful horse race horse without any apparent disease and and a spouse killing the other one because of insurance money.
Unlike the conventional system, this is a major difference here.
what are the classes involved?
There is something called state and I've talked about that state a little earlier, when you said that health equal to minus ten, you're talking about state of a variable, state of something which is between minus ten to ten.
The other example, ‘terrorists shot hostage’.
The next one D you can see that it is replaced G, D is the mapping.
However silly it looks like that's our that's the way we do it.
But when you say that Sarfaraz took the bat from Sachin, you can see that the statement representation does not remain the same ap the rest of that is absolutely the same but you can see that the actor changes from Sachin to Sarfaraz.
You may not be able to solve in one using one combination, you may be able to solve using other combination that also is possible sometimes.
It It fails there and in case of best first search we don’t do it.
Tau is the value of pheromone equal to T T tau T the earlier one multiplied by one minus rho okay .
So experts will have to look at only five hundred resumes and out of which they may figure out that this fifty are good or hundred are good or hundred and twenty are good.
In in these trivial cases, we only need a two value vector and a three value vector, three integers only.
Based on that, there are some minute differences.
Again, the difference is to be removed; this is how it works.
We have looked at many other things in past, we talked about MiniMax layers, we talked about heuristic function which is called static evolution function, we've also seen that a game tree has expanded to the maximum possible level, static evolution function is applied at the leaf node, is backed up and based on which you'll decide the next node to choose.
So, the addition is this okay on CD.
You just travel first path record minimum, consider that as a minimum path, travel next path if it is more than minimum just terminate it from there and skip all branches and so on, okay and this branch and bound is great, if you have chosen somehow has some heuristic which can help you choose shorter paths before you'll be able to gain a lot out of this, okay .
For example, when you eat something, you’re taking a solid object from outside, ingesting it or drinking something which is liquid, which you're taking in.
how better how much they are, the quantitative representation, they'll not be able to give but here we’re thinking that way.
It says that A plus B plus C plus D not equal to six, twelve and four.
We apply first rule, we get minus five.
The GA is based on the principle that living how living forms continue to become better to to make sure that they they they adjust with the environment.
The time is one, the branching factor of the tree is one more.
Number of nodes from a given node, Okay and average number is higher.
Now D, so the corresponding element of D in parent two is H.
It is possible but it is not possible in this case,
If you are not very good in mathematics probably it looks little hard to understand but this is not so, please try to understand.
In fact, we have not stressed on one very critical aspect of state space called prerequisites.
Here you do one more thing.
Six two out of sixteen but there is a possibility that there is twenty and then you choose two.
Can you do that by computer?
We have one more state which is called a final state.
Let us look at the first three representation.
It lets chatbots understand the context and meaning of a user’s message and react to it properly, even if the user makes a spelling mistake.
But some of the alphabets are not recognized correctly.
So, that it’s very important that you also involve user into this process.
Compared with humans, existing AI lacks several features of human commonsense reasoning; most notably, humans have powerful mechanisms for reasoning about naïve physics such as space, time, and physical interactions.
Okay , so that is the next statement you can see which is is a three-prong structure which represents the state change, Ravan’s health is now minus ten.
Repeated or goal is not explored further.
Think of chess you will we’ll not be able to do that, but for these trivial cases you can actually do it.
So I'll start exploring the other route.
We'll look at the other problem called farmer fox chicken grain problem and precisely what we are trying to address here is is called multiple representation of the same problem.
So it's quite obvious.
Well, let us take the third rule.
Thank you.
So, again they choose from either upper part or the lower part of the and we assume that it is it is done with equal probability.
There is no ISA relationship.
Not only that Next to next also is empty.
The decoder has both those layers, but between them is an attention layer that helps the decoder focus on relevant parts of the input sentence (similar what attention does in seq2seq models).
Anyway, so there we are not using them, we are only using player one and player two here.
And if there is a problem with memory you cannot do that, so we’ll have to repeat that again.
There are three basic operations.
We pick up we describe an action called place on table which contains only one argument, place on table A will pick up the A cube and put it on the table a block A and put it on table.
How can I have it? Fine!
Okay , so I do not want to say that this is the list.
What does that mean?
That is not happening here.
And H appears at position the last but one in parent one, so it is copied there in the child one.
Now what is left?
So simulated annealing is is is a better method compared to hill climbing but anyway it is also a a superset of hill climbing.
For example, one simple method is to cut string at a typical place.
There may also be large quantities of various instructions, but translating them is not considered a viable option due to the cost.
okay ?
So the project is designed.
And that actually the search also has a pretty big disadvantage as well.
The fourth rule- We pick up an example of Sachin went to LA.
Pick up the start node and make it current.
A script is appropriate when script is really fitting in that statement and not always it is possible for us to judge and there are some examples provided in the handout.
But anyway, the final, once you do this, you'll have to test whether the plan is perfect or not.
So, there is no point invoking that script, there's something wrong, okay .
Okay , it's just the test nothing else.
Again let us see the same thing.
The first representation.
The transfer about something where the mind is involved.
In fact, best first search you have three different types of nodes.
But, the one which I'm talking about backpropagation neural network the BPNN which is the most used algorithm requires the network to be complete.
The second step in calculating self-attention is to calculate a score. 
How it is done?
In fact it is done, I I talked about friend, now I can talk about something similar called recognizing faces of employees of a company.
That is what we're going to study in this particular module.
When we get value ten.
EAST can detect text both in images and in the video.
okay number of missionaries, number of cannibals, great! they are they are still three.
Done.
But then nearest neighbor does not give you any guarantee for optimal solution.
In 2006, Tesseract was considered one of the most accurate open-source OCR engines then available.
For example, when you say that ‘Sachin gave his bat to Sarfaraz’ and when you say that ‘Sachin gifted his bat to Sarfaraz’, there is a difference between ‘give’ and ‘gift’.
You can see that it is there are some pixels which are on, there are pixels which are not on.
So, what is the solution?
okay , There are a lot of things which happen.
API
So, that also is very, very important role of a concept in CD .
We cannot have more, why?
But then, CD is not the panacea.
It begins with root node as a start node.
L and N again, he chooses L and N and D again, he chooses N, N and L, N and N and N and D and there's no win yet.
Okay
Along with concurrent discoveries in neurobiology, information theory and cybernetics, this led researchers to consider the possibility of building an electronic brain.
So, you have to because A is resting on top of B.
In that case I'll be able to figure out exactly which move is better and which move is not.
D is next, so we are copying next D here. Okay .
Now, every other person now is roped in the team gets bigger and everybody is told about the system, everybody gets the idea about the system and will be very clear about their own role in the system, okay .
Fr is on the left hand side at L Fx fox is on the left hand side, at L Ch, Ch is also on the left side.
that is better because the current architecture has multi core, is called multi core architecture where you have computers with multiple CPUs in in in real sense.
If we’re only picking up unexplored nodes what’s the point in storing explored nodes?
While while we read something, when we come across something that we don't understand, probably after reading few more passages, we’ll we’ll be able to get that thing right.
The exact same feed-forward network is independently applied to each position.
If it is the case , they are going to eat missionary and this is something which we do not want.
So, the the backing up value happens in the inverse order.
When you place X at the left top is not very good because I'm not going to achieve anything on that column it is possible to have on the right the top most row but it is not.
Before you have a recursive call you must provide your terminating criteria because when you make a recursive call it goes to the it it invokes one more instance and we'll continue doing it, if you have not specified a terminating criteria before.
We assume that it is A,Irrespective of the size or orientation or wherever it is.
the fox and the chicken or the chicken and grain.
A typical AI analyzes its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of success.
So in the beginning it'll be this, later on it will be the other one and if the opponent starts playing, in chess it is possible that we may not start.
’ Okay , now this is the description provided.
One more is a horizontal line.
Now, the N value depends on the features that you take from the input.
It also aid adds a lot of additional information.
For example, in case of chess, queen has much, much higher value than a pawn.
So if we back it one more level up what will happen?
And I am going to use them in this crossover method.
We’re picking up the best child.
In In case here as well ACO as I said it is will ant will not always use the path with highest pheromone value but the probability is higher okay .
The heuristic search module, heuristic search method is a method, which is not blind like BFS, DFS and generate and test.
Standard objection detection techniques will also work here.
One which talks about the tour cost which is already incurred.
Thank you all.
In fact nearest neighbor is quite interesting.
You can also write a formula.
So, I I won't spend time talking about this.
When fox and chicken, fox value is two ,chicken value is four total becomes six.
Well, we'll actually going to see and find out how how useful it is for solving a travelling salesman problem.
There are other ways of doing it.
Now ride is an act, okay .
So, this is called branch and bound, this is some simple method.
It cannot understand because it has the ability to understand Gary Kasparov’s moves but it cannot understand this move.
One, I may provide the image of my friend but the output says he is not.
So that additional Pakistan will have a link and that link will indicate LOC, that means that link describes the location where this particular action has happened.
You've seen in the last module that whenever we we encounter some statements, they they do not only refer to that single case but they represent complete scenario,for example, when I say that I went to watch a match, I not only talk about viewing a match but I talk about many other things like I whenever I, for example, that that happens in normal communication as well.
Because, his opponent will want to play.
And we have seen in fact, we have hinted that one can use heuristic to determine which move is better than the other , which we are going to address in the next module.
Sometimes a small statement will require two to three pages, full of conceptualizations.
And here is an example given on the on the slide. Dead is minus ten.
Let us look at okay , the rule number one, moving from left to right.
That’s called State Space.
That means X Z value can be maximum three , the initial state is eight zero zero, Okay .
So I don't need to describe the entire rule once again, but you can see that it is the same.
Those pheromone values are indicators for others.
As I said it’s daunting for most of the cases, even our trivial case, it’s not easy.
What is bike?
But if I I know there's a only few places
At no point of time the missionary should be less, okay .
This is because of lot of advancement in this particular field this neural network.
What is the disadvantage?
Now, this is one very important difference.
So this is the solutions search.
So, that is not part of the start state, first condition is not satisfied.
Lot of abnormal cases might be there because every other system says that it is malaria, but the patient has typhoid.
Now Do what does Nobita do with that stick is not mentioned in the statement.
Explore the tree as long as you can get the static evolution function value, back the things up , till the topmost node, based on that pick up the best move from there on.
They and their students produced programs that the press described as astonishing: computers were learning checkers strategies (c. 1954) (and by 1959 were reportedly playing better than the average human), solving word problems in algebra, proving logical theorems (Logic Theorist, first run c. 1956) and speaking English.
Let us first of all, talk about those prerequisites.
That's the path.
You can't move forward.
Goal stack planning is again a very simple way of planning.
You can see that the body of part describes.
So, they thought, that let us try to see how human brain does it and they worked on it and they tried they tried to mimic the working or functioning of human brain into computer programs.
That probability does not remain the same.
Now the tour child A begins from E, C, B, G, A, F and D Okay .
Saving is not these moves, but then the entire search trees which are generated by those moves.
In in case of annealing schedule it says that if the temperature is this you will have to do this. If temperature is this, you will have to do this.
There's a problem which is possible to be solved but then we don't have programs which can play table tennis.
So, you have Milkha Singh and double arrow PTRANS.
And in fact, a single statement might require multiple conceptualization.
So or for example a match, viewing a match, a track is a cricket match so you're talking about basically cricket match viewing Okay ?
In the first module, we have looked at what AI is and what the what are the problems which AI is trying to address and so on and so forth.
What does they do?
Mini, Why it is called MiniMax?
So, L number of output units.
When we write general rules , the problem is that there is there has to be something.
Okay . Why sparse neighbourhood is to be chosen?
and if it is so they they use their smelling and hearing ability to figure out if they are nearby and at the first sight of the enemy around they start running.
What you need?
What the other example we have shown on the the slide the.. how to build a robot which can do all household chores?
So, this is exactly what I have on the right side.
Next three , we are moving missionaries.
With that we’ll come to an end of this module.
If you look at the second one - deletion, intersection, the start state, that also is phi.
You can see that.
Eight five three gallon water milk jug problem is little different.
So that is if that is very similar to hill climbing if if you reach to a place where it is impossible to apply any rule, a dead end, provide best so far.
It is coming out of eyes and where they are going, doesn't make any sense here.
You can see that should not because he has gone but then he heard about the the demise of his grandfather and he has come back.
What they tried to do is they tried to learn the neurons, how the neurons of brains have functioning and tried to mimic the very neuron in in the computer domain that is called artificial neuron.
So, you may need to do that.
I’ve already talked about the need.
Testing and evaluation comes next.
Now let us see how the next method called Breadth-first search works.
Why it is required?
The field was founded on the assumption that human intelligence can be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it.
It is possible to choose a function which produces less number of nodes which is called Sparse neighbourhood function or I can have more number of nodes which is called Dense neighbourhood function.
It provides fault tolerance.
okay So, if you write a mathematical equation and when you are representing a real world, this is something which is tricky.
So, when I say that Irfan is Irfan height Irfan is tall.
Now, let us begin the exploration of the algorithm itself, the MiniMax algorithm.
But here usually a simpler method is picked up, you apply fitness function and out of twenty select five.
It is basically decided by this plausible move generator.
T is temperature but not real is basically our remember it is in case of the annealing process, the physical annealing process, temperature reduction is determined based on the empirical values and their results their their experiments.
So that's what I mean by legal moves.
okay?
At the third player itself you have reached to a dead end.
Dhoni rides a bike.
The latest stable version 4.1.0 is released on July 7, 2019.
An excellent example is, let us look at this particular tour A, B, C, D, E, F, G and again A.
So, what people are going to input the reports, what people are going to see as an output, the key concepts involved in this process.
Let me know, L two zero R one three and B L.
In ChatBot, a Story is a scenario of a conversation that your chatbot has with users.
And when he does that, he he himself learns about his own knowledge, okay .
For example, the other example Jay went to Epicurean which is basically a name of a restaurant which is there in Ahmedabad with his colleagues of his of the office.
If you start thinking like this from the ground level, you probably come out with very, very different, maybe exclusively different from this particular side and still be able to represent your statement.
So, if A plus E is one that means either A is one or E is one.
The neural network should not only recognize my system my signature but should which I already presented or should not only recognize the image which is presented in the database but should also be able to recognize some other image of the same person and that is called generalization.
For example, in chess, there are many heuristics possible.
And I've travelled A to B, B to C, C to D, and at that point of time, it goes beyond Thirty five, it is it becomes Forty.
If the length is more , just terminate.
For example, in our case, we can do but think of a a case of chess.
How do we know?
Even today it is being so.
M two number of missionaries and C two number of cannibals on the right hand side of the river and the boat is on the left side.
And when I have a boat on the left hand side I can only apply rule number one.
But you can see I've already told you that this method is actually an extension to our Breadth First Search or hill climbing.
But that is all a very very common thing.
Think of it
So, what we are doing we we say that this previous state I use this action okay to get this previous state.
And we have seen why a a function like sigmoid is used in some of the algorithms that neural network is using.
It's called Memory Organized Pockets.
Now that's the other word which is being used.
Only modifies the act.
So, they the the biggest advantage of using ant colony optimization is that it is possible to rediscover the shortest path, if there is a problem.
In some other cases people use minus one to one where any real value between minus one to one is acceptable. In our case minus ten to ten usually integer values are acceptable other values are not acceptable.
So, so if fox is on the left hand side, B is two.
It talks about the meaning the statement carries, and we'll be looking at that particular part in this particular module.
Remember, the calculation we requires everything every the sigma that we have seen X X one W one X two W two X three W three and so on.
So, we we’ll we’ll talk about that action previous to the state.
So, these are the three things which happen if you say place on table A, okay .
So if I'm I'm using a small number of nodes as an average number of nodes that you produce, number of children that you produce its called Sparse neighbourhood.
Only when those prerequisites are met, you can apply that rule, otherwise not.
And logic also is required, how how who changes that?
Now, you can see that the script contains somebody called P now, we don't know who this P is, P is basically a placeholder.
The ant is very simple agent with very few functions and wilt has which has very limited intelligence.
It is possible that you miss an optimum par, you miss a solution altogether.
set of rules again in this case, we could write with them in many other cases, we'll be talking about them for...for .
In in case of progression, a a relevant progression is where it removes something which exist in start state but not in the goal state and it adds something which is not there in the start state but there in the goal state.
Extensive plan to help user out from any problems encountered, playing working with expert system also is to be charted out.
We also have rules or moves which can move the problem state from one valid state to another valid state, Okay .
And there is there are other methods which uses Depth-first search.
The advantage is that we'll be able to generalize any size any any orientation anywhere, if you got two different slanting lines in different direction and a horizontal line it is A.
It was for possible in the single layer version.
At minimizing layer we have two options possible winning and losing as the opponent is going to choose and we get the loss.
For example, he would say that when you decide, okay , what are the decision you made.
If one of them is win, what will that person do?
There has to be it has to model the the thinking model of the opponent and then match with it and that's going to be very, very hard.
Okay , We'll talk about some of them in in due course. And set of rules.
And remember, knowledge update is a critical problem and we have seen how critical that is an earlier module.
The opponent.
No , it is not that structured, it is very hard.
People use a lot of other names for this and one very good domain which is called crowdsourcing is also doing something quite similar.
Now, for example, eight zero zero that is converted to zero five three.
In fact, one of my PhD student did exactly that.
The language of the translation is not necessarily error-free or fully logical, but it can be understood.
But if you if you know how and there are some books available on how to write heuristic function for a given domain like chess.
So, that's kind or or health equals to five then he is happy, health health equals to ten then he is ecstatic , okay , kind of representation that is possible using CD .
If if you have if you have seen exactly what I’ve done in the previous case depth bound, you explore the tree and then the next cycle, you explore that tree again and then the next level sounds wasteful.
Okay , the rest is simple.
And complete action many a times cannot be solved by one action so it generates new goals and places there.
I've already told you theres the other one which is quite powerful is called simulated annealing, is an excellent example of how one can innovate from some other domain.
What and we have already seen they leave pheromone trails and decide and all that and there are a lot of variations to this basic algorithm exist.
I assumed it exists so I am not worrying about that right now.
The next slide talks about the shape of the square function.
And a move is something which which allows you to move from one state to the other .
Why we want to avoid the cycle? Let me repeat, we do not want to continue further.
Transfer is an action that redirects a chatbot user to a live chat agent.
Now that's the representation .
And that's the second great thing about the ACO .
Okay , one example here is is is given the handout is that when we go out to dine, we expect it to be a restaurant, obviously.
And the third one.
So it is possible to use GA this way.
The first one is project planning.
So, the first layer of weight is called W one, the second layer of weight is called W two.
It It It moves to and fro and it’s not going directly to the the solution.
Second also connects to first second and third and so on.
Okay Now what we are trying to stress here?
So when we take a move, we come to the next level and again the opponent plays and we get a situation.
For example, I've started from A and I want to reach to Z.
But , the problem with these methods that is going to enter into entangled into something called combinatorial explosion.
For example, in chess, there is something called a threat of fork which we are going to see later or center control or or degree of freedom okay , how free our piece is to move around.
The problem is about a farmer, fox, chicken and the grain finding themselves on the one side of the river and they have to move on the other side.
An example is again shown with the same one and let us use goal stack planning.
That's precisely what we're trying to stress here.
You have to have prerequisites, you have to have variables.
So, validate the prototype comes next.
Can you try to understand what they are?
Customers of the online store can read the review in their own language.
Now, if you encounter this statement, you you also expect a lot of additional things.
Again, explore the next level and so and so. We explore tree, level by level and see if they get a solution.
Could you repeat it?
The translation quality produced by machine translation is not sufficient as such in many situations.
They are quite different from each other. Okay .
Regression is exactly opposite.
If you if you if you have a football match viewing then there is some difference.
Leading AI textbooks define the field as the study of intelligent agents: any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of successfully achieving its goals.
Minimum level, minimum value of the children is passed up.
Machine translation can be particularly important in cases where an acute issue needs to be communicated to a large number of people.
That is the addition that was not there that was not true before now it becomes true so that is an additional thing.
Designing problem logic, conventional diagrams are used in many cases and they are absolutely fine.
Okay .
Deletion is if you just look at this it is phi, there is nothing which is common.
okay , now let us jump into little jargon.
Notice that these new vectors are smaller in dimension than the embedding vector. 
Okay , one more type of search is called Tabu search.
3,5,0 which is already explored is a parent basically of the same node and 6,2,0 is the other one.
For less important products, the quality of machine translation may well be sufficient, for instance, if the product description only includes a couple of sentences.
‘Do’ may come later.
For example, if I get a pay slip, I hardly ever go in fact, I never have and I I’ve not seen others go and ask the clerk.
Based on this, the inputs are provided to the back propagation algorithm.
Basically, ant colony optimization is about learning what others are doing and and learning to solve problems like them.
What are the advantages of this method?
Now you can see that it is not as straightforward as the previous case but it’s still be able to solve because we have picked up a very trivial, very simple, very easy problem to solve.
Learning algorithms work on the basis that strategies, algorithms, and inferences that worked well in the past are likely to continue working well in the future.
There is something called Depth Bound Depth-first search.
We could have applied rule number nine eight six etc.
You can see there are five different cases.
Chat widget
Okay so based on that answer that he has got or if you travel back you can say that because he was late and could not see the toss, Okay .
Okay , so the branching factor, the next thing which we’re trying to explore.
Because we are going to give very clear visibility to every stakeholder.
So what we have?
These are used today.
With that we will conclude this genetic algorithm module number eight.
For example, throw also involves moving of body body part, okay , so that involves the other primitive, which we talk about later called ‘Move’, moving a body part.
General intelligence is among the field's long-term goals.
You have to continuously check whether the performance of the system is improving or not.
The steepest ascent hill climbing, the the little different version of it, you can generate all nodes and pick up the best and and so on.
So, that neural network program could do it.
It would perform quite poorly in unstructured text with significant noise.
There is There are some its called Maxwell's equation and why it is designed?
And they realized that even experts make mistake.
There is a non-uniform background here, maybe generating a uniform background would have helped this case.
Now how it is summed up?
Changes genes drastically but provides an escape route.
In depth bound, you can assume some length, but this iterative deepening, it is it is only going to have one and not more.
okay so you you use multiple agents but eventually it’ll converge to a single path which is the best path.
Is is only the the the magnitude the sign which actually makes the difference but otherwise technically there's no difference.
That is applied in chess and many other cases many times.
So ATTEND is, ATTEND is attaching your sensing organ or attending your se.. se.. sensing organ to something which is coming from outside.
It is impossible.
I have only two rules .
It's very similar to human chess player.
And now let us see what the next two lines describe.
The advantage of this method does not demand the amount of memory that the the BFS demands and that’s why this is adopted by many programming languages.
Results are when you say that Jay Jay went to watch a match and he was ecstatic probably you can get that his favorite team has won because that the result shows result has two outputs happy and not happy, happy when your favorite team has won and not happy when your favorite team has lost.
You you you leave solutions which are not optimal, you choose solutions which are optimal.
So it is and this search process maybe quite jittery that moves across different branches and so on, so forth.
How will you decide the hidden layer?
Why?
What are the rules?
So there is no point exploring J.
Okay , let's move on.
But the important part is to bring the chicken back.
Because you're hungry, so that precondition is added. It also adds that we went inside Jungle Book we were seated, we ordered all that everything is added. Okay , so when we encounter such statements, a series of statements are represented and inserted and that's called invoking a restaurant script.
But then there is a difference.
Thank you.
For example, when you see, the information is coming from eyes, when you hear, the information is coming from ears, when you touch and feel, the information coming from the other senses and so on so forth.
Obviously, we are going to solve the problems, so, we'll have to decide the solution as well in the detail.
Pick up the start node, it’s it’s the current node if it’s the goal, great, you don’t need to do anything.
We, opponent. We, opponent.
Here the conceptualization process actually starts.
Okay , if you >can represent something using a state space it is possible because we have a structured mechanism of moving around in states where starting from the initial state , use legal moves to reach to that final state.
They are they are doing something else.
Now let us see how you can define rules or moves .
P is the probability.
Why P?
But when I'm talking about bank in the context of a picnic, it’s basically a riverbank.
So, it it begins with planning out all differences then insert all the components on the goal stack.
So, that is very, very critical part of this thing.
You may have to also think that.
Same.
Eventually out of million possible cases it just sorts out small range of small set of those chemical compounds in which geologists can actually work on.
You can move in all directions.
The convolution neural network extracts features from the input image(text detected region).
For example, there is a bowler who is very tall, Irfan who is is pretty tall.
There are two outgoing possible paths.
How many times when you say that if I take a packet for deep inspection and I'm right that this packet is really malicious and this deep inspection reveals it.
And detailed documentation is also very, very critical here.
Around 2016, China greatly accelerated its government funding; given its large supply of data and its rapidly increasing research output, some observers believe it may be on track to becoming an AI superpower.
cheu All that is done, now we are going to putting it on on paper, we are finalizing it and you will have to have a tentative plan ready now.
So in MiniMax algorithm, the exploration of tree happens in the winding phase.
Irrespective of the sign.
okay .
We move on to the state called three five zero where we are applying rule number nine and so on .
What we want to have is, two gallons of water in a four-gallon water jug.
But then there is one more important issue.
okay .
Now that is important ‘with a friend’ okay .
I MTRANS match and then the the information is coming from eyes and going to my CP , Okay .
The first work that is now generally recognized as AI was McCullouch and Pitts' 1943 formal design for Turing-complete artificial neurons.
Now this is little more tricky .
Unguided Search Methods means, we don't use heuristics , but we use simple methods to search from the initial state.
So, that is this function.
But there is one more way.
In a normal case when you say that ‘fit’, somebody who can walk two to three or ten, five five-six kilometers maximum, not more.
The language skills of employees can vary a lot.
Now you probably see this graph and wonder what is N because I just said win lose and drawn and why N?
So if two is explored we get minus three, minus two and one .
Some other authors have shown some other way, but basically the algorithm is same, which is the same thing which we have studied in the previous module, we want to describe MiniMax algorithm in nutshell it's the the same thing which we have done.
Everybody every other city than A.
Suppose if you are interested and this is a real world example, suppose you want to write a password cracker and what you are doing is you’re just checking each each password.
They generate solutions,
Third unit will learn to become active and the horizontal line is.
Neural network is come out of AI , is no longer part of AI actually, but still people talk about Neural Network when they talk about AI , Neural network has become a discipline on its own.
To capture that essence this kind of a structure is used.
Please contact us, and our experts will help you find the solution that best meets your needs.
So it's not always be that simple.
If we if you have a move which can provide something called threat of fork.
For example, when Facebook made its API public in 2016, chatbot makers were able to finally integrate their third-party solutions with Messenger.
So, the first one is 3,5,0.
if not we’ll pick up the third sequence and so on, so forth.
This could have been a a five hundred into five hundred or five thousand into five thousand pixel image where there is a signature.
And if you know that the opponent is fond of doing it, make sure that you you keep a component there in in in your static evaluation function which avoid steps where the opponent can get to something like this.
That that is possible.
Usually this value is between minus ten and ten, so that value will give you the the ranking of or the merit of every state that you have at your disposal and you can choose the best one.
That many huge number of nodes.
How do we do that?
And once we go through all this, you probably would realize how important it is.
Sparse neighbourhood gives you less number of nodes.
In fact, the IBM people took three to four years to build this and they spent a lot of money on it rather than though it has beaten Gary Kasparov, I must say that is actually a testimony to that genius for which they have done so much hard work to beat him only three two.
Okay now let us summarize what we need as as components.
For example, when I am coming for college, I am looking for my car keys.
We have looked at two important points: progression and regression.
fine.
So, this is the strategy and based on that we’ll define heuristics and based on these heuristics, the static evaluation function characteristics, we’ll decide the value of a state and you can see these are multiple there are multiple components and even with such a simple case there are more than one five-six components for the heuristic value.
I do not want to highlight the other part of how to represent a statement in a very, very complex way.
okay When Schank has provided his his own as I said, you can come out and have your own primitives.
It starts with the start state start state at a as a root node.
So that is how we do it like that is called constructive search.
So the child one now has E star which which we will still have to fill B, G, A star D.
The other one is called Order crossover.
Now that's fine, it's a mechanical definition of a brother, but can you define brother that way?
Okay , now, the complete sequence of moves.
In simulated annealing, you're allowed to choose a little less optimal path sometimes.
The first process - Selection.
Because the the heuristic function value in this case is decreasing and not increasing.
Because it is past tense.
Okay .
So those who use word objective function use word operator rather than rules.
Probably you will have be able to reason with and get those values filled in.
Can should I explore J?
Begins with eighty-one, has nine into nine total inputs.
We are not taking the earlier string.
Let us pickup something called a Tra...Travelling salesman problem.
For example, all the praise the like deer, what they do?
If I go on doing it, I’ll not be able to solve my problem in my lifetime.
Okay , but then there is a difference.
You may worry or you may query that , what's the difference between branch and bound and nearest neighbor.
So, the representation right now uses a placeholder called Do and he's doing something.
Now an important thing happens.
People at the forensic does something like this.
In case number one, it is impossible to to do something like that in in the milk jug problem.
These are three things happening, Okay .
Quick reply
But anyway this branching factor is an important point in the search process, Okay .
So, that can be easily assumed Okay .
Then again it goes up at that component.
You won't find number of cannibals more than number of missionaries.
So, it is 0 to N okay and you what you add? You add XI WI okay .
in fact generation of solutions one after the other and and doing it in a way that humans and other spaces do in a way that eventually what you get are better solutions search.
Then pheromone it it’s a tendency to evaporate.
So, in either case, this particular sequence is not useful.
Now, this is little different than hill climbing, a little better than hill climbing in some sense.
Now that that love can appear in many ways.
More number of ants coming from either C or E will prefer that path one and that will make it more attractive.
There's path one and path two.
Seven minus one factorial.
To write that we have used complex notations which are pretty hard to write.
Now you know, there are multiple solutions and you prefer better solution.
So if it is the case, BFS and DFS will not stop.
If dead end, we’ll try the right child and again left.
Not only that, because it is more recent also, because it's travelling faster it is more recent, number of pheromone also is more.
Otherwise, it can be a first move, can be the third move, can be the fifth move , so, what's the current state?
In fact, we've already solved laugh the problem.
Because, just assume I have four different children, so for first child I'd calculate this value, a second child I get some value, third for I get some fourth also.
Again, we calculate both of them place on top table place on top BA and addition, remember action is towards this.
So, what we do is we first of all achieve X then Y and then Z and the problem is solved.
You probably think that it is possible.
One thing you probably think that more number of components,more precise your measurement and better it is.
Suppose if I design a heuristic function for Farmer Fox Chicken Grain problem for this, assume that there is a function exist.
You better look at the handout which which clearly and there's one more thing here I’ve not represented hurt as a a a CD representation.
If you have two cannibals on the right hand side, you have to send two missionaries on the right hand side and so on so forth.
Okay .
So point is I can actually decide number of children that I'm going to have, if I'm exploring solution space search.
The static evolution function requires two things, current state as well as player.
We'll be talking about them at the end of this module.
That solution space is now you know, we we can start travelling in search space using two methods.
If it if it is phi acceptable, if it is not, not acceptable.
What are the best uses for machine translation?
I'm guaranteed to get minus three or more.
It is impossible in in some cases but it is it is possible in some cases as well.
How to do that in in a computer program Okay is very important and that's what is is done by in in scripts and Schank and and the other researchers extended that idea of CD into scripts to represent such statements which does not only only represent a single information single conceptualizing but sequence of conceptualization which includes many, many more things actually.
Why?
In machine translation, texts are translated automatically with computer software so that a human translator does not directly participate in the process.
Anyway, we are not going to discuss that thing right now.
And, it stops when there is no path ahead.
These are the only three things the ants are doing, and they can share the information and this is the simplest way of sharing this information.
All all these statements basically mean the same.
One typical solution of farmer, fox, chicken, grain problem is shown.
In fact, one of the programs Schank wrote was called SAM Okay , which can understand, reads like stories like this and and can reason from it, Okay .
It also calculates the error coming back and so on, so forth.
As I said, this over function might check many things, so we're we have not written this function, we've only called this function with two values - current state and current player.
Okay It’s basically a recursive algorithm.
You can see that you begin with all farmer, fox, chicken, grain on the left hand side and so on.
You see that is a darkened narrow, one sided arrow.
For example, one is called recipient case relationship, when the ownership is transferred.
How you can solve a travelling salesman problem using the ant colony optimization?
Based on these two it comes back with static evaluation function value.
The best is obviously C, so you would choose to play the second.
Similarly, H zero also indicate the W zero, in that case H zero, the second layer, okay .
Anyway, so that is one thing which we'll have to work on.
And in fact it should you should explore everything in in a systematic way.
It's very strict form actually you can't have any kind of link that you want, you can't have can't have any type of node and again, allowed links and allowed nodes are always fixed.
And once it is completed, I go out of the stadium and all that is assumed that's called goal driven or expectancy driven reasoning that happens.
Remove the complex background from the image
So, that that is one of the important parts of the formalization.
You can see that this is done if you put on table A then you get this on A table and then place on top BA you get on A on BA and once you do that you can test everything and you will get them.
Now what beam search is?
Companies operating in different industries can accumulate considerable amounts of documentation on products, services and operating models.
Similarly, if you want to get zero you will have to get negative infinity which is also impossible, so it it continues to learn even if it has learnt that thing correctly.
So that is again an example of how you can derive meaning out of this thing.
There are reasons.
Not only that king will have a value which is more than the total of all the values of all other nodes, all other pieces.
This is the same problem like you you have in other disciplines and for which you require standardization and all that.
So, that does not mean it does not mean that this is the right way of doing it.
Because if I if I if I just say, for example, A, B, C, D, I cut.
Those scripts and it is quite possible that two different scripts contain many things in common and they are not represented exactly the same way and so on so forth.
Learners also work on the basis of Occam's razor: The simplest theory that explains the data is the likeliest.
We’ll we’ll or you will have to look at previous statements or next statement to figure out what that ‘Do’ is.
I have already talked about that in the first module, let us talk about that again.
okay And that is important.
Now how it processes?
So, nothing then it is present tense.
You just lay pheromone again once you reach to the last segment, lay pheromone value again and then again start the process.
Sometimes it is possible that a static node is here, the ending node is quite far and the surrounding nodes there are plenty of surrounding nodes in a near that thing .
We have seen six different options possible for a Tic Tac Toe case and you will have to evaluate those cases to figure out exactly what is static evolution function’s value.
The other method you just get all solutions, okay and pick up the best solution, refine that solution, okay , pick up the solution.
You will have to reduce the summation.
So, these are called dependencies and dependencies are part of CD .
There is no you you have nothing to choose actually.
So I travel along one path and I get the distance from A to Z using that path is say thirty-five.
Acceptable! And number of missionaries and number of cannibals on either side of the river.
So, let us see what we can do.
Then W plus now, you talk about the next input.
Why it’s called local?
So that is one thing which we do not want .
Unlike that frames are quite similar.
The word order may be odd, or a single word may have been replaced with a strange synonym.
But for some other problems that is a better method we’ll see that thing in in in our eighth module when we look at genetic algorithms.
And there are events like reading menu and ordering and and eating and paying the bills and so on, so forth happening.
so opponent will not choose that.
Relevant and non-relevant actions.
And when you invoke that script, the complete information available in that script is inserted into the representation.
But then, if you provide friend’s image, you should say friend and it says the other one, the other one is provided, says friend, these are the examples of misclassification.
The traditional problems (or goals) of AI research include reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception and the ability to move and manipulate objects.
So these two things are being sent back.
For example, chess, you have a a branching factor of around thirty five.
In in one way, we have already done like for example missionary cannibal problem you start from three, three, zero, zero then move along and at the end you get zero, zero, three, three.
Now that’s something which is an advantage of Depth Bound Depth-first search.
So, you you use one heuristic function for example, you use one heuristic function which uses value four for parent and three and two for children.
However, this is a computationally expensive task.
Now the rest is to be picked up from other parent, that means child one will have other cities from parent one and child two will have city cities from parent two, Okay
You can upload your data, annotate it, set the model to train and wait for getting predictions through a browser based UI.
How?
So, this is an example of how addition or deletion can be done.
M one greater than or equal to C one, M one equal to zero or M one M two is greater than C two or M two equal to zero and M one plus M two equal to three C one plus C two plus equal to.
clears nose The next one is called PTRANS or physical transformation like abstract one, which was there before, okay .
They are able to solve some problems, unsolvable for years.
So, you can see that in a relation called POSS-BY or possessed by Sachin’s elbow.
Okay , this is the current state and we say minus on CD that is on CD is place on top additions okay that is the only addition that we have.
One slanting line like this, the other slanting line like this.
What we have seen in this module?
How can the move assume that value?
Okay , so, that’s something which is very different from a computer program, computer system, and and human brain.
So, that's the case here.
Ideally, it should mimic expert’s consultation model.
We have seen that AI is about solving difficult problem and GA is one great way of solving difficult problems.
The statement does not give you from where he started.
So, the biggest advantage of CD is that such things are represented using the same structure.
Theres no technical reason okay .
You may ask me, is it a good move?
So to reach to D this is the minimum bound okay .
A chatbot is software that imitates human-like conversation with users via websites and mobile messaging apps.
Okay , and then there are some scenes. The scenes are you can see that quite interestingly P PTRANS P to the stadium.
Okay , problem in our case, the problem is pretty trivial.
Okay .
We've seen the rules are very pretty simple, addition and subtraction.
There are many other ways in which you can represent this algorithm.
Now we start along some other path.
Latte
okay , If it is feasible to have some machine learning, so, you just can take data from reputed sources like doctor’s logs and and the blog is written by somebody and genuine medical books and things like that and and just bring it to the database.
In a 2017 survey, one in five companies reported they had incorporated AI in some offerings or processes.
The the case number two and three also indicates the players movement okay .
Look at the first figure, talking about alpha cutoff.
If you if you get that right, yes everything else becomes easy but unless you get that it’s it’s it's pretty hard.
One three two one zero is possible . Why you you can just pour out three out of the jug.
Pretty complex.
Okay , there's one script which is a very simple script which I have provided in the handout of watching match.
Now, that is not good, you're going away.
Otherwise, we’ll go back to the second step.
Now this is not all that simple because what you are planning to do is to solve on BA first.
For example, why Jay asked who won the the toss can be answered in two ways.
One outcome is that I provide image of the friend and it recognizes it correctly.
Now we are going to talk about GAs in an algorithm, genetic algorithm.
So, this is an important thing okay and a very simple description of an action - place on top XY, three things, every action is described in this three different using these three different attributes in in PDDL .
Which class is a friend of other class if you're coding in C++, there’s a concept of friend, kind of.
So, based on such information, we can provide heuristic value.
Long almost twenty years, after long period somebody could find multi-layer perceptron, multi-layer neural network and could actually demonstrate that it can solve almost every problem that comes across.
What we do is something very different.
So this is the the partially mapped crossover method. Okay .
Sometimes people say it’s a case of common sense but common sense believe me my friend is very, very uncommon .
Now at in this phase, expert system, whatever expert believes it to be we his rules, processing got a lot of rules of thumb about everything and all that is understood by knowledge engineer and recorded.
Now, that is some something  else which we are not discussing right now, but Constraint Satisfaction also is pretty simple to understand.
They are not using square function as it is.
For example, with Messenger integration, you can connect ChatBot with Messenger or Slack with no coding.
The lowermost part is called unwinding phase.
X two into W one two one X three W three one.
But some of the texts in bounding boxes are not recognized correctly.
Next four we are not moving them.
It's distinct path is tour covering all cities.
And the function obviously is called heuristic function rather than objective function.
Not only that, the expert also learns something out of it.
For example, after three years of service, you probably give one foreign trip with spouse to every employee or you have if you have two children, you pay the school fees for those two childrens and the other cost, you bear those costs and so on, so forth.
The article here proved to be a helpful resource in writing the code for this project.
So, if we have reached to the player, in in the earlier case we have looked we have found that six is a an as a value for the ply.
In most cases that will solve your problem. The next slide talks about how hidden unit learns to be active.
Then you will have to decide once that that basic questions are answered.
A bat and and this this process of transformation, bat depends on this thing actually.
Remember we will have to have set of better solutions and combines their parents randomly and combine good elements of parents and so and so forth.
In fact when we we explore the tree we we explore the tree for a case, the next case, the partial solution tree.
I can sacrifice queen for this pawn because this pawn is more important for for me right now.
Now, you may be surprised what that one is.
Many people would in fact prefer communication in their native language, which would decrease ambiguity.
But in real case real problem case we have plenty of rules.
You can take the grain on the other side.
So, the the terrorists become the actor and the hostage become the recipient, okay .
I'm not going to play C, what's the point?
So it is right.
Artificial intelligence
Because Sita is happy because of that.
That is not allowed.
They are added on the right hand side.
So, that is one way of showing, but then how many such moves can you write for the chess?
And here okay , every this is ATRANS represents an action, transformation of ownership and it has an actor, the actor is the person who initiates that process. For example, when I say that Sachin gave his bat to Sarfaraz, Sachin is an actor but if you say that Sarfaraz received a bat from Sachin, Sarfaraz is an actor.
It is basically a weighted average.
One you travel further and say that because he wanted to know who has come to bat Okay who is going to come to bat.
Machine translation can be used in a large variety of situations.
In fact , you can see that this is the initial state while this is the final state .
The third one is called Cyclic crossover.
We have looked at a problem called Three Four Gallon Water Jug problem and Eight Five Three Gallon Milk Jug problem where we've shown how why they they those problems can be represented using state space and so on so forth.
I choose top five from it,
That's the other thing.
So, with that probability we are jumping to that node otherwise not. Okay .
After every input we adjust weights.
Now you can see in this particular case, minus three, two, one and three, all four of the nodes are explored .
The other example is is one more of my student who used neural networks to find out best set of motivational strategies for employees.
Here is the description.
So, you can clearly state that is not relevant.
We will be discussing about Neural Networks this time.
There are a lot of things possible, four three is possible, four zero is possible, zero three is possible.
So, we’ll have only two different types of images.
An in fact if if you have read about something called Felder-Silverman model, if you're a teacher probably, you have heard about that Felder-Silverman model and and Myers-Briggs model, that was little older.
Here, why it is called partially mapped crossover?
One expert gives ten percent weightage to a component, some other will give twenty percent of this thing .
So, five ply is deeper, six ply is deep, so that depth of that ply is indicated by current depth.
I just wanted to highlight the negation.
First, the network proposes the region which would possibly have the test and then classify the region if it has the text or not.
I I can apply that thing at level one.
Take a set of random sequences as nodes in the state space, the solution space.
You can move that piece forward.
And again, they may not be the same in in all cases, okay .
‘Jay went to watch an ODI, he was late, when he occupied his seat, asked his fellow spectator who won the toss?
Also, we have seen relevance of a state.
Because only administrator will be able to give rights to these developers and testers and all that.
If you do not use heuristics, unguided.
In case number one, we say that it is the summation is beyond greater than the threshold value, there is a problem okay the sorry greater than the threshold value it it’s a friend, but we provide something else and it still the summation is beyond that.
We’ll see in the next module how exactly back propagation is going to solve the problem but this even the algorithm we’ll look at the complete algorithm in the next module.
Okay .
As I said in last ten years, how many times you asked for and how many times you were successful?
So we can solve it manually and can instruct the program to do it.
Okay so that the next condition represents that.
Okay , so you provide those employees, twenty, thirty employees and their fifty odd images of each one of them is fed into the system.
If I I can make sure that my knight is in a place which threat of fork to the opponent can capture an important piece of the opponent like Queen, I have an advantage.
You you just try in that direction, could not solve the problem, come back and try some other direction, that is quite possible.
This comes in handy if you want to personalize your chatbot communication.
okay .
In some cases, player and opponent or something, okay .
The problems could be if you're using sparse neighbourhood we might be ignoring some important moves.
Second o ne, A dot deletion, A dot deletion again you take an intersection with goal state.
Attributes help a chatbot personalize its responses.
It is again pretty simple.
So, when you're throwing or or when you're kicking something or or doing something where you you apply physical force, you're talking about propel.
It starts with one, Okay and then again start, have two levels of tree and then again start have have the three levels of tree and so and so forth.
First, a bad move is allowed with some probability, okay . And that probability changes over a period of time.
You may be surprised the word average and and the value six point two, the value six point two clearly indicates what the value is while greater than average it's more like a fuzzy logic system and that's true.
No difference okay .
Number of missionaries should be more or equal to number of cannibals on either side of the river.
The other precondition is, if A equal to not Fr what does that mean the farmer is not on the the left side, okay A is on the left side .
They see if the the fingerprint is curved or square or broken or things like that.
Only farmer can row the boat.
The next one is propel.
We have not written a function over, we assumed a function called over.
Okay . You reached to four you can’t move further, Okay that’s that’s called local maxima, Okay .
The other interesting thing is that the strength of CD also is the weakness.
And it is quite good.
There's going to be a database coder, who is going to design database for it.
So it is A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I and it is a little longer and littler different.
As I said the GA is not the usual content for AI this thing .
This one is possible to be done in the other way, which I'm not going to talk about right now.
Settling on a bad, overly complex theory gerrymandered to fit all the past training data is known as overfitting.
If the documentation to be translated needs to be easy to understand and, especially, if the documentation is critical in terms of safety, the appropriate solution is post-edited machine translation or traditional translation by a professional translator.
That again is not very good, because something we want to move towards start state but we are deleting something which is part of the start state and we are also adding something which is not part of the start state.
We have already seen how a problem can be represented using a state space and move around in state space and so on so forth.
We are going in utmost detail means every component of the problem is clearly defined and told that this is to be solved.
what the content of that sample, Okay and it tries to figure out, Okay .
So, when there are many other cases.
Our queen is captured.
Why it is called steepest ascent?
For example, an example is given in the handout I'm I’m just quoting that example.
You don't have time.
Now why that is better?
Then you have an object what what is the object for M trance? match, Okay .
So, here you can see that there was no mention of bullet or or or or the gun, but it is it is there in the representation.
For example, when we are talking about water jug problem, we think that the water is available.
And there are many problems with CD .
Okay so those paths are already found so that pheromone value will of a segment, okay , is equal to total number of ants travelled multiplied by the pheromone value that they have sprayed on that .
Then let the solutions combine, merge together and generate new solutions.
You can't backtrack and then redo it.
If you don't say so, it is assumed it is default.
[a] Alternatively, an evolutionary system can induce goals by using a fitness function to mutate and preferentially replicate high-scoring AI systems, similar to how animals evolved to innately desire certain goals such as finding food.
C grain, not grain S chicken, not chicken D is grain, not grain, okay .
you can see on the slide that you have one typical position on the left hand side, one typical position on the right hand side and just show that the move is characterized by having the position of the pieces here which is shown on the left hand side and the the result of the move is something that you have it on the right hand side.
So if you look at that array you can easily understand the children that you’re generating is already explored.
Whether I get my salary right or I don't get it right.
For example, the network is really slow and that that prompts me to think that there has to be something malicious happening.
So we won't have that chance.
They have to be three.
Then we have seen how to use a predicate act.
How it is doing we will see.
What does that mean?
So you don't require to apply minimum, it's always maximum.
That is altogether a different thing.
So, those values are like fuzzy logic values, depends on context.
In this module we have what we have done?
In chess, it is possible to have a situation where you cannot proceed further, there is no way to proceed further.
But mutation is very important.
So, PTRANS talks about changing of location.
Next one is ten.
Now this is an example of a fleeting script mentioned.
Okay , so that's the problem.
And once you decide those differences, those differences are added on the stack and you just pick up the first different, find out which action is suitable to remove this or eliminate this difference and provide that.
knowledge engineers learn the basic idea about the domain, also learn how expert processes the knowledge, how it stores that knowledge, what is good and bad about this system, what to concern about, where to focus more and so on and so forth he learns.
The the value, the which comes next the suffix, zero one that value indicates which input unit to which output unit.
And if you if you can somehow manage that it becomes easier for us to choose moves which are better and complete the search process in real time.
We have discussed last four steps of expert system design process.
So, you can see.
Now if you using pure Hill Climbing, you can't move forward.
So, if I do that, I I have to step away from only labelling, I'll have to give some value and that value when we we give that value we call it static evaluation function which is quite similar to heuristic function.
First requirement is that the solution path should not contain any cycles.
Then and then the state is valid, otherwise the state is not valid.
What we do is, we just get all those images, store those images in in in in the database, provide each image to the algorithm, we call it neural network algorithm or Back propagation neural network or some other algorithm.
If you look at the next figure TSP with refinement search titled image, you can see that you will get distance between every node to every other node and that is also depicted as a table, as a distance matrix, okay .
So out of that you choose the best okay maximum pheromone value and go ahead and go ahead means you pick up the next segment and the next stegment okay .
This is the current state, the start state.
Thus it is tested this way and and that's critical part in the processing.
Welcome friends to twenty first module of AI .
It has to have more number of components and sort of capability to decide what what the opponent is thinking.
One is variable descent neighbourhood method where you use different neighbourhood functions which let you determine number of children for a given state.
Mahesh hurting Jayesh and second Mahesh is also throwing a stone.
Welcome friends!
Let us look at the state space.
okay So, planning also is part of formalization and also like if you have taken some OR course, you probably know what I'm talking about.
In practice, the material to be translated is transmitted in an encrypted form between the client and the machine translation system.
Lot of researchers were interested in learning about this and they have found very, very simple method that they are using for doing this, which is basically implemented in computer program and it can actually used to solve many search algorithms.
The heuristic function exactly tells you the value, Okay .
The reason is that if you do it that way, remember with every move you will have to explore the search tree and how to apply static evaluation function to all leaf nodes.
Marvin Minsky agreed, writing, within a generation ... the problem of creating 'artificial intelligence' will substantially be solved.
Number of input units is decided based on the input okay , the size of file that you take for input.
Okay let us let us see that.
Now, the question is whether it can learn or not that is one thing, but it also is theoretically it is possible that it can learn.
For example, we have a solution space where we have every node describing a solution.
That's great.
So, there is a layer one, layer two, layer three.
A parent maybe a children, to a children and so on, so forth.
So, if you choose say value P is point three so the probability of number generated less than point three is obviously point three.
They are called script headers, the the the props, the roles, the actions and if you find that, Okay , mentioned in the script in the statement, the script is invoked.
Let let me talk about how they find the shortest path.
We'll soon see how that happens and basically is depth limited.
One more is called ATTEND, now when you focus your sense, sensing organ to to something for example when I'm reading, I'm focusing my eyes on newspaper or when I'm listening I'm I’m focusing my ear on the other party's words and whatever so, the in all these cases.
Irrespective of what is the value of the other one. Other one maybe ten, that is better, but is always five or more.
Remember NodeInfo is a structure which we are going to define later.
In case number one there I can play and you can see the bold face X is our movement if I place in case of A it is little better because B is not very good because the third space is already occupied and playing elsewhere is not also very good.
Now this is only about one source, one destination and you will have to do this for all destinations and from those destinations to all other nodes.
Same about D and H okay only the value is eight.
And if if you have a serious detailed script, which the example that I gave is not one, very simple one just use for pedagogy purpose.
okay , number of missionaries on either side is less than number of cannibals.
So, that's the problem.
In some cases, yes, okay .
The difference here is is about the the application of heuristic function nothing other than that.
Now let let us learn little more about human genome.
So here it it’s very similar to human being or even living forms.
In fact, the algorithm is pretty simple.
As is well known, shared information is the best kind of information, but in a multinational company, the documentation would first need to be translated into several languages.
And the solution basically is is a method of starting from initial state, move around in state space using legal moves and reach to a final state.
So, you require that coder also.
So, there's the other solution here is PAM and there are a few other attempts which are mentioned in the the knowledge representation and there are two description logic and the on the Web Ontology Language.
The first one.
I just choose six,zero,two Okay .
you get a string with very, very different characteristic,
Number of missionaries and number of cannibals.
what if I have a case of only twenty five twenty six cities?
Okay , smoke is ingesting, the smoke inside the lungs. Okay .
Okay , so in the child.
More importantly, we must understand that this is an idea how how to represent a language statement of a language using simple primitives.
So, a four gallon water jug will have two gallons of water at the end.
You can see that other two things are already done C is on top of D it’s already there and D top of table.
And, when we only have an estimate it is likely that we try in one direction, we may fail, we have to try in the other direction and so on, so forth.
Look at the slide.
Reading is about transforming the MTRANS information from for example, I'm I’m reading a newspaper.
So we can't jump from one state to the other unless we have a legal move connecting them.
And if I have large number of nodes, it's called Dense neighbourhood.
If you have seen the the algorithm cleverly, you you would see that the the value that we return is is also written in negative form.
If you feel the same while reading about chatbots, or talking about them with others, have a look at my list of essential chatbot terms.
A B C D is farmer, fox, chicken, grain.
And whenever you encounter a statement, which probably contains many simple things about the world, those things are collected together, represented as a collection in in conceptual dependency, and in fact that is the great thing so there are thirteen total primitives, eleven plus then one was added later and and one more.
How good is that method?
So that that adds randomness to movement in the initial run in a way that you escape from local minima and it is proved to be quite useful.
Because when MYCIN did something similar, it got seventy two percent accuracy.
That’s why the word optimization appears in this case and also it’s very interesting that the ants can also rediscover the short path the shortest path, how they do it?
For example, finding out right set of, now this quite interesting.
PDDL as I said is used for this purpose.
The conceptualization is over and now I'm going to formalize my system.
Not only that, you can even go ahead and pick up some other brands, some other node which is better than three, you can do it.
This is a harder problem but we only have two moves.
For example, it can recommend an exact product that interests a customer.
And it unless it cannot find a food source it is not going to come back.
Software integration
But the problem is, I have to decide number of missionaries and cannibals, which I did .
In fact I just said that for twenty employees, each of the employees I I have fifty images.
So what does that mean? I I I’m given a chess board position, I apply that heuristic function, that heuristic function will give you give me a value between minus ten and ten.
If this match is a football match, you probably have other roles like the linemen and the referees and and so on and so forth.
Now what we are doing?
okay .
You probably read this or look at the PowerPoint slide to read more about and understand, because I've given a lot of examples of intrusion detection system and other systems in in my discussion, which I couldn't do it here, because because of the time constraint.
So okay , so that's the point.
So, the values there are there are many variables used and those values are are between minus ten to ten.
So, that person is also required.
What's the point in travelling along?
And who is propelling it?
But that's a pretty hard part of the state space representation and solving problems using state space.
He learns about conveying his idea now.
So, more numbers you provide, in most cases it is better.
He attributes this to an increase in affordable neural networks, due to a rise in cloud computing infrastructure and to an increase in research tools and datasets.
In the middle part, you you should try to use as many M as possible, which is legally allowed.
Software integration is the process of two or more applications being connected.
Number of output units depends on number of outputs that you would like to classify.
It is about picking up a random state and checking if it is a solution.
I'm exploring one branch and I may also be exploring one more branch.
We’ll skip that thing for a while.
okay , The program should interact with patient as if the program itself is a doctor.
That is sigmoid function, which you can see drawn on the second slide, okay .
Next one.
Current state is defined as free A on AB on BC on CD and on D table okay .
Okay Into one there is a structure called NodeInfo which the algorithm returns.
This is a move .
Only a human can interpret, for instance, the multi-level meanings of a journalistic or literary text.
How will I represent a move ?
For example, if we we take up a detailed script which we have not done and we have talked about very, very simple script but assume that there is a detailed cricket match viewing script and we're talking about that script.
Then example, you say that Jay watched the match and come back home by bus.
You have a long term maintenance plan, you decide that thing and write that thing down.
These rules that I talked about thirteen fourteen rules.
When I'm doing it?
Combinatorial explosion is number of options that you have.
Roles are people who are involved in the script and this is a general assumption and that might change.
Even though machine translation solutions are developing all the time, it must be kept in mind that the translations they produce are not completely free of errors.
Because it's very, very hard to characterize.
Filters help your chatbot decide which response should be sent to users based on the context and the information the user provides.
So B mapped to B, B is mapped to G and A is mapped to E, Okay .
We almost always explore game trees partially because most cases it is impossible to do one.
So, what does ant do?
You can see that this search process is jittery obviously and I’ve told you the reason for it.
We have zero, this is better, so we move there, then minus one, not good, two, better, go there, four, we’re moving along quite nice, Okay , four.
We are going to look at a particular version of that algorithm in in a pseudo code form to understand it clearly.
You can fill this thing and whatever is remaining you you can keep here.
The top one is max that is we are playing.
And level, if you look from the levels of tree, it is two but number of nodes it’s three. clear nose Okay .
So, you should try to mitigate the the consequences if the decision is wrong and how you do that is also to be part of this thing.
In certain cases like this value of pawn maybe more than a queen.
Most of the commercial programs use many static evaluation evaluation function components like Deep Thought had eight thousand odd components.
What if it is more ?
But anyway, well , I'll talk about that example soon.
If he has not learned, expert expert should be able to explain him what is lacking and why and all that.
A spectrometer reading and there is something called mass resonance spectrometer reading.
Suppose example there are ten moves and you reach to seventh move which is not acceptable, so seven eight nine ten four moves you can take all combinations of that and try.
Attribute with an actor is also possible to be used.
C has three B has two and E has again two, and now if you look at those values, B has two children, F is five and G is three, minus three.
What the requirement is, that at no point of time you can have number of cannibals more than number of missionaries on on on any bank of the river.
In In case of a A to B it is two twenty and A to D is two twenty-plus two fifty plus one fifty.
So, that these are all examples of primitives, in fact Schank added plan later.
That is not going to work.
We are going to define these are the tasks and these are the tasks which and this is the order for this task.
And empty i,j j minus one, in fact that's the next block.
Let me recap this this is part is pretty important.
So, we we do late binding.
So our goal is not achieved if you do it this way.
Whatever is added and you have interact section with the goal state and if this is phi that means you have added many things with nothing is part of the goal state it’s a fruitless exercise, it should not be phi.
We have already seen.
There are total ten is to ten neurons in the brain and total ten is to fourteen interconnections, that mean, there are almost one thousand connections from a neuron to other neurons.
So, what you're supposed to do is to divide the experts knowledge into knowledge chunks or knowledge segments and knowledge segments is made up of many rules.
No, there is some difference.
How?
This raises philosophical arguments about the mind and the ethics of creating artificial beings endowed with human-like intelligence.
For example, in the case number one, we have three two, the case number two we have four four zero, is a final state.
In case of being decreased for a good move this called valley descending.
If the ant has travelled some other path without having a food source, will not going to come back the pheromone value will evaporate.
It can come down but the problem is that if it comes down, there's a threat from the the rook.
Now, in travelling salesman problem you have cities, they are connected and those connections we we call them segments.
And this process is like black box.
AI often revolves around the use of algorithms.
So, those and what what’s the role of an action?
Now the longer path for example, in ten seconds this ant make five trips, this ant make four trips.
You will have to find some other way.
Now, as I say I have five, so it will pick up one and five or pickup two and three and pick up one and four and so on.
Solution search can be done in either way.
Okay .
So is it kind of a dead end or or loss, Okay , a failure.
So this this process allows those characteristics ability to climb, ability to swim and all that in in the offspring.
will initialize the bast with whatever minimum value.
If it is not, we can run in parallel, you can start.
Now implementation planning is basically how you're going to implement this, deciding about the the classes and all that.
You can see that that the third unit learns to become active and there is the other line.
So, it’s not all that wasteful, Okay .
Okay , one may one more example is replace a move not changed for long .
So this temperature is actually an artificial value that we take.
Delta E is a difference between the previous and the current state or the current state and the next state that we are trying to explore. Okay .
So let us let us look at this.
Cappuccino
So, it will will never have that data loss kind of an issue.
So the time is always our biggest constraint, exactly like chess.
Now this is something which you should try to avoid.
He stabbed Ravan or shot Ravan or cut his head into two by sword.
Obviously because this is the only one rule I can apply.
So, everything that I talked about is is is shown here.
So, that is very critical here.
Look at three examples given in on the slide. 8-0-0, 3-5-0, 8-0-0.
So that is very expensive.
Obviously, when any spaces have to live and and when the condition is that the resources are limited they will have to fight for the survival.
Now state space says L A B C D and R E F G H.
People say it is the worst thing, but then they did the same thing with experts and they they have found to be between sixty two to sixty five.
And C and F as I said that they are directly copied because there is they are not part of the map.
We have no option.
Done.
You meet your friend after many years and he has grown in all dimensions but you’ll still be able to recognize him.
The next one is called GRASP, which is which has very clear meaning, so you don't need to worry more about GRASP, GRASP is picking up something holding it.
what I do is I I'll just mingle them in a way that or in a way that I generate new nodes out of it.
Why?
Manoj gave him the chocolate.’
Apply next rule if no operator is left return with best so far.
Okay .
Seven cities are connected to each other using direct roads.
So it it it directs the behavior in successful directions and inhibits unsuccessful directions.
In this technique, a sliding window passes through the image to detect the text in that window, like a convolutional neural network.
Let us go for a second ply and see what difference does it make.
You can see that it is not dependent on MTRANS.
If you teach a student how to draw A and recognize A, any sized A he should be able to recognize later, so that is called generalization.
Given a solution state, I can actually generate multiple solution states from it.
okay , that's the initial state.
Now that is something where you combine multiple things into one.
So that is T value is decided by designers intuitions and judgement and it is done empirically.
For example , let us again take that solutions search method of mi...missionary cannibal problem.
Okay , learning is a process which for for getting such a weight which can identify every input as correctly.
When the rule is complex, we have seen that we need to write less number of rules which are general.
So you can see that when script is invoked, all of these are assumed .
It says noding for NF, is a new node which is defined, NF.Path is equal to NULL Now, why the path is null?
What are the advantages of this representation?
Some presentations are simpler compared to others.
And collection of all valid states is called a state space .
Now, it is a little different.
But even in this case, how many moves that we can write is going to be substantial.
Let's see what how can I write the state space and this is going to be much more complex than the previous case, little more complex, okay .
okay even if some pieces are there in between knight, you know those does not create obstacle for a knight.
How that is done is the essence of this ant colony optimization.
The model performed pretty decently here.
Their dimensionality is 64, while the embedding and encoder input/output vectors have dimensionality of 512. 
Assume an assembly of people from multiple countries and the speaker is speaking in one typical language and there is a program called translator which what that program does is just listen to what the person is speaking and try to translate that into the language, okay .
We need to have some strategy to move around in state space and there are some characteristics of that strategy also.
We are also telling that Sachin not only went to LA, but he used a plane for his movement.
We do not have heuristic function here.
For example, if you use a sparse neighbourhood you just replace to adjacent or or or exchange to adjacent city information.
That is shown in the next rule.
So that’s the problem withs this method.
But the knowledge, we don’t really know how it is being done because it is encoded in form of weights, that’s why it is called the black box of reasoning.
If missionary is zero cannibal can be one or two, okay clears nose .
So if, even if I explore, that node will give me ten is of no use.
Well, that is an additional prop that you will have and not others.
We have already seen the min layers are where the opponent is playing and max layer is where we are playing, okay .
NodeInfo object contains these two value and NodeInfo contains one is path the other is value.
I am not going to discuss that thing right now.
Ram killed Ravan.
You assume that I I purchased a ticket, I I I went into the stadium I am seated on my seat, I view the match and and and looked at the toss then in first inning and the second innings hopefully I'm talking about ODI .
Machine translation can be integrated into the translation process so that the translations can be published automatically, or quality assurance by human professionals can be connected to the process.
Okay So, we are considering L to be six, then all three cases are are possible to be provided, Okay .
So this kind of representation is called State Space representation.
We have looked at some of the prerequisites, we have looked at labeling as W L and draw.
The resources, for example, X-ray machine and deep inspection.
But it is justified because we’re looking at an AI problem.
So that is the third rule.
So, whoever initiates the process, whoever is is the actor, is associated with this particular association, this this particular the primitive, okay , okay .
And again, what is the I value?
The algorithm works like this.
If you use branch and bound we’ll try travelling in this direction continuously for a quite large period and that's why it takes it will take more time in converging.
In our character recognition case, the N value is eight- one okay .
This is called feed forward.
So, later on if somebody talks about bullets or guns or something, you can relate that to this thing, okay .
So, prototype will give you an idea how the final system would look like and and prototype can be very, very simple, proto en cal be as good as the final system.
Okay , so that is what best first search is.
Check it! Number of missionaries three, number of cannibals three.
Now this part is already done okay .
It’s kind of a generalized representation of a statement and it's quite similar too, if if you have some idea about how Unix works or Linux works.
A is what?
That is the beginning part of the conceptualization and then normal user is also invoked.
We’ve already seen that it is possible to represent the problem using State-space.
The other case where you've already won or lost.
Well, that's what I said in the beginning that you can use CD as an interlingua.
Language has its own boundaries and the problem with that also is inherited into CD .
okay so on and till the last one and remember, total values are M okay .
This is what we want.
For example, take a case of finding out who the person is.
We have talked about this in past.
So, the many researchers did many develop many artificial neurons.
We don't want that.
For example, let let let us try to understand, if I take single point crossover is it going to work?
In 2011, a Jeopardy! quiz show exhibition match, IBM's question answering system, Watson, defeated the two greatest Jeopardy! champions, Brad Rutter and Ken Jennings, by a significant margin.
Say we’re calculating the self-attention for the first word in this example, “Thinking”. 
No.
So, I the input unit and J hidden unit, W one IJ, W two IJ is Ith hidden unit to Jth output unit.
A state space representation is about storing information in a form that there is something called an initial state, the problem’s state in the beginning , when the problem commences the problem is in the initial state.
Now what is this?
It is not about representing a problem in state space,no.
We have also seen goal state planning where it solves everything at the problem component by component and then every component once every component is solved, it’ll check for the final that thing and if it is solved, it is so.
So, is either on the left hand side or the right hand side.
We'll explore we’ll expand the search tree as much as we can.
So, the Guided Search Methods are not something which is different than unguided, they're they are Unguided Search Methods with the use of heuristics.
okay you can't check all the permutations and combinations real time there's no panacea, there's nothing which solves all problems.
And what we do is we just apply kind of a generate and test.
And then we have seen the branch and bound search which looks at the the minimum value that we have found so far and keep a track of the new search path.
Artificial intelligence (AI) is the area of computer science which is sometimes described as machine intelligence.
Now what you have to do is to start from one node and send agents to all paths, okay .
When we try to make sure that when farmer is not around this two combination is also difficult to express in fact.
So it's not the question who can, everybody.
So, based on this, we’ll decide number of output units.
So this is an example of how you can use scripts to get answers using this cause effect relationship and there is one problem.
Again as I said, I am not going to discuss all crossover methods, we are only going to see a few useful methods which are used in TSP.
So, place on top BA requires you to move from the previous state to the current state, actually you're doing the other way round you okay but it it is to be described this way.
Then you cannot have fox and chicken both on the same side.
So, we have multiple statements with same meaning or similar meaning or same shade of meaning are are are derived into single similar representation.
So far only three guys were involved - the user, knowledge engineer, and expert.
Multi layer module means that network contains more than one module, more than one layer, okay .
In this module we'll be looking at the MiniMax algorithm.
So, there was no ontology.
Now what we do is just we just check if the first sequence is a solution, second sequence is a solution, third sequence is a solution and so on, so forth.
So that’s exactly what is happening here.
Now the parent one is A, C, B, D, E, F, G Okay and now remember the child one, we have already taken the part from parent two now the rest is to be picked up from parent one we have already talked about.
One is four, which is same so we’ll not go for that.
Missionary M two is number of missionaries on the right-side, number of cannibals on the right side.
So, that is that should have a higher heuristic value.
In in case of heuristic, value being more in in in the later cases its called hill climbing.
8,0,0, something which is already generated.
We are discussing only this.
So, I don't have much to choose from but if you look at in little more detail, if you say that if you play the first move the leftmost move, okay , we have one chance to win but that is a minimizing move.
You can see that it connects an action action with an actor okay .
We believe that the measurement that we are getting now we are very good now.
But, the point is though it looks expensive in the face of it, it is not so.
The terminating criteria is tested by calling a function call over.
Now, what is delta tau T plus one?
You require a tester who is going to test the system, who is going to write test cases and going to run once the system is developed.
Because it is already explored.
You in frames also you have attributes and their values and and there are some default values which are assumed and and so on so forth.
For example, if an an ant is travelling and it has two different paths and one with higher pheromone value, other with less pheromone value it’ll understand that more ants have travelled along this path and this path is more recent, will probably pick up that path, okay .
what you do is you just let them roam around in the real space,
We we will not fix things unless and until it is a must.
Chess is again a very, very hard problem because it contains so many moves.
It's exactly similar to a leaf node and it's treated exactly in the same fashion which is which is the next state in in the game itself.
You will have to also design implementation steps.
Now, I know that this difference because this is not C is not on the table and I want it to be on the table.
In the lexicon-based approach, the highest probable label sequence will be predicted.
The idea in post-edited machine translation is that a human corrects any obvious errors made by a machine.
Whatever you do or say that I will design classes for it, I design this different types of links and so on, so forth.
There are a lot of others, for example, run, that’s fly is also an example or drive is an example of PTRANSING , changing location, but there are other things associated, these verbs are are little more complex.
Y was free, now Y is not free okay .
It depends on the complete conceptualization ‘the friend’ depends on complete conceptualization and not either MTRANS or I.
So they are in true sense to be represented in CD form.
So, these things are important.
The one more important point, one more important component of SEF is called degree of freedom.
For example, I have three inputs A, I and H and I have I am showing three different images of A but two images of one each of I and H.
Now there is a single word ‘ate’.
So it's better if you explore everything together and in such a case, beams search is one of the best solutions.
Because the interface basically is to be used by the user and not the expert or knowledge engineer.
Minus ten is a defeat for me, ten is a win for me and the value between minus ten to ten indicates the merit of that particular state, how good or bad that state is.
It says if at(pawn, black, i,j).
But as I said, it is not necessarily a drawback, as it is going to help which nodes to be explored in the next class, next iteration.
Let us look at the first method called Partially mapped crossover.
So, that is important thing here.
And otherwise the M one minus M, now total number of missionaries on the left hand side is zero then it is fine.
So, that that is something which is different in CD and interestingly because of that different statements with the same meaning will have same representation in in conceptual that's one of the strengths of CD and there are some how it is done actually?
So six is a dead end in this case.
We have not provided any logic for it. Okay , suppose we have a choice.
If the keys are there, I’ve got the solution, I quit.
Okay .
That's that's their primary source, that’s primary job to do.
And then there is a recipient case relationship , where I is it's coming from eyes, the information is coming from eyes and going to CP , when I'm watching a match, that information is going inside my mind so that's what is done.
We are not going to address that right now.
So, the various senses the information is coming in and it is being sent to CP , okay .
Now in this particular case this maybe the best tour, if this gives me and how do you decide?
The first problem.
One more thing is that once this is done, they they look at this and understand whether problem solution should not go in wrong direction.
So out of minus five, two, minus one and minus two, two is the best node.
The the ATRANS , abstract transfer actually, it talks about mental control actually, the the control or or or ownership or position transfer.
How to get them is a hard problem.
This figure actually talks about.
Empty i,j minus two.
So, that is the best place to move.
That's the other option.
how do you do that?
The sense that our neurons are constantly dying since birth.
So, you can get this thing done.
The solution is that you try something else .
A chess board, you can have this two states.
What does that mean?
However, it has been acknowledged that reports regarding artificial intelligence have tended to be exaggerated.
Conversational channel
It just gives you an estimate, Okay and there are some mathematical ways of judging how estimate is near to the correct value and so on, so forth.
It is huge .
So, that part is done here.
One particular student implemented this to shortlist a resume in his company there are five thousand odd resumes coming in daily and what they need are bunch of experts who could look at those resumes and and filter people whom they can interview and it’s a expensive process.
If you've seen how ants find their food source, okay , how they move around and find that food source, if you have studied that process, you probably understand what I'm talking about.
Second, a clear indication of what start and end states and what are the valid states.
It can be any.
Maximum maximum value of the ch...children is passed up.
We'll We'll apply We'll have to provide this current state because unless we provide current state you will not be in a position to apply PMG to it and generate children.
Machine translation can help in situations where speed is the most important factor.
The Nanonets OCR API allows you to build OCR models with ease.
So what you can do is you can in the next cycle you can explore them before others and see how expensive they are in the next case and you can omit some of the branches, Okay .
In the beginning, usually you have a sparse neighbourhood and then you go in depth you have a a dense neighbourhood.
We’ll look at how it happens in this particular module.
This path is obviously longer than one that I’ve already found.
And here, Farmer Fox Chicken Grain problem.
Okay .
Now, this information is to be provided to the back propagation neural network.
So you can even take that case the first node, second node, third node, fourth node, the last node then the node itself.
Recognizing somebody is one example.
So, that is one of the very, very important part of prototype, this thing and expert and knowledge engineer sit together and do lot of things.
In the second step we’ll evaluate those states.
Now the the first condition done, but the other one A is resting on top of B okay that becomes when you put A on the table, A is resting on B becomes false.
The cyclic crossover is little different so I have chosen a longer to make sure you understand.
And today as I said, there is something called Deep Learning which is happening where you have lot of layers and there is a modified algorithm.
Neural network, also we use small neurons, which can work together to solve complex problems.
If it is a goal state, quit.
So from every node, every city you have a distance to every other city.
Why?
The goal stack planning or GSP as I've told you earlier, is using this, component by component, pick up each component, putting on the stack and solve it.
And why it is darkened?
In our case, it's pretty simple.
Now, it is quite possible and when when the speaker begins with a phrase or two, it is possible that the meaning of statement is possibly in three different directions.
So, this is the other example which neural network program can solve.
Basically, it is represented by Propel is physically physical force and also PTRANS, okay .
For example when number of missionaries are less than number of cannibals you cannot accept that state.
So, let us start talking about them. The first step here is prototype construction and conceptualization.
So, won't prepare that dinner Okay .
If all three consecutive states all three consecutive cells are occupied by opponent, it is minus ten.
Unlike Depth-first search where you try going in the left until you are stuck, here we have an artificial limit.
The candidates for that thing so, they’re best actually and so we’re we’re always looking at best nodes.
The other one are the links, those links are are known as dependencies and very rightly so, because it talks about how one object is dependent on the other one.
So you just provide your and basically the heuristic is based on a simple method.
Data security often comes up when discussing machine translation.
When it is omitted it is the default value is is Milkha Singh himself.
Here, we have three missionaries and three cannibals on one side of a river.
There is no algorithm that you can talk about.
So, two raised to five you can have total thirty two combinations which can which is good for for example, all zeros will be one, all zeros but the last one is B and all zero but the fourth one is C and so on, so forth.
If we use the same string surprisingly both children comes out to be the same.
It just sum things up and just check for the threshold or zero value.
We’ll never get two values which are equal.
I'm I’m having two consecutive Xs in line so the next move I can win.
When the errors are propagated back, the weights are adjusted accordingly which we discussed in a previous module.
For instance, your chatbot can ask a user if they are looking for a flat to buy or rent, and then display an offer relevant to their response.
One is farmer, two is fox, four is chicken and eight is grain.
Machine translation engines can produce the same quality as a human translator for a few text types only.
Now, let us look at this back propagation network.
Okay , you can see P indicating past tense, Okay .
So, fine.
For example, in case of G, okay , you also have here you have a horizontal line.
So, it's basically a recursive process. And that's the reason why stack is used.
okay He might also say that the system is to be redesigned because now he has learned everything and he can suggest that this is the mistake that I made and I’d like to improve on it.
If you know how to do that, does a a as I've already discussed that thing in the previous module that there is something called heuristic which can help us.
We don't really know.
It should generate the children.
So if it is winning for us, losing for us or a draw, we have already seen these those three cases.
They they are dependent on each other and that is being used as an instrument.
Now this is called Breadth first search.
When mental information is being transferred, MTRANS is used and we'll see some examples about how to how to use this form.
The function which gets me that is called neighbourhood function.
So if you're going down, down, down, and you it is quite possible that you allow a bad move and move to a little worse state but you still have remembered the good state, so you can always go back to that state.
A lot of long back in even long back in Sixties, computer scientists who were working on such problems understood that these problems are different, they are not similar problems.
The weights of each the each of these important things how important threat of fork is, how important center control is based on which some quantification is made and you get those values.
Nothing bad about, nothing wrong about that.
N and D then you choose N not D.
The first step in calculating self-attention is to create three vectors from each of the encoder’s input vectors (in this case, the embedding of each word). 
Now, later on when the speaker utters something else, which which prohibits one of the branches, other two branches can still be explored.
The users are denying, users are denied of their services.
‘First Jay went to watch the match.
And remember, we have chosen six plies in our example based on many things.
For example, if you have seven that is seven minus one factorial, six factorial, okay that is seven twenty.
There is no central authority, unlike computer processors.
Okay the algorithm is pretty simple.
In this post, we will attempt to oversimplify things a bit and introduce the concepts one by one to hopefully make it easier to understand to people without in-depth knowledge of the subject matter.
The first prerequisite is a it works In fact back propagation is used in many forms in many places .
It allows chatbots to perform tasks that would normally require human intelligence, like decision making, language translation, or speech recognition.
With this we’ll come to an end of this module.
Rule number twelve, okay .
And for Tic Tac Toe let us look at some of the characteristics.
It might contain number of variables, it might contain number of conditions.
Because if I for example I say that any two children that is going to be huge , not only that any number of changes, I have a huge value.
Let’s begin by looking at the model as a single black box.
Check if the precondition pre previous state is relevant.
With that we come to an end of this module.
We begin from L three three, R zero zero and BL.
In our case, it is It’ll Here I've taken L.
User: I would like to order coffee.
But again theoretically if you want a proof that the problem is given will surely solve, that is not possible.
But remember what we need to do is what we need to do for positively misclassified and negatively misclassified.
For example, I have parent one as A, C, B, D, E, F, G and parent two as C, D, B, G, A, E, F Okay and I decide that I use the middle three elements, in the case number one, the parent one is B, D, E, parent two is B, G, A Okay .
So, that means great.
Now, one interesting rule that comes next is that sometimes the act inflicts the state change.
not all experts agree on either components, neither the weights.
I’m actually incrementing the heuristic value.
Machine translation can also be used to translate PowerPoint presentations, intranet bulletins, and other similar documents.
It says that the next block is empty.
Product reviews can be easily translated into another language.
The second one.
Okay , let us start talking about the the abstract, the first primitive, okay .
So, point is just this.
If I have five nodes and for example if you combine one and five and generate a new solution or new two new solutions basically think of it,
For example, there is there is something called zero zero. Let us begin.
which I where the solution can be found is pretty useful. And there is something, I call Hierarchical Generate and Test.
General purpose would be almost impossible because it has to be generic.
We know that the same parent, same city cannot be revisited, so we are ignoring them, we are cutting them off. Okay .
Filters let you also show specific info to people who come to your website using a specific URL address.
This version is significantly more accurate on the unstructured text as well.
So, anything multiplied by zero will be zero, so, xi wi case all xi is where the xi value is zero, wi does not make any contribution to the summation.
Now, you can find that this information provided in this statement is something which is different than the the script itself.
One hidden layer The idea of having a hidden layer is to provide some means of finding out features of the input.
A simple example of an algorithm is the following (optimal for first player) recipe for play at tic-tac-toe:
Because start says the first state, zero is the depth and zero is the player who is playing.
So this alpha and beta cut-offs are also applied to MiniMax in most cases which improves the the algorithm further.
For example, I'm I'm I’m at a typical place in in in eight, zero eight, five, three gallon water jug problem.
You just explore your children, apply heuristic function and pick up, Okay sorry.
You can see that ‘Sachin flew to LA.’
Okay so, that's the only difference, otherwise it's it’s the same okay .
But the other case which we’ll we see next is that something happening and using which this thing is the other conceptualization.
In the initial chess movement, for example, youre youre moving across, you won't look at all moves okay .
What is to be added?
Now, that knowledge is to be be be completely modeled into a computer program that KE and developer is is the communication is pretty, pretty critical here and it constructs actually a lot of other important outcome.
Okay , so technically there is no difference.
We’d like to have a better heuristic value so we’ll not move further.
It is a valid state.
And finally, we'll write this and why this is written the the lower part of on this is complete goal description.
Now we’ll have to plan one after the other.
So what a translator program will do is explore all these three branches together .
These are called motivational strategies.
The next few years would later be called an AI winter, a period when obtaining funding for AI projects was difficult.
Many times, the things look pretty complex on the face of it.
This way, information can be distributed to a considerably wider target audience within the company.
So, one way to do that is to use a state space representation and that's exactly what we are going to do, next.
But here in this case, two is the best node, so we’ll explore two.
The same thing is happening here.
But that is not going to be the case in most complicated problems.
Obviously, what we want to do is to save the king leave everything, else be sacrificed for it.
So, again, three-prong structure is used.
The manoeuvering process itself is called search.
In fact testing, that’s what testing is.
A landmark publication in the field was the 1989 book Analog VLSI Implementation of Neural Systems by Carver A. Mead and Mohammed Ismail.
So, you can use one which suits you.
Please understand these values like fuzzy logic depends on context.
So when you talk about entry conditions, they are conditions that must be satisfied for invocation of that state.
So we like to increase that , in the other this thing we will like to reduce total amount of distance covered.
Okay , go back to next city okay .
In this particular module, we looked at conceptualization, prototype construction, then we've looked at formalization, then we have looked at the implementation and then we have looked at the testing part of the expert system design.
You don't have that knowledge stored in expert’s mind or KE’s mind that is to be verbalized, and this is the the other part.
The row which we discussed, in fact we can assume it to be part of summation, is again very simple, what we are doing is x one w one plus x two w two x three w three and so on.
It’s a nine into nine matrix.
Are there any restrictions?
It’s as simple as the previous one.
okay So, that's exactly happening next.
What what are the possible candidates and you'll just look at the them and check them which matches they they’ll just give you the Dendral, the output of the Dendral is small side of states which matches.
We don't really know.
Our search is an associative way is one more.
okay And B L or B R, B L means boat on the left side and boat on the right side.
Now I've already got five which is very good.
The first layer and you can say W one prefixes always, okay .
So, multiple statements having Ram loves Sita, Ram found Sita loving and so on so forth can be represented using a single statement.
When you do something in your mind, conceive an idea or or build something within your mind, it is called MBUILD , that is represented by a primitive called MBUILD .
So you pick up four, again, pick up all all children are four, five, six and four.
Because of that the ordinal representation makes it faster.
That that's a problem, okay .
And the disadvantage of the second player, we've already seen the previous module that the last slide of the previous module talked about the the second player will not have some chances.
So, we we look back at our own that thing and and we’re we very happy to learn that our logic is still there, we dig that thing out and put that thing into the code and that worked.
The other ant also starts spraying the pheromone along the same path and it'll add to the the amount of pheromone and what does that mean?
The case where you already these two are dead end. okay We can't proceed further.
We can we are looking at a cricket match and you see a side face of a friend and you recognize him.
Yeah .
User: Anna.
Today’s machine translation systems can help with companies’ internal and, in some cases, external communication – at least when the text they produce is reviewed before publication.
Others believe that AI, unlike previous technological revolutions, will create a risk of mass unemployment.
So what we do?
It’s a little different than the normal general script.
Okay , so those are preconditions or entry conditions they are something called props which are the objects involved in this here it is tickets and seat and match and so on so forth.
So six is not allowed .
I’ll be talking about that in due course.
The critic, the person who is going to evaluate is is also an expert but then is not the same He is going to validate this model.
With that we’ll conclude.
Also in the case of endgame you do that.
Now expert obviously has given his knowledge.
Now the beauty of choosing these value can be seen in the next three next two statements.
That's what I was talking about when I say when I said that the CD captures the meaning and represents the meaning rather than the words themselves.
So some value is decremented okay over over the period of time plus whatever is added by newly new ants which travels down that path.
So, people started thinking that neural networks cannot solve this problem.
You have two white pawns here, but the lowermost pawn, you can see that the importance of it.
So, that is again an example.
Previous state equal to current state minus A dot additions and union , now it is union because there may be a few things which are repeated.
L okay , the next one is N and D.
It is possible to have multiple hidden layers.
I what I do is I pick up a root node, explore all children of it, next level explore all children of those children and so and so forth that is the Breadth-first search.
Remember the higher value of T will let you move to a worse state with more probability than less.
Genetic Algorithms is is is a method of solving problems based on how life forms persist.
it is quite possible that you you get children all of them having lesser value than the parent and you can’t move forward, that is steepest ascent that is the local maxima problem.
So somehow BDC is used.
So, now when there is a dead end the last parent will explore its right child.
Now, let us take one more action called place on top.
Their work they are working in a coordinated way and the pheromone value is an indicator, the the tool which they use for coordination here, okay .
The third step obviously goes ahead and calls the MiniMax for its children.
In in case where backtracking is impossible, for example, chess.
okay Functional description of each module this module is going to do that, okay , objectives and the problems, okay , objectives and the challenges of every every module that you will are going to work on.
And initially it it was considered to be a very good thing unless somebody found there was a guy called Minsky who found that however good this neural networks are, they are incapable of solving some problems, which are we which he called non -linearly separable problems.
The idea is about using a very small tiny agent with very little information, little processing power but able to do things which are unable to do by many other things, very, very simple solutions which are parallel.
You don't invoke that script.
And usually, it most of the neural networks use three layers but the recent trend is to use many, many layers, hundreds of layers.
I have two strings.
Now, this is something very similar to which we have seen in the in the beginning, when we discussed about static evaluation function.
A simple a single state space can be represented in multiple ways, a the same same way the rules also can be written multiple ways.
We start from A then explore and okay what are the trees, what are the cities possible to be reached?
Okay a very similar thing is not only time but a place. I saw a match in Nagpur.
You can see that Nobita INGEST because he is eating rice ‘eat’ is represented as INGEST sorry and the object is rice, double arrow as usual because it is past tense P but that is used as an instrument.
And what we get at the end, you can see that I get two different answers.
Now, every input, every input of A will be nine into nine, total eighty one we’ll use okay .
So, this is something that we do not want.
We want all missionaries to move from left side to right side, okay .
So many things to store.
And in this case, the exploration seems fruitless because eventually I get all four of my children having value N, looks quite similar but it is in true sense, they are not.
SEF returns the winning chances for player one, not player two.
Now, it is quite possible that Abdul is a person who is looking for a job and Rajan is a placement consultant or he's a smuggler and Rajan Rajan is a smuggler and Abdul is good at motorboats and so on so forth.
I’ve already told earlier that however simple this looks like the block’s world problem can be pretty useful for robots to work.
So temperature value is reduced .
Anyway so let us see what this particular rule is doing.
In fact, TSP what you want to get is the same node back.
So, you can see there are four steps shown on the slide which which does just that okay , and just go back.
They travel along their own generated path but then there are two outgoing lines for the third ant.
It is indicating time.
Remember the tour cost for example, in this case, one ABCD is so far two twenty plus two fifty plus one fifty that is six twenty.
It can actually learn on its own, can look at names of names which it cannot understand, ask user, learn about them, place them in the database and so on, so forth.
And many a times it happens that both of them take various case studies and see how expert solves that case.
What is deleted?
Because, we’re not reached to the final goal state.
Now this is a small story that is presented to the problem solver using this thing script.
When you say ‘ran fast’, it it the fast does not add to the entire conceptualization.
MiniMax algorithm is one of the oldest algorithms of game playing.
There's few there are few things which are worth pointing out.
You can see that and I I I bold face them to make sure that you have understand.
Okay , there is something called steepest ascent hill climbing, which is a little different than the hill climbing, Okay .
Depth first iterative deepening works like that.
Okay you know that it is quite true for us as well.
By completely filling this and rest escaping here and and the eight nine and so on, you can you can read these remaining rules yourself and you can see that they are completely self-explanatory, Okay .
They won’t start from initial state and reach to final state.
and and it inherits from parents to children,
State space is about representing the problem in a computer understandable form.
Recombination, now those five are to be matted together; recombine together to produce next generation that is called recombination.
Nine into nine matrix and I want to recognize A.
So, we will not be exploring that here.
Okay So, if you can do that, what is the advantage?
So what we have is this.
So, testing is comparatively more difficult.
So, that is representation as the E okay Effect link. So, you can see that.
I don't feel like that.
It's it’s not that easy.
The parent one is A, C, B, D, E, F, G out of that we will copy the middle three elements B, D and E in the child.
So, everybody understand about that system, their own role and what they expect from others, what other expects from them in a very clear terms.
So over might return, come back when we reach the six ply.
The third rule is talking about a case, when Y plus Z is is less than five.
And why this sparse?
Entities
And and the events are connected to each other.
Now you can see that what we are talking about is almost hill climbing, otherwise best so far is current node.
And, that’s why it is represented in in a little darker fashion.
So, this one zero to n only includes the ants which travelled along that path and no other ants.
It can be used in combination with any text recognition method.
It it first, it begins with similarities and differences between start and goal states.
And I'm I’m talking about a very simple case.
So conceptualization and putting it into a proper form which experts can also view and once the expert views it, he will be able to validate that.
So, progression and regression are quite important thing for planning and there is one more thing which is called relevant.
Let me tell you that GA is a huge thing and what I am going to talk about is just we are just going to scratch the surface.
Implementation planning comes next.
If I have this function I can just apply to a state and get that value and get that value between minus ten and ten and I’ll look at all possible alternatives.
C is what?
So, both things are used.
If I have N it is thirty-five raised to N number of moves I'll have to apply, evaluate them for that particular case for a single move every time .
Now we’re not looking at the children.
Now the answer is that what we do is we’ll reduce the weights of every case where xi is non-zero.
It is able to solve lot of problems for example recently Google provided a solution, you you you just look at the image and can ask for something which is otherwise is just impossible.
You can see that it is not C is not resting on the table.
You can say yes, yes great
For example, I have A, B and C.
It says if farmer is on the right side Fx and Ch cannot be on the left side okay and Ch and grain also cannot be on the left side.
And as I said, the algorithms are not fool-proof, the algorithm may not correctly classify.
The produced predictions which could be rotated rectangles or quadrangles are further processed through the non-maximum-suppression step to yield the final output.
One more primitive is called INGEST, taking something from outside.
Unwinding start in the last function, in the chain and then comes back.
Once we have detected the bounding boxes having the text, the next step is to recognize text.
But it is assumed to be there.
So, this actually, the third move you can see that C is better than B and B is better than A.
With free, publicly available machine translation services, there is a risk that the translated text will remain in the translation engine’s memory.
That's point which I wanted to stress.
If you pick up some other strings you probably have different mapping and you will have to do it.
And the most complex thing is that when there are multiple rules possible, there are not one, two, three, four rules are possible, which one should I choose?
So, you may look at them and let me recap what we have done in this particular module.
We say that at R Fr which is very clear.
Okay to the same statement that we've seen in in in case of rule one is represented here as as an additional.
Hearing few words of music and recollecting the entire song is the other.
Same as hill climbing, nothing different.
It's an excellent idea in fact.
Why we do that?
Minus five, two, minus one and two are yet to be explored .
We'll talk about that.
Y is less than or equal to five.
So, you can look at the next slide.
Look at this.
Even if English was chosen as the company’s official language, not everyone may be able to use it, at least well enough.
So, people are working on it, but there is no solution yet.
It's called ‘After the match gets over Jay went to his friend's house.’
And you can see after arrow, we have L M one minus M, C three minus C, what does it mean?
If it is not a leaf node, the function proceed further.
If KE might look at different alternatives and decide the best one and it is quite possible that KE might probably have not understood what expert has said.
There is a figure nine point one in the handout as well as in the PPT which clearly visualizes what I just talked about and this is called three three two network.
The need to translate them is often urgent.
But, while going through it at some point or on the other we realize that we we quite accurate, we're very good, we can come back and for which, we have written a function call over.
Machine translation can be used in many ways, for instance, to follow the development of one’s field of expertise and to obtain competition-related information.
clears nose First time, we have already seen generating a state space.
So we can get a tour with lowest value.
Best first, remember the word best first means that we’re only exploring best nodes , Okay .
And there are lot of problems like recognizing a face, recognizing a signature.
Think of it.
What I can do is I can use a an action called place on top or place on table and use that and once I do that the prerequisite is done.
As soon as the person completes the sentence, it is to be translated and and delivered to the participant.
Knowledge representation scheme also is to be provided in big detail and provide clear cut idea about how and how the knowledge is represented and how it is inferred and so on and so forth.
We like to explore a search space much faster and real time. So well well use sparse neighbourhood.
So, there is an arrow which indicates so.
The other one, which one of my student did in his project, is is, he was working for a place where lot of resumes flowing in daily.
When you try solving on BA, what you need is free B which is not there okay .
We’ll begin with something called Variable neighbourhood descent.
The first part how to write this function actually depends on the domain .
But when we talk about mutation is about making sure that there is some real random inheritance takes place.
This basically is derived from a area which is quite unrelated to artificial intelligence, called metallurgy.
So it it’s very important that you provide right set of samples, right set of images.
So we’ll choose the child with highest heuristic value that’s why it’s called steepest ascent.
What is a branching factor?
You'll have to manage uncertainty.
For example, when you encounter raining and match abandoned kind of a thing then obviously viewing does not happen or happy or sad, obviously you are sad because you can't watch so you you can understand that thing Okay ?
In fact, if you have played Tic Tac Toe yourself, the best move is to occupy the center in the beginning, why because you have degree of freedom.
There is no relation of that sort.
A Simulated hill climbing is a method where sorry simulated annealing actually. Simulated annealing is is basically a superset of hill climbing that we've seen in the earlier module which allows some random movements in in the other direction.
The next level is thirty five into thirty five into thirty five minus whatever you’ve explored so far.
He answered, India has won the toss and invited South Africa to bat.
I know that in the beginning I have to send two cannibals on the other side, I did that.
So, the the very statement does not contain anything about bullet or gun or something but but the representation contains them.
You don't require expert for it.
Chatbot builder
That’s the first step.
And if it’s not there I’ll look at my table drawer and if it’s not there I’ll search for my daughter, Okay .
okay The algorithm we have designed returns two things.
we are now into twenty ninth module of AI .
Okay how see how it is done.
And the components are very simple design, obviously, because it doesn't do much - spraying pheromone, calculating value of pheromone and deciding.
So, what you could do is, you can say that the pheromone value for the next segment next period is equal to older pheromone value multiplied by one minus row.
That’s a problem.
‘Forget’ is exactly opposite to it, something which was part of the long term memory is gone out, hear, tell, okay and so on, so forth.
So, there is no way to represent high level context.
GA is about searching in solution space.
Mahesh.
Before that calling, every every statement that is a key booted in this particular function will be executed before that call is.
For example, there are actors, so Sachin gave his bat to Sarfaraz then Sachin is an actor and and the ATRANS is is is the primitive now, that Sachin and ATRANS have some relation, that relation is to be like written and that is called dependency.
It can be triggered when the user’s problem goes beyond the chatbot’s scope.
We have we say that L A B C D, e R E F G H okay and then say A plus E is equal to one.
You can see that we we have some, we have to have some qualities to survive and those who have better qualities have better chances of survival
Corresponding element of H is C and C appears at position number three, so they that is added Okay you can see; a position that appears in child one now. Okay .
So G is replaced by D. Okay .
Now, that is going to be troublesome.
We begin with 8,0,0.
How the pheromone values are?
With that note, we'll end this module.
Chicken.
And the very, very important if the expert feels so and the knowledge engineer feels so, if both of them are in sync or they are not.
You get the machine translation almost immediately for your use.
Now what I do, I just copy rest as it is and what I get is this, this four, okay .
You did that because you could associate this information and search in associative way.
There are hundred, almost infinite number of other ways to represent this problem.
But then when you use this script the appropriate script you can reason like nothing before.
We will see which crossover methods that we are going to use.
So, what you have to do is to reduce the temperature as fast as possible without affecting the stableness of the result, okay , and that actually there is no formula.
So, it’s is a single structure which contain actually the essence of multiple scripts, Okay .
It belongs to a a a specific class you just run some testing, measurements and letter.
The entry conditions I have talked about the locations,People involved,object involved and the results and all that they are all all all mention in the explicitly at now which was not mention in the orignal statement okay .
In fact, it is possible for a neural network to solve any problem it can learn.
The field of AI research was born at a workshop at Dartmouth College in 1956, where the term Artificial Intelligence was coined by John McCarthy to distinguish the field from cybernetics and escape the influence of the cyberneticist Norbert Wiener.
The typing delay is a scrollbar that enables you to set up how fast your chatbot should respond to user input.
You know such programs were just impossible a few years back.
Mahesh throws a stone and that is an object to to hurt Jayesh.
Sentiment analysis
Whenever these three features exist.
Now that node maybe maybe little bad that that node may may not be as good as it looks at the first shot.
So, there is no so you've deleted something which is not part of the goal state so second condition is also satisfied.
okay .
Chess-playing programs usually have time associated so it says that you have five minutes, in five minutes you'll have to find out whatever you can.
If a company is operating in several countries or on several continents even, communication becomes more difficult to manage.
Obviously, two abilities of deer can save.
So, the every line has two components, xi and wi.
Same way, the output unit all inputs all hidden units connected to it, they are they are all multiplied, HY WY, HI WIJ, In fact IJ if this is the Jth unit, HI JI, H one J J , assume this is J clears nose .
And then M one plus M M two is three and C one plus C two is also three.
where we we can see that even even a trivial problem like travelling salesman result into a serious combinatorial explosion.
Whats the annealing schedule?
These characters and their fates raised many of the same issues now discussed in the ethics of artificial intelligence.
These are indications, okay , these are symptoms of something which is wrong.
So, every domain has the jargon associated with it.
In the next module, we are going to look at a script, something which addresses the lacuna that we have seen here.
I’ve already told you ten is the solution, Okay , so that’s why it’s called hill climbing.
They don’t HAVE to be smaller, this is an architecture choice to make the computation of multiheaded attention (mostly) constant.
You try to explore all possible states and you become more conscious about In a way you're applying dense neighbourhood function even when the situation becomes critical.
The best applying that thing will get us best static evolution function value and that will pass up by and that's quite interesting.
One more method is to pick up depth-first search, we only pick up one typical branch of the tree and explore it continuously and come to a dead end, we take up the next branch and so and so forth.
Documentation and instructions
When better quality is needed
It’s a toolset that lets apps communicate with other services and enables developers to integrate new apps into existing software.
But the rest as I have said you can use that heuristic to find out the path which is there.
We have everything on the left hand side.
One is called the Ontological memory which, remember this was a problem with the the CD as well as script.
Where Y plus Z is less than three. Total amount of milk in Y and Z is less than three, then what you can do is you can pour everything in in in this , the the three gallon jug.
M one C one is number of missionaries and number of cannibals and obviously indicates and, R indicates right , the right side.
Let us take a simpler example. It’s not all that simple, but comparatively simpler example of playing chess.
You can see that in the initial movements, first four movements, we are not actually moving missionaries.
Machine translation is an excellent choice in situations where having the materials translated by a human translator would be too large an investment.
So that’s that's what I’m doing in fact.
What we are going to talk about is preliminary, a few basic things about neural networks.
Tesseract was originally developed at Hewlett-Packard Laboratories between 1985 and 1994.
Now think of the state that he he he has to look at; ceiling above the floor, there's a floor beneath, there are objects around in the in the room, chair, sofa, lights, so on .
What will be the terminating criteria for the we we already seen that the time obviously is one.
They can't think of it.
One characteristic is highest value of win and least value of using losing.
Same way, D and E.
That is the meaning B plus F is two that means one of them is zero.
Assume that robot is moving around in in a room.
For example A, B, C, D, E, F, G is one tour and A, C, B, D, E, F, G is another tour.
I've already talked about two cases chess and robot domain and even car automated car domain where this is just impossible .
So capacity of Y is five so you can have five or less and Z less than or equal to three .
But the other yes, an an important here is representation of the state, the mental state - sad and happy.
Welcome friends, to thirty fifth module of AI .
So, I'm I'm not or for example, there are twenty moves and Ill just choose two.
Important.
Now let us look at the next level.
It is also important that all parties are aware of the use of machine translation.
Okay , So, what we do now?
I can move to eight,zero,zero, .
Now this is basically moving to that state with the probability P because if you use a good heuristic function, good random number generator between zero and one it is equally probable each number is equally probable.
And that is the reason why this depth-first iterative deepening is is used with chess.
You just pick up next city from the list of cities.
So second cycle.
And exactly opposite is regression.
And the algorithm is shown here.
So, I'll pick up that child, the third one, if I'm doing it.
okay so new twenty, now new twenty is pick up five and throw everything.
So this is how I can apply heuristic function and get the move that I should choose rather than exploring all of them like breadth-first or exploring one branch and then the second branch and the third branch like DFS.
So total amount of milk is less than 5 gallons.
So, state change is inflicted by that acting, okay .
You can also use the Nanonets-OCR- API by following the steps below:
So, we we have a question mark there and this is again, remember, the question mark is an important this thing here, okay .
The other one is losing and a third one is a draw.
So that is the meaning of this particular rule.
Now this thing which we have looked at is very, very important.
And what it comes out with, is the value, Okay , how good or bad but ten, minus ten to ten in conventional way but you can design your own way.
You can see that Sachin is clever.
okay So, for that I I have that value and also the path from where I am connecting, what's the exact path and what's the heuristic value of that particular path.
This insight, that digital computers can simulate any process of formal reasoning, is known as the Church–Turing thesis.
But then, there is a limit also.
Text detection techniques required to detect the text in the image and create and bounding box around the portion of the image having text.
The root node is 8,0,0 or initial node. Now what we do now is we apply all possible rules and generate all possible states which can be generated from eight in the next level.
But when the situation becomes critical, what will you do?
ok The initial state in case of chess, all of us know what that initial state is, that is passed to.
A good example of texts with a short life cycle is that of product review texts at online stores.
You can see that there is a threat from knight to the king.
okay The over function thus returns the structure okay So, node infrastructure which is very important for us .
So, C is the first, so we copy C here, Okay .
Even if you don’t know it’s still Okay .
So, this process , the algorithm which does all this, it the algorithm tells how you calculate the hind layer, that’s called activation, how what it what flows from the middle layer to the final layer and so on, so forth.
So, let's talk about.
Based on that we pass the value up.
What I'm going to talk about is how one can represent a statement in a CD form.
In these cases, it is a good idea to classify products into more and less important ones, so that human quality assurance can be added for the translations of the most important products, if necessary.
What is the value?
The seven-step solution.
Many a times, the neurons appear in multiple layers.
It is also a great benefit that machine translation can be used to easily translate texts that would otherwise not be translated at all, such as email messages.
clears nose Okay so farmer cannot be on the both side.
Sachin gifted a bat to Sarfaraz, also will have that.
Thank you
Now the ants will again start travelling from the very node.
So, if you want to write a general purpose problem solver for chess it’s very, very hard it’s almost impossible.
We’ll look closer at self-attention later in the post.
Static evolution function is also assumed to be existing we don't write, define any static evolution function here and we'll we'll see that there is something on alpha-beta pruning.
Looking at the results, the candidate structures are are calculated and checked for a match, Okay .
It is pretty simple and can also be be used in embedded devices, IoT devices and many other devices, which which doesn’t have the the power or computation power or memory to process all all these. Okay .
The question that one may ask is this branch and bound is great.
How important is is a combination of knight and rook and something like that.
That is the important problem.
We have already seen that.
This rule number six we are talking about a case where there is something which is happening, and it is using something else as the instrument for doing it.
‘Manoj had a chocolate.
Because that domain is more unstructured and probably this thing , the system itself is less structured as well.
Now G is to be mapped to D.
So, this is how you can define a state space, you can have initial and final state, you can define moves and how you apply most to solve a problem.
That's the issue.
So > now look at the middle part.
You may use the better represent.
In the beginning , will start with start state zero zero.
First thing, we need a data structure for storing the state.
Now, you're also going to add us a policy enforcer.
When knowledge is redundant, we have a problem.
What what is what is the pheromone value that an ant add?
So, some information about Deep Blue is provided.
In short you can use moves to move around in state space and reach to the solution.
Now carefully look at how the solution is achieved.
It's very likely that the third ant will follow this path.
Okay , a particular sequence which may be the right answer to this missionary cannibal problem.
Anyway, there are two two questions that you’d probably ask before we proceed further.
Okay for example, I'm I'm Im using a depth first search.
I would better evaluate this position of the state in little more detail, a little more elaborated fashion.
Though all of them are cricket matches and most of the things remain same. There is some difference.
Because, as I said, you begin with random set of weights.
Every road is is possible to travel in both directions, okay that’s a reverse path is the same path.
The inputs come from this side and flows through this layers and then goes out from the last layer.
The resulting cost is often considered too high.
One is advantage that I've talked about multiple times is that multiple statements.
If anything less than that, what’s the point?
You may get the child two in a similar fashion and this is how the order crossover works.
Specific decisions like whether I'll be using rule based expert system or whether I'm going to use fuzzy system or whatever will be decided here.
So, more number of samples.
You can even control that thing that that's why that method is better.
In fact, when there is the rule is pretty specific, the prerequisites are pretty specific, simple.
Simple, you cut some part of the string and paste some part elsewhere and the other one you apply fitness function to the string finding out how good or fit this particular string is.
That makes it fourteen , that also is not allowed.
So they are part of the unexplored nodes.
We can say that H one equal to why it is one, because X zero is always one, into W one zero one.
you just get five best solutions and then then mingle them in a way that you get twenty better solutions and then again pick up five, and so and so forth.
Remember that plausible move generator is is based on a given game. okay .
You cannot pour it out.
This function calls some other function.
if you taken a path, you can't come back.
okay we are looking at the prerequisites see that, Look at this.
But then at level one I don't get much information this the the heuristic or static evaluation function are just estimates and I go near to the goal I get better estimate.
okay Who’d , you describe the problem in complete detail as much as you can.
So thats about simulated annealing.
We need an additional thing in solving an AI problem called search .
So, this is the artificial neuron also is designed exactly in that fashion.
You you shouldn't have very large number of components because it’s going to reduce the the search time.
There is a guy who is administering administering everything, an administrator.
So, is there is no match here.
So, these are this is a new state.
There are few rules there and also the way one can represent a complex statement into CD .
For example, when I'm talking about bank and if the context is financial, you know that it’s a financial institute which lends money, allows me to have an account and then withdraw and deposit money and so on so forth.
If necessary, post-editing can be ordered for selected important texts, so that a human translator edits the machine translation into a more refined form.
[citation needed] These learners could therefore derive all possible knowledge, by considering every possible hypothesis and matching them against the data.
When we study heuristics, we’ll study it further but here let me tell you why it is not so.
There is something which stores the current state, there has to be something which stores the current state.
What does that mean? You pour milk from eight gallon jug to five gallon jug and pour it back .
He can he can walk twenty kilometers without a problem.
The issue is synchronization.
So, that doesn't happen in conventional systems, but it does here.
And using that we’ll have a far better estimates of the next move that we are going to take.
We’ve already seen that there is possibility of using something called blind search methods like kit generation test, breadth-first search, depth-first search to handle the search problem.
So, okay , once the tentative plan is ready, you can start with actual implementation.
You may traverse a very long path and get a solution, it’s pro probably if you’d have traversed on the other side probably you’ll get it much earlier, but that’s it.
It is x zero w zero plus x one w one and so on and it is greater than zero, then it fires, less than zero, it does not.
A translation of the text can be obtained quickly and in a form that enables the recipients to understand the core content of the message.
Because, is the opponent is going to play and there is an alternate equal I available which opponent can play which is which leads to almost defeat for us minus nine.
And what is the amount of memory that you need?
For example, this thing Mahesh hurt Jayesh by throwing stones.
But here it is not possible in square.
for an example I've already given later part of the game when it's pretty crucial.
Not farmer.
So, either one or two person can carry that boat.
Now on the other side, you can see that not D and not C is about the other side okay .
But simple.
So, in fact, in this case Sachin and ATRANS dependent on each other.
So, if you reach to a state which is not acceptable or when you reach to a move which is not acceptable only because it is impossible using the move to move from one this state to this state.
Because knowledge is updated in one place, the other place is not and you have a problem, the whole chaotic situation derives out of this problem.
okay So when we reach there what should I be doing?
Why that static evaluation function is needed and all that also we’ll be looking at in this particular module.
Okay , You probably have heard about professional chess playing programs and something if you if you if you read computer related information, probably you have heard about Garry Kasparov being beaten by a computer built by IBM engineers.
So, technically it is sound enough.
These are is is is present in the image.
That’ll add a lot of chaotic things, okay .
Okay .
So, if that exists then this structure cannot be the the the real one, so that is eliminated.
Okay .
How number of inputs and output unit and the hidden unit are decided?
That is quite possible in case of expert system.
Remember, if you explore more promising paths first, it is better for us because we'll be able to eliminate the paths which are non-optimal, okay .
okay The other example
If it is not phi that means you’ve deleted something which is part of the goal state.
So you can sacrifice your queen to kill that pawn in in in some cases.
We have also seen what are the what are the challenges in this.
And the other one is described an action aider.
It begins with the first element, Okay .
We are changing states component by component, we changed one component, second, third.
Now, looking at this description, let us see whether this particular state, whether these states are valid or invalid.
We are into twentieth module of AI and we'll be discussing about some prerequisites for the MiniMax algorithm to be applied and a few other algorithms also, the prerequisites are just fine.
Now, the statement does not indicate that store but the If you have an ontology, probably you can have that.
You can see that now, two is the best this thing .
ok the like hill climbing or simulated annealing or something similar.
You surveilling something, okay , then something is happening and you will have to take an action based on it.
We may end up on a dead end because you explore only two and there are no both of them are dead ends, okay .
Some systems implicitly or explicitly use multiple of these approaches, alongside many other AI and non-AI algorithms; the best approach is often different depending on the problem.
Now you can see is is something quite similar in the next slide.
And the only thing is that you represent anything that comes across, divide into pieces, and represent that thing as a very, very low-level primitives.
‘Anjali cried’.
When you do that in in case of refinem…this thing the branch and bound that thing is known as the refinement search.
So, it cannot even solve that problem.
Patient, doctor, whatever. Relation between those classes, which classes are a superclass, which class is a subclass and which class is used by others and so on, so forth.
that's what it is.
With a branching factor of thirty five chess is an example, at level number one you have thirty five.
That is done.
But technically there's no difference.
That should be non-phi but it is phi.
So, in fact, you may see that why the hidden unit is provided?
Now, this is something which is heuristic.
Remember why?
Better offspring offspring have more chances of survival and then next generation is genetically better. Okay
But then there is a problem.
So, these are also points that one must learn but it is very interesting how back propagation manages it.
AI's founders were optimistic about the future: Herbert Simon predicted, machines will be capable, within twenty years, of doing any work a man can do.
That method is pretty good if you're able to use your heuristics better, okay .
Remember, the static evaluation function or heuristic, is only an estimate and I have just played my own move, I have not seen what opponent is up to.
So, that's the reason why what you need to do is to re-run the program.
You might be surprised that what is it like and when you represent health equal to minus ten and ten it doesn't really represent the the the mental state of a person.
Now you are writing the classes.
So, he's doing something with that stick.
So, multiple ants are travelling on all possible paths laying their pheromone along the path and in fact in in case of a program it doesn't start laying pheromone immediately.
A second, more general, approach is Bayesian inference: If the current patient has a fever, adjust the probability they have influenza in such-and-such way.
It is about using domain knowledge, Okay .
Yes, it was part of the start state that is deleted.
I start with the first element and put it there.
Let us begin talking about GA .
So, all three of them are shown on the screen and as all three possible outcomes that we have.
Now you you like to learn about them.
For example, we decide that X, Y and Z needs to be achieved for going from a start state to the end state.
Second ‘Jay went to a friend's house near cricket stadium.
And the beauty is that once it is done, so, it becomes independent The language is also becomes becoming independent of the words used to represent that concept.
So, this simple method of spraying pheromone value and let it evaporate over time actually decides a path which is, I found recent, because the pheromone value, if it is old will evaporate, and second most preferred by others, because more ants travel along the path more pheromone value.
There are some ways of doing it and we will see how GA is applied. okay .Let us see.
In here the simulated annealing, the random moves are allowed in the beginning and almost disallow them in the final one.
Now how come we have this state?
We have looked at something called generate and test.
Obviously, because it's a longer path.
So, here the symbols are explained the next slide.
F is also copied, Okay .
They're called intuitors, the first type of learners are called sensors.
It is not searching through the search spaces,
But then here are exam…you already have the paths ready.
Evaluation of a system is also done here.
So, here, again it’s called direction.
Okay , for example missionary cannibal we've already I've already talked about that and this slide actually is talking about that again.
May be slight rotation would help.
So the beauty of having a hidden layer is that it can figure out the features from the input and based on those features, the output unit can learn to become active or inactive.
This marked the completion of a significant milestone in the development of Artificial Intelligence as Go is a relatively complex game, more so than Chess.
You'll have to find out the previous state from this.
How do you do?
But here the difference is much larger and much bigger.
It will actually for example, it'll generate hundred possible moves and out of that it explores only first twenty.
So you first, you begin with A now you D.
We are into ninth module of AI .
You placing A on the table.
For example, when your king is under attack, or when there is a fork, possibility of fork.
Clark also presents factual data indicating the improvements of AI since 2012 supported by lower error rates in image processing tasks.
You can see that everywhere there is a white cell, we have zero, everywhere there is a black cell, we have one.
Information is most useful when it is shared within the whole organization.
The functioning of MiniMax again is like what I have talked about.
Now this is not love, you can understand that you're not representing love but that's not the problem of CD ,
The issue is, that if you run the program again it’ll pick up some other random point and start travelling towards goal state again.
As I said, researchers tried to mimic brain.
So, what we have to do is, the previous state equal to what current state minus all additions, additions are to be removed, whatever additions are provided they are to be removed.
There is no standard as such.
So here also we are doing it.
It is the opponent king is the king is under attack.
There are two children, neither of them has better value and they're stuck.
it is quite possible that we may not write one rule without which we cannot solve the problem.
So, it’s basically sigma xi wi where i ranges from one to n.
simulated annealing, we allow bad move, okay .
A plausible move generator is a programme what what does it do?
One of the disadvantages here a single statement representing basically a a a sequence of things.
Many, many search problems which otherwise are not possible to be solved and that's why it's become a very, very popular algorithm, as I said.
What you get are are six-seven children and you apply that that fitness function, the the value, the distance value.
So, you ask them and you learn.
So that's the first requirement.
And my pawn, if I place the pawn in the position that is shown that pawn’s position at that point of time is more than a queen's position because that will help me check the king and the game will be over.
In fact sparse and dense neighbourhood can also be applied in in conventional constructive search.
When this particular process is to be terminated?
So in the case, the leftmost case, we have two outputs - L one is N the other is N.
The third one is minus three and fourth one is minus two.
And so that you must conclude that Jay has done something to reach from stadium to the bus station, Okay .
Out of all possible cases you get converged to the best path and once you start getting such paths obviously, you will be able to get the right tour okay .
Okay , so all these push and pull and and throw and kick, all of them can be represented using this propel, okay .
There is a single knowledge which is to be converted into all this.
So anyway we are not going to discuss much about what it has done, we'll we'll see the introduction of GA .
They they take the lower part of the obstacle, the upper part of the obstacle.
Prototype is first thing.
You can see now H appears in child one. Now corresponding element, Okay you can see.
First of all, it generates and then test .
So, that's the point here.
For example a case of D, okay .
You can, but then when you write rules, how you define a state space ?
For example, five children of the same parent, same pair of parent are very different from each other.
So you can have eight or less .
Because an an action remember we use that word action now, we don't use word rules we call action, that action for action you have to have a prerequisite.
And if you try running this program, looking for all possible alternatives, calculating the the the the length of the path probably the program will not end in your lifetime. okay .
I have already told you in the beginning that GA is quite complex so everything that we are talking right now is basically the simplest thing that we can talk about but in true sense it is it may be pretty complex. Okay .
Everybody is on the right hand side.
The search tree is explored with every move that we take.
Many most of the vision and audio related information is stored that way.
For pedagogy purpose, we can do that and that has been used even by Schank in in his papers.
My table drawer is the third.
It is pretty simple.
Depending on the condition that I use for choosing them, I can have less number of nodes or more number of nodes, depending on the function that I choose.
So total sixteen actually.
There was a game and there was a system called Bstar which was designed by a chess player as well as a computer scientist and he decided that I'll explore till I get some kind of questions, some kind of stability in in in the system.
When the program acts like this, it's basically working on the instruction of the designer which is impossible for complex cases like chess .
And now what I do?
So in case of exploring only first five is a sparse neighbourhood case, exploring twenty is little more dense , exploring ninety is really dense .
Not only it is complex to write rules, it is also complex sometimes to write the prerequisites of the rule.
It's also possible for you to answer question based on this cause effect relationship because this is precisely what scripts are talking about.
In that case, in most cases you have to re-run the program.
The the default form of square doesn’t actually do it.
Remember x zero is not an input, it is a value one and w zero is minus threshold value.
So, here also we have inputs, the inputs are x1 to xn and there are weights, weights are w1 to wn, okay .
So it has to be that way.
what is happening in remember, remembering basically converts something or or transfers something which is there in CP , into long term memory or short term memory.
In this particular module, we have looked at some of the unguided methods.
Because opponent is not going to play that.
Next important thing is to verbalize this knowledge.
That process also is very simple, very logical.
The corresponding element of B here is A.
Not only that, for every problem which we take, there are some implicit assumptions.
Second one is 5,0,3 Okay .
Lot of people play a lot of different ways.
So, that D appears on that three-prong structure that indicates direction and it is also when there is a direction, there is a source and there is a destination.
We look at their characteristics and somehow relate people with similar characteristics together and then group them together, that grouping or clustering of of inputs also is very important, and that also is type of learning, that’s called unsupervised learning, okay .
Testing is done by something of Constraint Satisfaction.
In case of best first, you can even pick up three.
For example, when I'm dealing with this most trivials of problems, we have some implicit assumptions.
That also is mentioned in this particular rule okay .
That means multiply both of them and take a square root of it.
Every node represents some state some typical word uttered by speaker and you're trying to like translate that statement.
So, we have two jugs.
okay You can see that both examples or both conceptualizations.
You take the summation further and if the value is more, so will continue increasing it you will get a better value.
And in but then inheritance involves lot of randomness.
If you try a Depth-first search you probably will not get.
So, that also is very, very important and technical nuances that you probably can use like taking direct data from IMD into medical system or storing data directly in the cloud.
in the beginning you may prefer that, yes it it it it is five, it is good, so we should.
A machine translation engine dedicated to the company’s use is a safe option in terms of data security.
So for this, you again, insert one more goal called free D and for that probably you require one more action called place place on table X okay so which removes X from on top of D and place it on table.
Now suppose you have five outgoing possible lines.
Because we’re looking at all possible nodes and we’ll pick up the node which which gives us steepest ascent, will give us highest value the heuristic value of the children, Okay .
Here also T well decide T suppose for example, we are solving a problem and then we use one annealing schedule with T value is reducing with one and then we'll use with one typical way of reduction weíll use some other way and so on and we'll find out which works better for that problem and we'll use that okay .
For the translation of user manuals, marketing materials and other public documents, a human translator is still recommended.
okay .
So you can easily understand.
The process is the same.
So, because I I don't have complete information every time opponent plays, I’ll generate a an entire subtree as as much as big subtree as I can, and just pick up the next move every time.
What we're going to do is, we are going to look at a problem called Missionary Cannibal problem.
Remember nearest neighbor also was a very good algorithm.
So when I get stability, the moves are not changing much, the state space is not changing much, I believe that is the is the right time to stop and I'll stop.
Now, the first node that we generate is minus one , which is obviously not as good.
Ten indicates winning, minus ten indicates losing.
It is in fact Google Cloud’s recommendation to use The Transformer as a reference model to use their Cloud TPU offering.
Now, this is called Depth-first search.
Now, if I want to place A on top of Y X on top of Y, A on top of B, there are two things required, the preconditions both of them must be free which is shown in the preconditions tag of the action description.
So, those things are the first two things that usually the KE would like to have.
We’ll see an example.
So, they’ll also test their knowledge and this is a very, very useful, important learning experience.
So, readability is the other issue.
I’ve already told you that it is possible to have multiple final states and here we can.
But if you want to write a computer program probably you will have to represent that thing as as the state space which we talked about and do all this jugglery and also you'll have to in fact, here I have not talked about how to represent, how to write moves.
The object of how Mahesh hurt Jayesh what's the object?
Once, that is done we’ll able to recognize my signature much more correctly, okay so that’s how it is done.
Almost every ant will follow that path.
Deletion is on AB will be deleted and now on AB will no longer be true.
‘I MTRANS match’ and ‘I INGEST ice okay They happen together.
So, when you say Mahesh hurt Jayesh is is one conceptualization which is happening, and its use is okay okay as an object okay .
What does that mean?
Okay , let us take a simpler case of having just one one friend.
We just see if the the sequence is a solution,if not we’ll pick up some other sequence.
The beta release is given to the the customers, the usual customers and their feedback is taken and then you release the final product.
So, place on top of B is better, more relevant then place on top of a CD because you will get a better state okay .
Now there are two things you have for example, there are states one two three four and when you you go to a state you will find the state, remember missionary cannibal there are some states which are not acceptable.
How how important is the the central control and how important it is to have occupy a specific position in chess and so on so forth.
And what we want in the end state is C is resting on D and B is resting on A this is what I want.
You’ll have to search for final state and that’s precisely is the is the important part of this particular module.
For example, we look at essays and decide that this is a good essay and this is a bad essay.
For example, TCPIP knowledge is needed for intrusion detection, but the whole thing is available in form of RFCs , you just get that RFC and get that information.
Second, we'd like to avoid defeat if I I don't get to a state which help me win, I’ll I’ll try to pick up a state where I can avoid defeat okay .
Sometime you stuck up, okay .
In fact, what you can do apply is additionally called branch in bound, Okay .
When they are they are successful in finding it.
First, they guide the developer in learning about what's the system, what exactly is the system, what is going to come in, what’s going to be…So, for example, the forms which which we call in conventional system, they are called forms.
At L Gr grain is also on the left hand side.
In fact, you can easily see that the other requirement is available, which will be moving actually.It is a cycle.
What we are going to do in this particular module, one more thing that we are planning to do is is called goal stack planning.
We also have lot of other states where the problem can be in , Okay .
And we expect artificial neural networks to exhibit that characteristic.
It is not, fine, go go further.
And you can see that at the end we what we have is four four zero that means four gallons of milk in in the eight gallon jug. okay .
And exactly you can see on the slide, one solution which begins from eight zero zero.
There are many other notations used there is no standard about this.
So, you can see that the representation in the handout that Dhoni and PROPEL they they are connected like before - actor and action, but here we are talking about an object which is being acted upon, okay .
Chatbot
If I also include zeros and ones, I’ll have I need thirty six outputs.
Attention is a concept that helped improve the performance of neural machine translation applications.
And you pick up first five and so on.
Actions are the vehicle which enables us to do this.
Quite interesting observation can be seen from what we are doing on the right hand side.
You won’t get further; if there is a mutation probably there is escape route possible.
Entities are keywords and phrases that are similar in meaning and that are crucial for your chatbot conversations.
Hello friends! We will begin with the third module on AI .
So,that final for example,I drank soda or slurped it.
Now if you remember our best first search and all that we we used something similar.
okay .
We looked at conceptual roles, tenses and how a statement can be represented using CD .
So what do they do?
What does that mean?
Because if you see that slope okay .
They failed to recognize the difficulty of some of the remaining tasks.
It's impossible because you don't have measuring device.
Now, once you say that Milkha Singh ran, it is done, but when you say Milkha Singh ran in Pakistan, that additional is location.
We we just do addition or subtraction.
Now can you tell me whether the action is relevant or not?
And what are the operations that you will have?
But important thing is while you come back you also have to think about prerequisites.
If it is satisfied, it is fine but if any component is not satisfied it’s again inserted on the stack.
A written review provides valuable information both to the company and customers visiting the company's website.
We have only two rules and we have only few prerequisites so far.
The first difference is that the neuron is very slow, it operates in the range of milliseconds or processors operate in the range of nanoseconds.
In fact, there are more complex problems than chess.
Who will choose it?
And there are a few prerequisites.
Because is already there in the original one it is copied from that.
And one actually can decide a better representation if we pay a little attention to it, one can write better the rules and the state space in a better way.
okay So, with this almost have completed MiniMax algorithm.
There are in fact it's there in the center diagonal lines, two diagonal lines, two horizontal and vertical line the middle column, the middle row and both diagonal lines are possible for you to cover in this case.
Is a repeat node or dead end we’ll try the right, Okay .
It’s it’s again is something that you cannot explain.
please understand, that's the problem of language.
Now, that is whatever is deleted is it part of the goal state?
In such a situation, the recipient can quickly and easily translate the original message into their own language, or the sender can take care of that.
Now, here this is actually a subset of depth bound.
When the best translation quality is called for, or the text type is difficult for a machine translation engine, the use of a human translator should be selected.
It just it uses a simple agent.
So, we are going to discuss about them.
First of all, let us look at the basic brain neuron, okay .
Now, this is a statement that you you probably encounter reading, okay , now here the meaning that CD gets out of this is that Purochan tries to do something which reduces Pandavas health and that actually is is is very, very important representation, because it it it involves something which is a question mark.
Because again, this you probably have seen a lot of beta releases yourself.
they start with a random set, evolve and combine solutions.
Now that is a very hard problem very hard solution but that's the best solution if you can get.
Next one is minus four.
If a progression is relevant, it is actually moving in the right direction.
I've talked about some verbs myself, now you can find a few more.
If they cannot understand, you probably will need to modify.
So not answer those statements like ‘Jay went to the stadium, he bought a ticket’ and so on so forth.
So, it’s reiterates re-strengthens the pheromone volume.
Let us begin talking about this thing .
Okay Multi layer neural network which anyway, I I discussed about that in the previous module and we are going to study that thing really more detail in this particular module.
Now if you, if you look at this, which value out of that will be be passed up?
What does machine translation mean?
The first activation function that we look at is called Square, which we have already seen.
With that will complete this discussion on MiniMax algorithm.
We we have looked at one very simple method of characterizing AI problems called state space representation.
Texts with a short life cycle
And if it is found, the the match we'll store in the usable database.
There is no thumb rule for it.
Now, that is an example of the transfer of ownership; okay , such things are represented using the primitive called ATRANS , okay .
The feed-forward layer does not have those dependencies, however, and thus the various paths can be executed in parallel while flowing through the feed-forward layer.
Now that is also simple but quite effective in some cases.
does crying means tear tears coming out of eyes?
Similarly, if you have one cell occupied and next two are empty is a good state to have compared to a cell where the the the other cells are occupied.
Why?
Now when the ants will continue travelling.
So that data structure, it's pretty complex.
The subscript order is the designer’s choice, there is no fixed rule.
Now that’s little difficult to understand at the first shot but let me explain that in brief.
When the temperature value is less, less probability of moving to a bad move.
Tesseract 4 added deep-learning based capability with LSTM network(a kind of Recurrent Neural Network) based OCR engine which is focused on the line recognition but also supports the legacy Tesseract OCR engine of Tesseract 3 which works by recognizing character patterns.
How users can communicate problems to the company, who will be responsible for handling those customers problem, what type of support staff is needed, how system configuration and implementations are handled, how domain experts are used to handle these problems and so on so forth.
The algorithm is simple.
So, Unguided Search Methods are not all that useless kind of , they are quite useful, so we are going to discuss that.
But technical functionality, testing, quality assurance is also a very, very important critical part of every system.
You probably have heard about Google car, that is self-driving car.
And that was very time consuming.
In this module, we have seen that how this thing is divided into layers, how the activations flow, how the values are calculated, how the weights are named.
We’d begin with a state with heuristic value minus three.
That addition is to be removed then it gets this one.
It is very good rule six, it’s not solution but then there are no possible rules to be applied.
So, many a times you need to again sync between expert, knowledge engineer and the user but then I’ll give you at least that feedback.
So how it is done and you can probably will understand by this figure.
Tears.
Okay , now let us try to understand what the problem is.
In in on the screen you can see there is a simple case where I have seven different cities.
So, all users can have it and so on so forth, can be quite quite handy, quite useful.
When we say ‘flew to LA’, we are providing additional information.
Here also we use small agents which are used collectively to solve complex problems.
KE , however good KE is, he is not that knowledgeable.
It says that on the left hand side, M one minus some M value, number of missionaries are there and C three minus C cannibals are there and R M two plus M.
So, there are more than one things involved.
One, the ability to hear and smell and the other ability is to run fast.
Suppose I am going to sit with somebody who is going to who is an expert of intrusion, he'll start talking about everything that's happening intrusion and I'll have to learn and one of the very, very important outcome is to note down the jargon used in.
So the bike is an object for this PROPEL action, okay .
So that's usually the constraint.
Current state zero current player means, current state is the state, on on which the MiniMax is applied.
Whatever decisions that I make, I'll have to have that KE and expert sit together and they decide that. This is the structure that they need.
Remember, when we’re at the solution?
Have we solved everything?
There is nothing in between.
You can see that first scene is going to a stadium the second scene is buying a ticket, the third one is going inside stadium and sitting on a seat, taking your seat then watching a match and then exiting.
So, point is such things depends on context.
I have already told you the mutation is a process of adding serious randomness, it is very different when compared to this thing .
Okay , scripts were great but then they were quite isolated.
And it had around eight thousand components in the static evaluation function of that Deep Thought computer which could beat Gary Kasparov, had eight thousand components.
What my requirement is to reach to ten.
Sounds simple, it is.
And that was an expert system which is being used in commercial domain.
That again you might probably think. You already have intrusion detection system.
Remember, we discussed about forward and backward planning, when we are using forward planning, we we use progression to move towards goal state and in backward planning we use this thing the regression okay .
The capability of the Tesseract was mostly limited to structured text data.
So that is represented in the handout, you can see that there is a double arrow between I and MTRANS which indicates double dependency.
For example, if you're playing chess, you wont look at all possible moves, you only look at some which are good, which are which are better compared to others.
Now lot of I do not want to again describe the difference between soft computing and AI
Because game tree you cannot explore completely, based on the time available or whatever you you just stop somewhere in the middle.
So, we have applied rule number two.
You can see that there is no mention of dining, there's no mention of eating and so on.
Now you pick up on A table and you realize that it is already achieved.
And maximum is it is three and two are lesser value.
For example, in case number two, you might have four one three is the final state and the the earlier one also you can have two and zero or two and sorry zero and two, three and two is also possible.
The response which is generated from there because because he was threatened by Rajan.
Now you are surprised the earlier example we had twelve moves.
We are not going to discuss about them.
So, you decides about knowledge representation system.
Three plies, only three levels in game the level of tree is called ply. It is eighteen into twenty into twenty for twenty being a branch factor, look at the value I can't read that.
We start with 8,0,0, 3,5,0, 5,0,3 Okay .
Okay .
Simplicity is one, readability is the other.
Second, we’ll only be taking one move.
So, unlike hill climbing it does not get stuck.
You can see that there are now, this is only an extension to what we have seen in the earlier module.
We just assume that is the solution and test if it is a solution if it’s not, we quit.
So, it you can write this thing as w one one, w one two, w one three and w one and so on.
You can use that thing as an algorithm or heuristic.
Now when you provide this cutoff and minimizing level, it is called alpha cutoff.
Zero is the depth, we begin with zero and the current player who am malam player or the other one.
They could concentrate more on more better resumes and it could result into fast far better short-listing process.
You can see that it is it is not difficult to understand how it operates.
So, it is quite possible.
There was only one unit which is input, there’s one unit which is output.
This is the other example.
If you're an expert, you're going to provide your rules, the heuristic rules.
So that is called perturbation search, Okay , unlike the constructive search that we have seen so far.
So that is possible.
Well anyway, there is one excellent expert system which was known as Dendral, designed to use generate and test.
It’s very hard okay to write rules, debug them, and once you do that, your computing system has to choose one rule from them, pretty hard.
So, this is not a relevant move.
All these things are there and then you also have exit conditions or results, Okay .
So, there are many things.
okay , so but the point is heuristics usually help and we need heuristics.
So if you want, if you are interested in studying more about GA probably those are the references, in fact there are pretty more, in fact there are many, many more resources on GA .
What does that mean?
So this one ply search is not very good.
And then we want all missionaries on the other side and then moving cannibals on the other side.
There are parallel scenes, there are alternate scenes.
How can you represent anything of that sort?
So when they are coming back from E, again they find the obstacle.
We stop when there is a six ply explored.okay .
This is just one way of doing it.
We would like to add components which are not there in the start state they're in the end state.
So, the idea is that we are the brain is capable to manage buzzy and incomplete information.
Both of them cannot be one.
So, W and B are not preferred in by many authors.
CD was devised long back, but still is not used to the extent it should.
I can actually try sparse neighbourhood by just assuming a a case where two adjacent cities are being exchanged.
So, they share this information.
The amount of pheromone obviously is more on this.
So, we have to calculate the difference.
Though we have used words in English, basically, they are they are placeholders, okay .
Such systematic errors can easily be fixed by training the translation engine further.
If I also want lower and upper case it is sixty two total.
Similarly, when you talk about run, you're transferring your your own self, throw, you have move or or catch, okay , you you are the recipient of that PTRANS movement, okay .
Okay , and you can see that there is some similarity with frames.
In which situation I I ask the user or the patient to do that and how many times I'm successful in my assumption?
Pick up the temperature value T from the annealing schedule.
And that's where probably Deep Thought team had somebody who was a grand master, chess grandmaster, was part of it.
So first example is comparatively sparse than the second one, okay . Why sparse neighbourhood to be used?
Now, you can see that these two representations happen in parallel.
Now here and this is something also which we've already looked at in the previous module, the statement that we have encountered in previous module.
What the point here is that you can decide that slope on of an activation function for if you want to learn faster and all that.
Quite interesting.
But when we have no directed this thing it becomes half.
So, the inputs flow in the forward direction and whenever the input flows, the output layer checks whether the output is right or wrong.
Here it is if you write general, it is going to be very hard.
And And like the previous case we have four which has two and three and you you cannot go because it’s it’s worse.
We have seen the basic building structure of conceptual dependency, we looked at different primitives.
This model does not need character segmentation.
How they use a pheromone here?
So, you just apply static evaluation function to B, C and D.
You can see on the next slide, now it is little, the PowerPoint animation is running, so better better try to see how it works.
Do you decide whether this packet requires inspection?
How can we solve this problem?
Level number two you have thirty five into thirty five I mean, thirty six in the earlier node.
Okay and I’ve I’ve already talked about the chess playing programs use serious heuristics and sometimes the chess playing programs use heuristics based on the opponent.
Not BPNN is not used a little modified algorithm is used there.
In fact, it is quite possible that when you take the feedback from users, they just discard it.
Similarly, you can write, you can see the move, which moves from right to left.
There are some charts which can tell you whether an activity is to follow some other activity or an activity can happen in parallel with some activity and so on so forth, depending on their prerequisites, their requirement and all that.
And as I said objective function is the same thing as heuristic.
So, in in this case the first two level, the second level, the third level, first level, the third level and the fifth level and so on I'll be invoking MiniMax algorithm.
In this module we'll we'll only mention that.
It works this way and we get quite accurate measurement.
But you can see that there are two indicators, two headers.
When there are no possibility of applying any rules, we can’t move further.
Faintly superimposing such a pattern on a legitimate image results in an adversarial image that the system misclassifies.
In most cases, heuristic function will not give you exact value.
Look at the slide, three missionaries and three cannibals to cross the river with only one boat.
In fact, a complex script will have alternate scenes if a scene af...after one scene if this happened, or this can happen we’ll soon soon see some examples of that.
A real-world example is that, unlike humans, current image classifiers don't determine the spatial relationship between components of the picture; instead, they learn abstract patterns of pixels that humans are oblivious to, but that linearly correlate with images of certain types of real objects.
Now we again run that thing, find out the complete search tree, and then decide the next move.
Product release is also planned.
Now, we have already seen Sachin went to LA.
So, once that part is done, why we are doing that thing?
And you you do that further probing how experts decide and what are the past record indicates.
What about the second one?
So, that's why we are learning about this, Okay .
So, 5,0,3 will take our left child which is 8,0,0, next child 0,5,3, next child is 5,3,0. Okay .
Now it's not always a great thing to do but then most cases you don't have other option Okay .
Then there are texts for which quick delivery is the most important thing.
Difference between this winding and unwinding phase is, winding phase if you call f-one and then again the next call and a third call, so winding part happens first here, then here, then here, then here normal conventional case.
So, there is another point.
The third major approach, extremely popular in routine business AI applications, are analogizers such as SVM and nearest-neighbor: After examining the records of known past patients whose temperature, symptoms, age, and other factors mostly match the current patient, X% of those patients turned out to have influenza.
To create a Story, you need to use conversational elements like bot responses, user input, attributes, entities, etc.
So,sometimes a normal rule of thumb Schank used in his paper he referred somewhere in his paper that whenever he encountered at least two heads, Okay in headers he’ll invoke that script.
The algorithm chooses one out of those cases.
So, these things can be inferred though it is not directly mentioned in the script it those things can be inferred and that's the power of script.
How do you decide that this packet requires deep inspection?
Does something else.
So, in branch and bound however good it is, it does not have any sense of direction in true sense.
So, what I do is I provide images of five different friends of mine and I want the neural this neuron to learn to classify them.
See what we have done.
Thanks.
So, this is a very, very critical part of the system design, the expert system design.
It tests whether you are fit.
Will be discussing about this in more depth in the next module.
So, we are just planning.
Similarly, the carnivorous animals also, okay they can only survive if they run fast and they are better okay.
So, when I'm reading basically, it MTRANSING information from that newspaper to CP and once CP reads it, it might use short term memory for processing it and then transfer that thing into long term memory.
So it begins with NULL but when it goes up, it adds to, it add that thing .
So, that’s precisely what we've done in this chapter in this module.
So you can conclude that his favorite team has won.
So, Sachin has actually moved from somewhere to LA.You can see that.
The statement is basically talking about few events.
A question asked why Manoj gave Rajan a chocolate.
And the deletion you know what is the deletion?
How have you come to know that this move , the set of moves is complete which is going every move that we need is is possible to be be fetched from this thing ?
Chess, is very structured compared to others and seemingly complicated problem but comparatively more structured so people have solved that problem and there are many other problems which are not possible to be solved for example, rating an essay.
In a nutshell, it it is defined like this.
Brian solves many problems without algorithm.
So simple?
Nothing is flawless in this world and CD is not no exception.
There are some other representations possible as well.
You may invite and you may run both things together because the customer wants it.
Now if the question is asked why Jay asked who won the toss?
You know that in a given chemical structure, something which is impossible , is impossible.
But that is not happening here.
Some of the components of the initial state space does not exist in the final one and some of the one which exists in final one does not exist in the start one.
These two things are laugh coming inside as as as an input to Dendral and what Dendral does?
Yes.
Two.
Feed forward means, the inputs are flowing in the forward direction.
But anyway chess is better program to be managed compared to many other programs.
So, what he did, he wrote a neural network based program.
So, that's why that is very needed.
The speed and again the decision is to be taken, the processing is has to be pretty fast.
And the you can see the row the next one the row value.
And when you consider the threshold, you also have X zero W zero, where X zero is basically one.
I'm exploring one more child of I, after I explored P.
The prerequisites of the rule describes the conditions when the rule is applicable.
So, in this particular module we will be discussing about what neural networks are in subsequent to more modules.
cough The rule number sixteen talks about an attribute of an actor and the actor himself, that relation.
Again opponent.
So, it's basically the first step in the development process.
Look at the second figure and look at the data which is generated from that figure.
Okay For a complete binary tree I’ve already talked about number of node is almost double themselves at every level.
You will design the database first or knowledge base or you're going to write the rules or you’re going to collect those rules and if there are more than one experts, how you're going to sync those rules and so on so forth.
So, it it it calculates it that way.
Not only that, the fox will have nothing to do with grain.
What that would like to end this particular module, what we have seen in this particular module?
For example, there is an obstacle which is placed.
When it reaches to the calling node, we'll have the complete path.
We have seen to it's hard to write preconditions.
Some people also consider AI to be a danger to humanity if it progresses unabated.
Okay , the first rule says X Y Z.
Okay , so it it it looks simple on the face of it, but it is hard.
How GA works?
So, that is called Variable neighbourhood.
If we’re exploring like hill climbing we’ve we’ve come to a dead end actually because three only two children minus one and minus two both of them are having less value so we’ll not be going forward.
So, that is also mentioned.
And you can see that the ‘reason’.
A heuristic for this particular problem can be something like this.
Earlier we used to write the value of the variable the variable itself.
One, you pick up the first state, second state, third state start applying rules and go ahead.
What we do is out of twenty we just apply fitness function like heuristic function, it is like top five or top six or whatever. okay .
We can not expect the OCR model to be 100 % accurate.
Humans also have a powerful mechanism of folk psychology that helps them to interpret natural-language sentences such as The city councilmen refused the demonstrators a permit because they advocated violence .
So, the next slide actually talks about talks about how you can write the rule in little more flexible, little more general way.
This is called hill climbing.
So that is what we are going to look at.
But then I would say, give me all positions of that. How many such matrices you will provide? Think of it.
And I want to get the shortest tour.
We start with that.
So that's not easy.
And it is quite possible that one expert gives a different list, the other expert gives a different list.
And again, if the script writer is good enough, it it could get this information that why one can get bored?
Okay .
Each one of them and then find out the best out of it.
Okay , so, that slope can be adjusted.
We'll look at one more problem called eight five three gallon milk jug problem.
So this is how Depth Bound Depth-first search is is executed.
So, that is the first thing, the no no algorithm issue.
Now the exit condition of one particular script and the entry condition of the other script, you will have to join them.
How do How do I get one?
If it is better go ahead.
That means that I'm sending two cannibals on the other side.
And…And many times CD attempts to get more information out of that statement.
It's kind of a draw.
Now how can I remove all that?
And sixty-two if it is upper lower case as well as digits.
Now the first thing we have to do, is to write the state space of it.
And we'll find out we’ll for all possible paths, we just add two components, we’ll find minimum and then start travelling.
So we start from one, the initial state we move across the the state space and we’ll reach to the final state. deep breath .
And then from five I get seven, I move, a seven, eight I can move up and so on.
Similarly, E F G H not equal to six, twelve and four.
So that is the next one, but if the total is less than three, you can pour everything here and this becomes completely empty .
So, this is what it it should do.
If we call A as an action and addition a and deletion are functions, toh what we can do it with our methods or so we say that A A dot addition, the action A adds whatever it adds okay it’s called A dot addition and we take an intersection with goals state, we call it GS .
So, you have those values differentiated that way.
If there is a model behind this decision process, that model is to be explicitly specified, that this is the decision-making process if else and all that if so.
Okay One very simple way of doing it.
It just sums up things.
We have introduced Neural Networks in this module, we have seen how brains work, the artificial neuron and then we have looked at how this artificial neuron actually can process data, we have seen how threshold value can also be used together with the other inputs and we have seen two activation functions, square and sigmoid.
So, it is possible that the different hidden units learn to remain active when there is a typical feature present in the file the present in the image.
Sentiment analysis can help a chatbot analyze user messages and identify whether the person’s attitude towards certain products or services is negative, positive, or neutral.
So, I’m I'm not going to talk in detail about But the idea is to have user’s input and other expert’s input and get the system better over the period of time, provide corrections to the knowledge base and sometimes the primary expert himself.
For example, somebody speaking in Hindi and the the listener is French .
We can say that this row , we call it w zero , so it is basically and we can take it on the left side of the equation, what we have is x one, w one, x two w two at the end minus w zero greater than zero , then it is firing, less than zero, it is not firing, or output one or zero.
I I may say that height equal to or or I say height in the bracket six point two.
That's used as a placeholder.
Some AI systems, such as nearest-neighbor, instead of reason by analogy, these systems are not generally given goals, except to the degree that goals are implicit in their training data.
B represent fox and fox value is two.
We have also seen threat of fork and degree of freedom as additional two components of for SEF .
Now, this is simplified version of the very function.
But then there are two issues.
There are sometimes other functions used, we’ll be looking at few other functions in due course.
It has only two options left - left and right.
But that is precisely what we’re supposed to do and that’s the theme of this chapter.
It stores that information in some convenient form, which is not known to anyone of us, okay .
For example, you decide the limit of your search say is three.
It is not about a searching through state space, no.
So, that is a difference, okay .
So, there are three different conceptualizations acting together to represent a given statement, Okay .
So, that is important here and remember what I have told you the the leaf nodes you apply that static evaluation function okay and then it passed up, that happens in the unwinding part of the function.
One is 4,4,0 and the other one is 4,1,3.
Now we are talking about pouring milk in 5 gallon jug.
I have already discussed that thing.
B is fox or not fox.
There is some similarity with simulated annealing as well.
Now again, a critical difference is that unlike the earlier case, it is not yes- no thing.
So, and what if some other ant has travelled some other path?
There is no ISA relationship okay .
So what we do is we begin with random set of weights and somehow make sure that these weights are changed over a period of time and converged into the set which gives us the right combination, right answer for every input that we provide.
So, that is called positive misclassification, okay .
I'm not going to play C.
How it is done?
He thought of these primitives.
Many systems attempt to reduce overfitting by rewarding a theory in accordance with how well it fits the data, but penalizing the theory in accordance with how complex the theory is.
It’s a feature that allows you to make a copy of an existing chatbot scenario.
Why?
These inferences can be obvious, such as since the sun rose every morning for the last 10,000 days, it will probably rise tomorrow morning as well.
Ant colony optimization is a very popular algorithm some time back, is still being used, but not to the extent used to be.
Okay .
So, if if you want to have an X-ray, what are the ingredients?
Okay , let us look at one important factor that was best first search.
So, because we allow the bad state you need to have this best so far.
For every children, the second step though is non leaf, will consider it to be leaf and proceed further.
More components means more time and Deep Blue in conventional cases could explore six seven plies and sometimes fifteen to twenty plies and in that case think of a number of nodes that you will have to apply the static evaluation function to.
If you have lost your path, you will prefer to walk on a trail, Okay .
So, if you feel that it is not very good about CD , it is actually the problem with the language and not CD .
But how do you search using branch and bound?
So you'll have to figure out which position is better over the other and give marks accordingly so the the value accordingly.
So, basically T is related to that.
Machine translation is not fully replacing human translators, but it can help humans with texts that would otherwise probably not be translated at all.
It is a cycle, Okay .
So, the network becomes little big, pretty complex but the process is going to be the same.
Physically, the square function look the same ,as shown on the slide.
Suppose if you have four possible moves okay B,C,D any you can get either of them.
It is quite possible that you apply the same MoveGen function and what will it do?
Our our movement actually places A on the table.
If we would like to reach to our goal state, the most important thing is that we are moving and if we’re not moving we'll not be reaching there.
Incrementing that by one and converting Player into the other player and also negating the values.
We represent the concept and not the words and that's the power of CD .
Suppose if I I just pick up all cities, finding out distances between them.
Now, what did Ram do?
You can see that.
How do we know that these rules are going to be useful for solving a problem?
Machine translation helps with information sharing and communication
The because he's an opponent and you can see that there are some winning already okay .
Anyway so humans can do it but when computers are to do it, they have to convert the problem is to be converted into state space like we've done and and and we'll have to find out the rule and apply that rule and again if there are multiple rules, you’ll have to arbitrate somehow and get the right rule to apply.
What’s whenever when the outcome or the result is getting bored, it can write those things correctly, then it is also possible for somebody to predict why he got bored.
Now, the first one is A.
How this starts?
How converting one state into another requires complex processing.
People have done it, but it's not going to be easy .Okay .
In case of positively misclassified case, what has happened?
As I said, eight thousand components were there in that thing , and it was very, very powerful.
Because, we are moving it.
It defines learners of two different types, one type of learners are sensors, who learn from outside and the other type of learners are intuitors, they they they they learn from within, they they conceive things, they they process things, they think over whatever is presented and learn from them.
So what you can do is you can apply variable , the neighbourhood descent function.
So if it is not working that fast it’s not going to be that useful, that that powerful.
Now that precondition, the the actions precondition, the state's precondition should also be there.
So we stop.
Okay . In next case well explore all hundred and explore only first five, okay .
In fact,I I was.
B is one fifty and C is one fifty.
So, that's why the conventional search algorithms won't work here because conventional search algorithm will always pick up the best heuristic value which is not going to work here.
You can see 8-0-0, 5-0-3, 0-5-3, 3-5-0, 8-0-0.
5,0,3 is already explored.
If I cut and paste them what will happen, I will have two cities, the same city is appearing twice in the route which is not correct and some cities do not even appear, so that is not acceptable.
The first layer, connects to every unit of the second layer, the unit or neuron or number of neurons.
You can’t represent that in the state space.
And that’s the reason why we’re not going to discuss much about this.
So, it is again varying .
And the third option is simple - Ask the user, what is Epicurean?
Not only that, this is also useful for exploring in real time.
Look at that, X Y where X belongs to four zero, sorry zero four and Y belongs to zero three . So any value between zero to three, any value between zero to four, is something that you can write.
When this particular user is to be blocked?
Again you can see that is quite similar to the state that we have seen before.
Now, that probably requires some more explanation.
So, that is acceptable.
In this case, a chromosome is a string, simple.okay .
There are people involved like waiters and cashiers and and others who serve, hotel manager is the person who take orders and so on so forth.
Now it's very interesting how the values is is passed in this case because this is a minimizing level the last level the sixth level is minimizing level.
There are three examples shown on the screen.
but in a way we are not going to discuss that further in this particular module.
The output units will be five or six.
Okay So and we have take taken a character recognition example.
Now I'm I’m using hurt as hurt only.
So we are going to discuss about how we can browse through the graph, the search tree that is generated for any game, how we proceed and how we find a move which is the best move for us.
So, when you want to represent act inflicting the state change, you will have to use this.
In the case number two, when you try to achieve one the it takes more time because it is not that straightforward.
Population is a word which is known used what we have.
Regression is relevant - again it is moving in the right direction.
We have three units.
So, I have that option.
So, in in that case you can see that this place on table A is relevant.
Similarly, at Ith hidden unit, it shows on the screen, the only difference is that it was one, the the second suffix was one which becomes I now.
We don't have something which can really represent love.
Ravan is dead means his health is reduced to minus ten, what was it earlier, maybe greater than minus ten.
What are the additions?
For example, if you say that I'll I’ll bond the DFS for four levels and if you get answer, the difference between the optimal solution and the solution that you get is not more than 3.
Okay , so that is again, very, very important.
What about this?
It shows that J equal to zero to N.
So that is that can predict, Okay .
Fine.
Okay , many a times we look at things and classify them.
Based on this we can draw a search graph or tree like shown in the next slide.
The method is is applied in a way that the the all all alternate alternative state is possible, all all all children of a node they are tested and and checked if one is better than the other.
When I say I run or Milkha Singh ran, what does that mean?
This is precisely what we want and the boat moves on the right side.
If you use heuristic you become guided.
Remember it it applies back propagation algorithm for learning where the errors are propagated back.
This is one way of representing.
So these are all unguided methods.
And there is something called virtual infinity.
So what should I choose?
if your heuristic function is good enough and you're choosing the best moves, then you're going to save a lot of memory as well as computing power and you will be able to complete the this thing in time.
The basic approach is also decided whether you will use goal-directed reasoning or forward reasoning or whether you will use inference at this place or not, and so on so forth.
Neuron’s memory is pretty less, it store very few things.
And remember a true sense of direction can only come if you have a good heuristic okay , otherwise you won't have so that's the point here that I will like to make.
There's something called plausible move generator.
In this case we’ll have only eighty one, nine nine into nine is eighty one inputs.
What should it be?
But you may do this and you will be able to get the right answer.
And when cycle appears the rest of the elements are picked up from the other parent and copied.
if SS is the final solution set that satisfies the the criteria that you like to achieve, is great.
If you play chess, you know what I'm talking about.
We will be discussing some of the best techniques in the following section.
That is what is is going to remain the same everywhere.
sorry I cannot talk about right now, if you if you look at the mathematical background of some algorithms like Back propagation, you probably will be able to understand why differentiation is a must.
This is the best method because you were exploring everything in parallels.
Z is amount of milk in the three gallon jug.
okay So, that is how this thing processes, because this recursive function there are three different components, winding, call and unwinding.
Similarly, the middle part of parent one is copied into child two.
and if if you do it that way, out of five you can generate twenty more.
We'll see the examples of all of them soon.
This is a very robust deep learning method for text detection based on this paper.
What is addition?
It is worth mentioning as it is only a text detection method.
It's Sachin is going from somewhere, we don't know where, we have just the statement, does not have the information that from where Sachin has started but we know that where Sachin has landed, Los Angeles.
And once a good designer has designed that script and that is used in representing a statement you can get immense value out of it.
Let’s first look at how to calculate self-attention using vectors, then proceed to look at how it’s actually implemented – using matrices.
Okay , B plus F is two.
cough And interestingly most of the cases entry conditions are not satisfied specified in the statement but when they are not specified in the statement, they are assumed like in the case of the earlier statements that we have encountered.
So, testing is to be done from that angle and that's why it is different than conventional system and you should also make sure that what will happen if the decision is wrong okay .
An expert actually verbalizing in this verbalizing his knowledge in this process.
Same boat is available which can carry only two items.
Second thing, if I say, show me a move .
We don't have any other measuring device and would like to have exactly two gallons of water in a four gallon water jug.
How will you code them?
What's the advantage?
And if you want to get one you will have to get the summation should be positive infinity, which is very hard, almost impossible to get.
And this is the example of the integer values that I was talking about.
And how you do that?
So, I’ve I’ve numbered them that way.
Why it is so?
Every time you do it okay , so that is what MiniMax algorithm is.
Okay. If I say three , I have many more.
The beauty of representing things into using script is that it can help you learning about sequential and causal relationship because the agents act in sequential fashion, Okay , like buying tickets and then going inside the stadium and so on so forth.
On CD is a precondition for the action okay place on top CD.
So this is a Sparse neighbourhood. Okay , Anyway .
Unguided search methods does not use heuristic.
As a newbie to chatbots, I had to Google every fifth word to translate the developer talk into something more normal in order to get the gist of it.
So longer the path less the pheromone value.
Okay and we have few examples, I watched a match, what does that mean?
For example, you begin with a sparse neighbourhood when you stuck up, when you have a problem, when you have local maxima try dense neighbourhood and try an alternate route, okay ?
This neural network architecture integrates feature extraction, sequence modeling, and transcription into a unified framework.
You can see the right hand side we have the mapping.
Or or ‘Ram is in love’ does not indicate what's the object of love, whom he loves.
There is the other algorithm which also is quite useful.
The simple programs are are are pretty hard on the face of it.
let them win or survive themselves and those who survive after some time, collect them and made them.
So whenever there is no node to explore you cannot go further and there is no end, there is no this thing road ahead.
Depth Bound Depth-first search is, there is some limit you decide.
For example, in this case, Jay got bored not because security person has shown him or or tell him to stand in a queue but he got bored because he has to wait for a long period and the queues were pretty long.
Now, if you look at that figure, it is the initial position when j is seven, indicates that it is the initial position of that black piece.
It is done using some practical implementation and comparing with the results and you use the best one which suits you, suits that problem actually.
I was reading about an expert system which had twelve million rules .
When I tell you that I went to watch a match, you you assume a lot of things.
And here one more interesting thing about travelling salesman problem is we can we can actually choose a Sparse neighbourhood or dense neighbourhood function.
Some presentation again, there are two things which I'm trying to talk about.
But the the second one we’ll have a chance to win, okay if the opponent makes mistake.
If you want the the answer, the solution, in minimum number of steps from the the root node or the initial state, BFS is the best solution.
So, you can see that verb called ‘shot’ is represented like this.
Okay one after Jay being late, he asking a question and he's getting the response.
And you can see that the Epicurean problem that I talked about, now if you have a right ontology which clearly indicates that Epicurean is is type of a restaurant, reasoning can be pretty easy. Okay .
So, if a an ant has found a food source, if other ant is looking for a path there is high probability that the other ant chooses the same path.
We have already seen number of missionaries must be greater than or equal to number of cannibals.
Now see corresponding element is B, so B is copied, you can see that B is copied again, so in child one at this point of time is A, B, C, D, next three are unknown, H and unknown.
Now that yesterday is is indicated. Now you can see that it’s not a double arrow it’s a single arrow.
In the other one, order crossover method we we copy some part of the parent into a child and the rest is filled up from the other parent based on the order in which this thing appear in the in the parent itself.
And it can actually help cause effect determining cause effect relationship as well.
For example, I I if I found a statement that I went to Jungle Book yesterday and we enjoyed our dinner.
In this case, you can see that on on the slide, that we assumed output units to be six, the input units eighty-one.
And you again can see that there is a placeholder called ‘Do’.
It says everybody is on the left hand side, nothing nobody is on the left hand side, everybody is on the right hand side.
So let’s try to break the model apart and look at how it functions.
And you can see that the source is Sachin, the destination is Sarfaraz.
So, there is a P on on top of the double arrow.
So that is related, that the relation is indicated by an arrow and an O object, okay .
CD is kind of a structure where you have all verbs listed and there is a form available.
When we are talking about recombination, we are talking about combining parents in a way that they inherit almost everything from parent.
There are few strategies which are quite simple as I said, but quite useful as well.
Every input unit or neuron is connected to every middle unit, okay .
So, we don't need to bother much about the theory issue.
Now you can see that if I only label like winning losing this draw.
Let us see.
So, there are two components involved.
But then you can’t move further.
But then we don't need to.
So, that kind of meaning can be derived out of a statement, which was not possible using any other method before and this may in fact, if the proper statements are there before this particular statement is invoked, probably the CD representation will be will be such that the the Purochan tried to burn Laksha Gruha to make sure Pandavas health becomes minus ten.
One is ant colony optimization, the other one is called branch and bound and the third one that we are going to look at is called refinement search.
So, these are very simple goal stack planning
First, how to write this function?
Now we are substracting M.
Total path between any two cities in a given graph is based on the number of cities that you have.
This is a more critical part than it looks at the first shot.
The back-propagation algorithm is one of the most commonly used algorithm and that's why we are going to stress about how that functions and how one can use that algorithm for solving problems which otherwise not possible to be used, not possible to be solved by other means.
So, the question is, should we define rules which cannot use for solving a problem?
So Jungle Book is is a restaurant.
Three integers, simplest of representation of this particular problem.
And that's a very, very important thing.
Now this is good for pedagogy purpose but in true sense this will be a complete CD representation.
Now, when I have explored only first ply, B looked promising.
The people who worked on it call it objective function. Okay .
So, this is basically the process.
Attributes can be described as packages including information (e.g., name, email, phone number) a chatbot collects while chatting with a user.
Not always we learn that way.
Now it is impossible for the speech translation program to go back and try other because it has to be continuously translating everything that the person is speaking.
If it is not, I’ll go to the first step.
We begin with state called eight zero zero, the initial state.
You can also find this code for this project on a Kaggle kernel to try it out on your own.
Welcome back friends.
We have also seen some of the advantages are as well as the shortcomings of CD .
What are the processes involved, what exactly a doctor going to do, what exactly a patient going to do, who is going to do with the expert system, who is going to provide what to expert system, who expects what from expert system and so on so forth is done in the prototype construction phase.
Then we apply the first rule which makes it four, so this state is good so we move to four .
The syntactic rules okay , the second one talks about the the relation between an actor and the attribute of the actor or PP and PA , okay .
So, but you may ask, let us keep it like this, so it will immediately bump up and learn, no.
The the amount of we have already travelled okay so that we have value which is known and that that is not an estimate of anything.
Faster computers, algorithmic improvements, and access to large amounts of data enabled advances in machine learning and perception; data-hungry deep learning methods started to dominate accuracy benchmarks around 2012.
So if you use nearest neighbor algorithm to find one path and then travel other paths and see if it if they are going beyond that nearest neighbors skip them.
In in most cases, you won’t have the luxury of having that much amount of memory to store all those nodes there.
When to reduce?
Typing delay
One is called Path Representation which we already have done.
Now, let us look at the travelling salesman problem.
With that we’ll come to an end of this particular module.
So when you find statement talking about something abnormal which is not mentioned in the script, probably the results are not there.
How you decide a state?
And that's why we have to provide number of images, okay .
So, for example, ‘Sachin took a taxi to reach Boriwali’ or ‘Sachin reached Boriwali by taxi’ or ‘Sachin picked up a cab to Boriwali’.
So this is how you represent the state space .
It is completely distributed and all all neurons work in parallel.
So, point is I should not be diverted in in wrong direction.
It works like a geologist who looks at the sample of earth and do something with it, they tries to figure out what it contains, Okay , the kind of material and all that .
This is not better than the current one so we’ll not move.
But number of missionaries calculate two plus zero is two.
For example, we have assumed that eight,zero,zero is the beginning this thing a move, Okay .
So, this again is an invalid state, okay .
I can move to three,five,zero and I move I can move to three,two,three, Okay .
If it's not a leaf node what should it be doing?
So okay , so that's how it it learns?
The farmer is represented by one, the fox is represented by two, the chicken is represented by four and grain is represented by eight.
A toy example is that an image classifier trained only on pictures of brown horses and black cats might conclude that all brown patches are likely to be horses.
And there are cases which which requires more for example, more elaborate representation.
Because it works with the search tree where you have alternate layers of min and max layers.
it should be null, it should be phi.
Apart from chatbots, NLP powers plenty of apps and services including Google Translate or Grammarly.
This function is known as as activation function.
W two zero one means the weight between the zeroth or the first hidden unit to the output unit one, remember.
Remember we have discussed about solution space in the earlier modules.
But then there are some issues with using this as SEF .
There is no ontology.
We also have a final state.
There are so many other problems which we can talk about
Look at what it returns.
Now, there are two things happening.
Sometimes, somebody do have but usually our brains are capable of making sure, even if the neurons die, they do not lose data.
Which one should I choose?
Instead if you if you do the other way around if you if you place B on the table, again start state does not have B on the table so that is one way it is not adding anything which is good, but the second one.
Dense neighbourhood gives you more number of nodes.
In that case it is five hundred into five hundred inputs and so on so forth.
Obviously, there are no algorithms here.
And in fact this method, though we have not yet specified how it is, so we we’ll look it later.
But that's not that simple, we’ll see how how how to proceed using that.
L three three, R zero zero.
That makes it an important cutoff here and this this happens at maximizing layer.
You are able to work in a in with a partial information.
I've collected all of them, from collect collected them from the papers, so you better you may read those papers yourselves.
So, then that's not the right way.
And mathematically representing this part is also possible.
CD Now, this is an excellent example how CD can aid information. We already have how CD generates this structure.
Flat white
That means that in the initial run avoid all moves which moves missionary on the other side.
When an online store is operating in multiple countries, using machine translation for translating reviews can be an excellent way to serve customers.
Is it a valid state?
In a way that in the initial run you you allow that okay some some move to a bad state from a current state is allowed.
For example, one typical example I could quote from Mahabharat is Purochan endangered Pandavas.
Obviously, plausible move generator and static evaluation functions are assumed to exist.
So who will choose it?
okay .
So after few iterations probably the solutions that you have are better than the earlier ones. Okay .
The success was due to increasing computational power (see Moore's law and transistor count), greater emphasis on solving specific problems, new ties between AI and other fields (such as statistics, economics and mathematics), and a commitment by researchers to mathematical methods and scientific standards.
It is due to in the the human and other spaces, it is basically due to external influences like radiation.
We are now into thirtieth module of AI .
And on the right hand side Fr, fx, ch and grain.
We are not going to discuss that further.
Minus one is the best node right now , Okay .
It is not about starting from start state to go to final state, no.
We’ve seen that we we we entangled into local maxima and if we find that our children don’t have the value better than us, what should we do?
If I have three consecutive cells occupied state is one ten.
I’m testing everything for a solution.
And throw and kick as I've talked about also involves involve moving a body part, the other one is called MTRANS , mental transformation, something where the the mind is involved.
So the first string initial path is pasted with the later path of the second string, second strings initial path is pasted with the later path of the first string.
And it is also called tolerance level.
So I'm skipping and I'm I'm pruning all those branches, okay .
Please accept such things, okay , because expert systems are almost always designed this way.
So, this context determines the meaning of a statement which we are not talking about.
Now look closely at this representation of eight five three gallon water jug.
Branching factor is number of nodes that you’ll have as a child on an average.
And static evaluation function is not the one thing. There are there are multiple components involved in it.
So, from that newspaper it is going into my mind and when you talk about Schank, who developed this and his team, the the team members who developed this, use three different parts of brain, one is long term memory which retains everything that is remembered, short term memory and and a conscious processor that something which processes the information.
Here I have shown one example of again I'll pick up our own eight five three gallon water jug problem and I've shown how two paths are explored in parallel.
Similarly, number of cannibals which are C, substracted from the left hand side and added on the right hand side.
I was talking about if you if you use some heuristic to find the shorter paths before.
So, once you do that, what you've done is you’ve identified components and given those values.
A fourth approach is harder to intuitively understand, but is inspired by how the brain's machinery works: the artificial neural network approach uses artificial neurons that can learn by comparing itself to the desired output and altering the strengths of the connections between its internal neurons to reinforce connections that seemed to be useful.
From B every other city than A and B and so on so forth.
For instance, optical character recognition is frequently excluded from things considered to be AI, having become a routine technology.
Obviously, the pheromone value on path one will be higher.
ACO is applied at many places including solving a vehicle routing problem, assignment problem, set problems, image processing where you need to process in highly parallel fashion.
Pick up better from that and continue like that.
Do you want to make the company’s internal, international communication easier? 
So, it learns to to accept G even without that.
We have an initial state, we have a final state, we need to move around around in the state space and that is what we call a search, Okay . A method.
In the previous post, we looked at Attention – a ubiquitous method in modern deep learning models.
The remaining part talks about a very simple improvement that that we can make.
A human professional can introduce deeper meanings and desired nuances into the text.
We’ll end this module.
In the following, we will go through some scenarios where machine translation can help with a company’s daily operations.
The rule number thirteen.
That means this path is more attractive.
So, it can see that you you can see that X results into Y that results into Z and this relationship is going to help us getting the answer.
Then min, then max, then min, then max and so on.
There are two stories provided.
The game is over.
For example, I go to restaurant, obviously, I have two have two entry conditions.
Remember, we have to find out maximum value in case of a maximizing layer, minimizing at at the minimizing layer.
That’s a local surrounding, Okay .
And and in fact, when you represent concept like love, the same thing probably would happen, you may say that that something happened which makes the mental state equal to ten or something.
Same way in other domains, okay so, there are some symptoms, which tells you that there is something wrong.
Anyway, but when you find that the script is appropriate, you have immense advantage of using them.
When when the array becomes empty because there is no node to explore, Okay .
Because you know that this trail the for example, you lost yourself in a jungle, you you you’ll travel on a trail which is which is there, you know that this people have walked on this and that's why there is a trail.
There are few heuristic search methods that we’ve seen in this particular module.
I should be written in two things.
There are some rules that determines how the representation takes place.
So, the output is whether is your is the friend’s image or not.
That’s called local maxima.
We don't have programs which can play many other games , but still we have programs which can play chess.
So let us first of all try or talk about one of the simplest requirements.
And what are the concerns about the impa When when the system fails to detect intrusion or when the system fails to detect a disease, when the system incorrectly classifies a disease which is not and so on so forth.
So why?
When, for instance, a disturbance in production can be announced quickly to a large group of people, the problem can also be responded to quickly and effectively.
Instead of zero, we accept point one, instead of one, we accept point nine, just because of this problem.
Now, there are some challenges in this, Okay , and what are the challenges we’ll be looking at but the point is, when we encounter an indication of such scenario, we’ll not only enter the information contained in that statement but contained or assumption that the complete scenario has taken place, we’ll insert everything else Okay .
It seems due to image clarity, tesseract could not recognize it perfectly.
But we choose rule number one .
You may be surprised.
So, wi xi is is going beyond a point you output one otherwise you output zero.
You can see that it is being repeated yet again but now for two levels. Okay .
So, every A contain eighty one inputs.
When you approach positive infinity, it approaches one.
Here in unlike hill climbing, we allow a bad state.
See, the first, now we what we are doing is, we are we are taking the same example, 8-5-3- gallon water jug.
Okay , the other method which we are going to see is called Beam search.
The problem is most of the AI program problem is that they're very, very hard to characterize.
Rajan told Manoj if he did not give him chocolate, he will not let him pray play with his friends.
So in the beginning we’ll use just this and calculate.
Can we move?
You can say that farmer is on A side, fox is on B side chicken is on C side and grain is on D okay .
I consider it to be part of AI at least the initial part GA was quite associated with AI .
So, Sachin moves himself and object is Sachin himself.
Quick replies are short chatbot messages that suggest users possible options.
Now state space is a little clumsy in the sense that we we write a lot of like L A B C D.
where we had only few nodes to explore and we could get the answer.
So, what we need is an static evaluation function.
Let me tell you that this neural networks began when there was no hidden unit.
Whenever a statement is presented CD representation, the first job to convert that into CD representation is to derive meaning out of that statement and once the meaning is derived, that thing, okay , is represented.
Now that part is to be represented.
Now we are writing the value of the variable.
Suppose if there are two ants, one travels here, the other travel through a longer path and both of them have found their the same food source.
First thing is initial value of temperature, when to reduce it and how much to reduce Okay , for example, initial value is twenty.
Sometimes obviously the best of the old generation strings are cloned into the new one, those who have or having better fitness values to make sure that you get a better offspring in the next generation.
There is a formula you just apply if the heuristic function give you exact measure of how far the goal node is, you don’t need to do.
Toh static evaluation function in chess is based on two different components - The rho obviously based on the original value, original capability of that piece to move around and capture other pieces and the positional.
But then the transfer of of ownership is is from Sachin to Sarfaraz and that is important here.
Now, in true sense such things are not acceptable.
For example, W one zero one means a weight between zeroth input unit to first hidden unit.
Machine translation is also useful in the translation of internal documentation.
The other one is keeping this thing as a question mark and look at the the the other statement that comes next and figure out what that placeholder is.
For example, one example that is given in in the handout says, Sachin gave his bat to Sarfaraz.
And then there are others also.
Now, such a move is not very good.
And then you send farmer farmer and chicken on the other side.
Not in all cases those simple addition and subtractions are possible.
There are a few statements like, I I just talked about Ram is in love with Sita, Ram loves Sita, Ram found Sita loving and these all statements will have same representation.
See earlier we had a problem.
Fallback
So you can choose the book that suits your domain, look for heuristic function or try writing for yourself but otherwise it's it’s simple.
It can find horizontal and rotated bounding boxes.
The system wants to learn whether it has to cook for Jay or not and there is no mention.
Looking at the differences, probably we will have some idea what is different in in in computer artificial neuron, in the the brain compared to the the processors and the the we’ll learn about the motivation for having the artificial neuron.
Now, let us try to formalize whatever we have stated.
But that you don't need to check like the earlier case not and all that is just gone, why?
So, that's precisely describing our requirement.
Sometimes people call on..on.. only in addition to any algorithm.
Okay , so kind of Okay , so and I'm also using a physical force, so PROPEL is also involved.
This is the first other search method that we are going to see.
Second is quite also.
Do you know the feeling of reading something but having no clue what the author is talking about? That’s what I felt when I read an article about chatbot technology for the first time.
In a machine translation application, it would take a sentence in one language, and output its translation in another.
After some time no ants will be travelling along path two.
As it started raining when he was paying, he called a cab service for returning home.
So, the point is researchers started working in the direction of designing or mimicking human brain by providing algorithms which can work that way, and there are many models in fact.
Now the most important part, we would like to solve travelling salesman problem using GA .
We need to score each word of the input sentence against this word. 
In this module we are going to see some other search methods, little better methods of searching.
C on top of D is deleted.
But then we have explored enough number of plies.
Instead of picking up one rule and find out if this node is better, what it does is explores everyone and pick up pick up the best one.
One, the heuristic value of this .
But that’s the reason why I have chosen a different set of string.
Now currently the knowledge is almost always coded in some form of classes because classes offer lot of advantages like inheritance and so on.
And also chicken and grain cannot be on that side, okay .
If farmer is on the left hand side he cannot be on the right hand side.
The first statement that you can encounter is MiniMax, the arguments are current state, current depth and current player.
Similarly, ‘fly’ also involves something else happening. ‘Fly’ means you you you took a plane to reach to that place, so that is the additional information.
B says it as minus five is not very good for us, C seven is far better, D is three and E is minus one.
These are the standard ways to preprocess image in a computer vision task.
Solution space is okay Solution but it won’t search like other search methods that we have seen so far.
If it is not, the plan is not valid.
Hello Friends! We have already seen few things about AI and search methods.
You can see rule number nine is applied, then four, then eleven, then one, then nine again and then two and eleven.
The ‘reason’ is terrorists attacked Mumbai.
But we cannot just arbitrarily add or remove components, we’ll have to apply actions and we cannot even apply actions arbitrarily, we’ll have to make sure that the prerequisites for that action must exist and if it is not there we have to generate that state with a precondition for which we’ll have to apply some other action.
What are the expectations?
A chatbot builder it’s a platform that allows you to build and launch chatbots with little or no coding.
A recursive function is a function, where a call to itself is made somewhere in between, so whatever you've done before is called winding phase and the next phase is the recursive call to that function.
Okay .
So, that that is probably the meaning that you get out of that.
In fact it is not good, obviously because you're not exploring all nodes.
When the product catalog of an online store is extensive, machine translation is quite commonly used for translating product information.
So, that's called the direction relationship.
For a serious case, you have a lot of other information, for example, it involves events like tossing and lunch and and tea and all that in a cricket match and also about the sequence in which order this happens, the toss happens in the beginning and then only then the match starts, and then you have innings, and there is a lunch break, and there is a tea break and so on so forth.
how can we provide that?
And if you have that context ready, the ontology is ready, how the objects are related?They’re ready.
How much to reduce?
Not only that, there's one more thing.
Now, if you increase the summation, the value is available on on on the y axis, larger the summation, higher the value, more the value.
Well, there is something similar available but is not basically heuristic function, something very, very different.
They say that, it is impossible for such a network to even differentiate between the values which are exoar .
Remember the idea.
For example, if you want to recognize a signature, the problem itself is quite fuzzy, not only the problem is fuzzy though we are able to effectively solve that problem, we will be able to recognize a signature, we’ll not be able to tell exactly how we have done it.
So, a relevant progression moving from start space to the end state can easily be understood by having it does something which removes something which is there in start state but not in goal state and adds something which is there in the end state but not in the start state.
What is the value of N in the previous example?
So, once it finds that thing similarities it doesn't need to worry because it's there in the start state, it is also there in the end state you don't need to change them.
Now thats little surprising, what variable neighbourhood could be?
I give you a simpler problem to solve.
So that is the scripts were quite static.
Some authors describe the layer at the end.
Please understand opponent has two options.
The same process actually is used in simulated annealing.
How many times you were wrong?
If you know how to write heuristic function whatever we’re going to talk about is perfectly alright.
One, is a three gallon water jug, the other one is four gallon water jug and we have ample supply of water.
When you you go to restaurant after ten-fifteen experience you you probably expect everything waiters and all that very, very clearly.
We’ll not explore complete game trees in most cases.
We used two components, one which is an actual distance.
Lot of people came out with lot of models and plenty of model that exists in literature.
But then there is some difference here, okay .
So can we go to some other node?
So, the the the reasoning that they had is buried inside their that thing.
One ply search is shown on in inferior twenty point one, it is it is shown you can see that A is explored and it's a max ply because it is the only one ply search you just play or move and get all straights possible.
Again this is a very very important issue when you write any recursive algorithm.
Harvard’s NLP group created a guide annotating the paper with PyTorch implementation.
So, A is to be placed on table, then you achieve free B.
The only draw drawback of this system is that it it takes more time and more memory , obviously because it it it starts all over again every time.
For example, color of skin and all that are almost similar.
Internal emails and other written communication
The idea is when when you say that I had five hundred rupees, I went to Jungle Book and had my dinner.
So that is what you do.
So this is what GA is all about.
Okay , waiters and menu and everything is added, Okay .
You can have the top row or the last column okay .
And then eight and then ten, Okay .
Now, we are going to study in little more detail.
By 1985, the market for AI had reached over a billion dollars.
So, if that is the case, you will have a look for and get that, actually once he gets this thing , he will meet expert and then try to make sure that expert understands whether he has learned that thing.
So, this is called degree of freedom, I don't have the the degree of freedom I should.
Sometimes you say, you find a little bit better statement like Sachin flew to Los Angeles from Mumbai.
We we generate okay .
Similarly, M two plus M the the number of missionaries now we are going to have on the right hand side, must be greater than or equal to number of cannibals on the right hand side.
Modern machine capabilities generally classified as AI include successfully understanding human speech, competing at the highest level in strategic game systems (such as chess and Go), autonomously operating cars, intelligent routing in content delivery networks, and military simulations.
We have X Y Z in in in the jug.
It has some small set of system calls sixty three and any command that you type actually is converted to some form, some combination of those system calls to get the job done.
Here the computers use electromagnetic waves you know .
There is something else called Ordinal Representation.
And it has few places to go but almost all places are occupied.
Ram Ram has done something to Ravan.
So, and then they narrow it down and then try all possible cases generate and test there.
There's no missionary actually.
For example, if I want want to find out minimum between one three and five, then I is minus one minus three and minus five.
So, when you design these forms and reports, let the normal user read and understand what it is.
So, very, very important thing is to have no redundancy in the knowledge.
okay , and you will have to have plans, various plans for but design, as I said is not as detailed as the conventional one, is usually kind of ‘let it evolve’ kind of situation here.
If you use sparse what you can do is you can just replace it by the remaining.
We might end up being on on top of local minima.
So, let me again brief.
So there is no question of invoking that script.
Friends, let us begin with the the second module.
So what you do is, you just check for those impossibilities.
That means there is a black pawn at position i and j and j equal to seven.
With that we’ll come to an end of this particular module .
Now you can clearly see that path one is little shorter.
E F G H is not six twelve or four.
And that that’ll help in generalization, because if you identify features irrespective of the input, the pixel value is, it it becomes possible, it it it makes it possible to generalize.
So, when I say I'm throwing a stone, actually that involves more than one primitives.
You can see 3,5,0 is the next one, 0,5,3 is the next one, 3,5,0, now that’s the dead end.
A complex algorithm is often built on top of other, simpler, algorithms.
Attributes
Hello friends, welcome to Module Five, Heuristic Search Methods in Artificial Intelligence series of modules.
Eventually you will find that you will have all missionaries and cannibals on the right hand side.
We have written a function, we are of function call only.
So, you can see that EXPEL is is the verb which is being used here, okay .
I have not written that.
But when KE observes the expert, he’ll learn a lot about that.
We will only be able to use legal moves.
In fact, not only that is better to represent, it is also better to code and run faster .
okay So, when the terminating criteria is reached you have to come back.
For two reasons.
So what people do it they do it empirically and find find out.
The problem itself moving from one state, for example, moving from Ahmedabad to to Vadodra how how you do that.
SEF is a Static Evolution Function is many a times is not a single entity.
Single point crossover is not possible here. Okay .
Is it a relevant thing?
Let's see text detection and recognition in action in the following code.
So, it does a simple thing.
The first thing, for an input, for example, I I am taking a very simple case of recognizing an image.
Robot is is a very important applications of AI.
That means total amount of milk that we can have is eight.
Now what you do is, now you have those offspring, the older one are are thrown away,
So you can't conclude everything. So this is again an example of the power of script.
When these three lines remain active, these three hidden units become active, the unit which wants to learn to become active and A is presented, will learn to become active.
So, an important job here is to see whether we have invoked a script.
the new generation takes place,
I have few moves possible.
And if you start taking the other path A to B and D, it's already crossing two fifty and you you won’t go further.
The value is and remember static evolution function only applies at this place.
It is not very similar to something that we have studied so far.
And all four of the prerequisites must match , okay .
So this is the slide actually talks about one example, fingerprint.
Unwinding part on the contrary is very important here because that happens in in in the reverse order.
Remember we would like to remove components which are there in the start state, not in the end state.
Then curved can have big curves and small curves, and round, can have long rounds and small rounds and so on and so forth. Okay .
So, exploring next ply will require almost thirty-five percent thirty five times more than the current ply.
So, for example, I assume that for correct image, the output should be one and I get one.
So, the M two, remember the original number of missionaries on the right hand side were M two.
And whatever is remaining is is here.
What is the consequence of it?
the new generation is going to replace the old generation in this case.
And second what we want is is is is to make the program more intelligent , program to solve the problem itself, not the designer solving it and hard coding it in the program.
Much of AI research involves figuring out how to identify and avoid considering a broad range of possibilities unlikely to be beneficial.
The other one ‘Sachin did not’, in fact, the negation part, ‘going to a restaurant.
And using artificial neuron they tried to solve those complicated seemingly complicated problems.
So, that is what is being done here.
That is why it is allowed in GAs .
And please understand that there are seventeen odd rules that we are going to look at.
So, in the next rollout, they they they make all these changes and next version they change.
So this is what I get A, B, C, D, G, F, I, H, E so this is what I get.
We’ll use sigmoid function sigmoid function is used here.
So obviously we need to have unexplored nodes.
If search path is going beyond that minimum value, it terminates that itself there and refinement search which acts over a solution space and and does exactly the same as branch and bound.
You may ask me how have I decided rule number one to be applied.
clears throat Okay .
It’s not an object, okay .
What does that mean?
And when that is that is very, very required this is the search method to go for.
So, when you talk about representing fly, you have few other things rather than additional, in addition to be PTRANS .
In this particular module we extend our discussion about planning that we had earlier in the previous module.
Okay .
It’ll give you a good solution, but not optimal solution. Branch and bound on the other hand will give you yes, optimal solution.
So A, B, C, D, E, F, G is a same tours as G, F, E, D, C, B, A okay the reverse path is the same.
So, that is the issue.
So that we cannot generalize, so we are not talking about, we just assume that PMG exists, will generate nodes for us, so that is assumed .
Okay , and and and when you talk about MTRANS , information comes from various sources.
Okay , so let us see what heuristic search methods are.
The object is stick.
So, the first condition is satisfied.
It says that Sachin did not go to restaurant as terrorists attacked Mumbai.
And one great thing about MOP is that because it stores everything together, it can relate two different things and and one example of a program called Swale is very interesting.
The actor acting on that object.
Now, try to understand.
Now there is an automated cook service, Okay , which Jay enters all this information into his system.
So, we have the last one is W one M one okay .
This task is a prerequisite will have to be delayed.
Okay , the next one is Sachin gave his bat to Sarfaraz, I I won't talk about this.
Slow if you continue , if you do that process in a slow manner , the problem is that it takes a lot of time.
So, this is what it does.
And if the output is wrong, it floats those errors back and that's why because of this, the algorithm is known as back propagation.
So, something which is removed should not be there in the goal state or if it is there in the goal state, we have done something wrong because we wanted and we have removed it
But anyway, we are we are not discussing that part right now.
Ram did something to to kill Ravan.
In fact, there are many ways of doing it.
So, you may not use them but you will find them.
Apply the first rule, if it is better go to that node, Okay .
One benefit of Acolad’s machine translation service is that a file can be attached to the machine translation order; there is no need to cut and paste the text.
So, the longer the path, less the pheromone value.
You may think why it is done that way?
That that slide talks about the power of that white pawn.
Unguided Search is used at two cases, there is not enough domain knowledge, we don’t know, Okay .
In the goal state if you see goal state A is on the table in the initial state it is not on the table.
Obviously, I want to identify not only A but if suppose if I'm interested in finding out all uppercase letters.
Now, please understand the action is applied like this so previous to new.
Now, that second level of tree.
So, that that is important.
So, action adds something.
In the previous module, we have seen simple eight, five, three gallon water jug problem
It's not found in other problem other problem solving methods that we have seen.
So, that is X one to X eighty-one information provided okay .
What is solution?
This is obviously simple.
How it is done?
Now, you can see that, what does that mean?
The opponent is not playing so we’ll choose the best.
They try to access the server, the server is not responding.
The idea of using simple systems and combining them, the the power is quite unique.
One of the great things about CD is that it becomes language independent once you convert the statement into CD .
The chicken and the farmer, both of them can go on the right side and the job is done.
One of the method is called Nearest Neighbour algorithm which helps in finding out the the quite optimal solution for travelling salesman problem.
We will be looking at that algorithm in the next module.
We’ll be looking at one or two very very powerful algorithms of using neural networks, okay .
The child one is B, G, A child two is B, D, E and that is what we mean by mapping.
So, when I'm suggesting something, probing something as an expert, why should I be doing it?
The Ordinal Representation actually allows single point crossover which was not possible in path representation.
In this blog post, we will explain which text types are best suited for machine translation.
So it will happen a few times.
The process is basically descending and not ascending like hill climbing.
Now you can see that there are two different conceptualization and there this shows a relationship between them.
And if it recognizes it is fine, if does not recognize you will have to change those weights, okay .
It’s that simple.
So, that's a very, very critical part of this.
With this, I would like to end this particular module.
How this is related to GA ?
Still, we have achieved good results with the EAST model and Tesseract.
And the next three columns actually describe the rule applied, number of missionaries moving on the right hand side, number of cannibals moving on the right hand side.
Then you have the middle layer in remember middle layer you have total N units.
I can solve it but can a computer program do it?
I I want that less than twenty-two if something is more than that the path is of no interest to me.
So, when the total is six, that means only farmer only fox and chicken is there on the right side, which we do not want .
So what you do?
There there are other cough there are other objects- menu and rate card or menu and tablecloth, plates and glasses and so on so forth.
My king is under attack kind of.
If missionary is one cannibal can be one or zero.
And if you look from that angle, it is one two four and eight .
One learns to become active and there is a slanting line moving from left to right up.
The transcription layer converts the per-frame made by RNN into a label sequence.
You may be surprised why should we talk about Unguided Search as we have already seen that most of the AI problems require heuristics and this Unguided Search Methods don't use.
5,3,0 one output is 3,5,0 and 5,0,3 both of them are already explored so we’ll not look at them. The rest of the tree is just explored the same way.
When I'm talking about Ramlal or somebody, a greater than average, that average, that height is little lesser, okay .
It can also be used as inter lingua actually, so if if you convert an English statement into a CD form, that CD form can be converted to any other language.
We we have seen that is a limitation of CD .
See, we’re not doing exploring it like hill climbing, Okay .
And after implementation planning, obviously the last phase implementation starts.
The set of genetic information is encoded in human genome.
If after a move, I have the peace advantage I’ll more number of pieces than the opponent has, I have a piece advantage.
So it begins with A.
We begin with the the leaf nodes, then start backing values up.
So, here there is an additional memory provided ontological memory and obviously it has the other memory called episodic memory which is almost the same as scripts.
When use GA and and on problems like this it is not easy for you to combine them by using a single point crossover like cutting the tour into half here, and cutting the other two into half and just combine them, because the cities maybe repeated and sometimes cities may be omitted, so that is not is not allowed, that is why we need little different type of crossover methods, there are three crossover methods we have seen, one is called partially mapped where a small part of one parent is copied into children and based on that mapping the rest of the elements are filled up.
What you're supposed to do is to provide some images of G with and some images without that horizontal line.
May Maybe one more way of doing it is to pick up something which is not used before, okay , some rare kind of a step.
Every rule has some prerequisite.
C is free but D is not free.
But the Sigma is basically summing up everything that comes in.
So, the every image contains some pixels which are black some pixels which are white.
So, given an option, opponent will obviously pair.
So, there may be more and this again we are talking about real systems, where there are more than one correct responses, which is quite possible we are we are dealing with real It is quite possible that one expert says that malaria, the other says typhoid and the patient actually has both of them.
That person will not back it up okay ?
So, that is possible.
You you cannot explore the entire level further but you can explore that node further.
So, that the next rule it says X Y Z, Y plus Z greater than or equal to five , you have X five though this is completely full.
You may try.
How do you find out?
So that is the earlier case plus the decrement.
Earlier case was different, okay .
We cannot because this this particular node has lesser heuristic value.
it’s more likely they travel back on the same path and it attracts more number of ants, okay .
W is win,L is loss and D is draw.
Opponent would like to go further because draw is not all that important for it it’ll go further and try to get L.
The opponent may start the The first case, it is MiniMax start state zero and one .
Welcome friends in the eighth module of AI , genetic algorithms and travelling salesman problem.
If you if you look mathematically, a random set of N weight is a point in an N dimensional space.
The job is done.
Such systems can still be benchmarked if the non-goal system is framed as a system whose goal is to successfully accomplish its narrow classification task.
So, that is a conceptualized in the lization that we see in rule number seven.
Here the example is Nobita ate rice with a stick.
So what you’re doing?
We are not going to lose any our game there.
Okay .
With that we’ll come to an end of this module.
Let me tell you, No Why?
In March 2016, AlphaGo won 4 out of 5 games of Go in a match with Go champion Lee Sedol, becoming the first computer Go-playing system to beat a professional Go player without handicaps.
Those bits are what, zero and one.
So, those numbers, the order also is not going to be similar in in other if you refer to some other material.
Just look at the hidden unit which it it just look at 3 hidden units.
What does it mean?
Now, that is my initial state.
Now the preconditions .
Toh it cannot come down directly.
okay The reason okay of Ravan’s health going to minus ten is this.okay .
The left hand side we had M one.
Now, you can see that the same relationship and the object is Ravan.
YOLO is single-shot techniques as you pass the image only once to detect the text in that region, unlike the sliding window.
So, second one is little better and it is not going to lead us to draw, lose if you if you see that, that thing, the second move, there's no chance that we'll get a lose okay .
There is no need for the produced content to be available in only one language when the material can be effortlessly translated into other languages.
The study of mechanical or formal reasoning began with philosophers and mathematicians in antiquity.
Something similar you probably have done if you are science student and have tried to find out ions of a given given chemical compound.
Okay , let us look at this figure.
According to Bloomberg's Jack Clark, 2015 was a landmark year for artificial intelligence, with the number of software projects that use AI within Google increased from a sporadic usage in 2012 to more than 2,700 projects.
However, this is nearly impossible when the company has sites all over the world.
Here the MOPs are a little more dynamic.
Look at the the sigmoid function you will be able to see.
So, that is susbtracted and then union is with free C and free D.
The biggest benefit, however, comes from how The Transformer lends itself to parallelization.
Free X and Free Y.
So, that's precisely what is happening here.
Now we do not explore all the nodes, we only explore the leftmost.
The other important thing about CD is that it captures the meaning of a statement, rather than just showing links about the words that those are used in the statement, rather than providing that superficial understanding of what the statement is about.
Not only that, we have many heuristics possible, we have already talked about heuristics.
If it is possible for us to apply this action now and the action should convert a state into some other state where something which was there in the final state in the previous state should not be there if it is not there in the start state. And something which is not there in the start state in the goal state, it should be removed and something which is there in the start state should be added okay .
Now the first statement, first line which says L one two four eight and R zero zero zero zero, what does it mean?
So but you can see that the the the rule description D and three prong structure with one source the other one destination and the object on which this this thing is happening.
Now let us look at the summary of what we have looked at this module, in the heuristic search module.
Why?
Virtual infinity is obviously not infinity but then real time you’ll not be able to handle that, so that’s also it's called virtual infinity.
State space representation means, I'm defining all states using the simple formula.
One important aspect of the process is moving from the initial state to the final state.
So what you do is,
We’ll just look at a typical sequence of states and see if it is a valid state, acceptable one, if not then we’ll pick up the something else and so on, that’s called perturbation search.
Because the problem is less structured.
And for example, we’ll take a missionary cannibal program problem.
Why you want to go to dine?
You can see that this three A's which are shown here are quite different to each other.
So, it's basically an algorithm.
It’s calling PMG and PMG generates children for that particular node.
Colloquially, the term artificial intelligence is often used to describe machines (or computers) that mimic cognitive functions that humans associate with the human mind, such as learning and problem solving.
Now how that is changed?
BFS and DFS will find solution eventually if the search space is finite.
A relevant state is where it moves towards the goal stack okay .
Why?
What we have seen in this particular module.
And the cyclic crossover, we what we do is we we pick up an element from parent one and pick up a corresponding element in parent two and pick up that element, and use that position to to store that in in the, to to copy that thing in the child and so and so forth.
This way, even texts containing business secrets can be translated using machine translation.
Let me tell you there is no theoretical guarantee of this process.
You’re actually you start with minus three then zero then two then four. You reach to four.
What we want is obviously A to be on table.
But but the scripts are basically like this very example but it's still a very good example for you to understand different stakeholders of this thing, Okay .
The network architecture has been taken from this paper published in 2015.
You try you try for class I, then class II, then class III, then class IV.
C on top of D is it part of the start state?
The meaning is that Nobita is doing something with the stick, which enables which which is an instrument for Nobita to eat rice.
Let us see why we are discussing about GAs .
For example, a manoeuvering program in chess probably looks at a million states during the the the chess playing session.
The same summation is calculated but then what you have is one upon one plus e raise to minus sum , you just calculate it that way, it is there shown on the screen that you you better see that yourself, okay , so this is called sigmoid function.
So, a tolerance level is point one.
For example, when I'm here to detect intrusion, I should not waste my time finding out differentiating between different attacks.
I’ve already told you, when you explore a search tree or a graph, the difference between search tree and a graph is, a a graph will a child will have a point that is quite possible that will also point to a parent.
The actors can be of two different types.
I’ve already talked about this, the the string X which are interested in checking and all this thing . If it does not hold the process will not stop.
So, that is again very critical point here in the implementation.
If the script writer has actually provided typical scenes, which can indicate, why one can get angry?
Almost all AI problems what my point is almost all AI problems are harder than what you see what what what you find them at the first glance.
But a more important thing is, I must have some clear means of telling which move is better.
Voice recognition systems and face detection systems and there many, many similar systems used in practice which, in sense using back propagation algorithm.
The sequence of events following in a default way obviously they are scenes and these are the most important things.
Surprising? We are doing it in fact.
See the process.
You can refer one of my previous article to understand techniques for object detection, in our case text detection.
Not only that, it's kind of pick keeping the best so far node as well.
It could be a website, LiveChat, Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, Slack, Kik, etc.
We'll see what exactly each part is doing in this particular algorithm.
What does that mean?
So, that is one upon one plus E raised to minus summation and the summation we've already seen okay .
That value is, we have assumed that value is four.
Don’t ask me further, I don’t know.
Often, all relevant information is recorded for future reference, either for development actions or just for maintenance.
okay , If In most cases, we do it that way only.
You have to continue doing it unless and until you get the final result.
So, the programmer has to just convert, map this thing into that programming syntax.
okay , The same thing can be shared in hundred odd ways or even more ways if you are a poet or somebody like that.
Integrated machine translation systems are commonly used in social media services where the posts of users can be translated into the reader’s own language with a single click.
to that algorithm decides.
Which move and why?
Or when I travel by bus and so on, so forth.
We are going in depth, we are not exploring it, we just take a left root, left root, left root, left root. Go.
And the other one is eight five three gallon milk jug problem.
It just combines Y plus Z, obviously the the middle jug in that case will contain no milk .
And it's not an algorithm.
Minus three and two now they’re explored.
When you deliberating over where to move and there is a sudden obstacle, you'll have to take an immediate left movement or something
We will use some of the images to show both text detection with the EAST method and text recognition with Tesseract 4.
I'll talk about that soon what I mean, okay . You may do that, for example, you may just pick up top five, okay , nodes in chess kind of , okay and pick up the best at the end.
Now, there are two things happening – ‘terrorists attacking Mumbai.’
Now we go further and find out the actual distance.
Okay , now we're talking about the third case - The eight gallon jug and three gallon jug.
Now, in in look at the weights okay .
Now, again you will come across the same dilemma that you had before.
And it is quite possible that you traverse some futile, useless states.
So, that's the case.
They are not inputs.
Pick up the next node and refine solution with that node, calculate the total distance to be covered.
So, the artificial neuron you can see that it is pretty simple design.
So the algorithm , the back-propagation algorithm is all about processing like this.
Please understand.
And we have seen how one can write the state space.
Sigmoid because it is continuous, it is possible to differentiate and differentiation is very required.
It it is not.
