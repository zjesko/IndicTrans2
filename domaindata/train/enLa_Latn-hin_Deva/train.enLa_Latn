Hello!
Everybody.
Welcome to the MOOCs Corporate Law program.
I am Aakriti Kohli researcher, National Law University Delhi.
I hope you guys are learning a lot and reading the other modules as well.
As the present module is in the continuation of the earlier module that was on Mergers, Acquisitions and Takeovers.
I am going to take you through the recent cases of mergers and acquisitions in India.
These cases basically pertain to the year 2014-15 and 16.
Where India had witnessed lot of M&A activities.
The basics of mergers and acquisition has already been covered in the previous module.
I sincerely hope that you people have understood the fundamentals of mergers and acquisitions in India.
Nevertheless as a revision, I would take you through the basic difference that exist between mergers and acquisitions.
If you look at the difference between merger and acquisition, merger is the merging of two organization into one.
Whereas an acquisition is buying one organization by another.
Merger is a mutual decision whether acquisition can be a friendly takeover as well as an hostile one.
Merger is expensive than acquisition because it involves higher legal cost.
However acquisition is less expensive than merger.
Through merger shareholder can increase the net worth whereas in acquisition buyers cannot raise enough capital.
Merger is less time consuming and the company has to maintain so many legal However acquisition is faster and an easier transaction.
In merger, there is dilution of ownership whereas acquisition acquire does not experience the dilution of ownership.
The details of mergers and acquisition has already been discussed in the previous module.
In the present module I am basically going to discuss the recent cases pertaining to the M&A transactions.
So ,the main ones which I am going to cover is related to Sun Pharma and Ranbaxy, PVR and DT Cinemas, Lupin and Gavis, Ola and Taxi for sure and Myntra and Jabong.
Through these cases, you will able to better understand the practicalities of the transaction and also the entities that have been involved the what actually happens when an merger and acquisition takes place.
Which would involve the change in the culture.
That would involve the change in the people, brand, product etc.
So, coming to the first case that is Ranbaxy Laboratories and Sun Pharmaceuticals.
As far as the transaction details are concerned when there is such kind of merger then what would happen? Under this merger has been touted as one of the biggest M&A deals in India.
So under the agreement, Ranbaxy shareholders will receive 0.8 shares of Sun Pharma for each share of Ranbaxy.
This exchange ratio represent and implied volume value of rupees 457 for each Ranbaxy share.
A premium of 18% to Ranbaxy 30 day volume weighted average share price and a premium of rupee of 24.3 % to Ranbaxy’s 60 day volume weighted average share price.
So this is basically what would be Ranbaxy shareholders would get when it merges into Sun Pharma.
And what would be the value of each share which they held previously in Ranbaxy.
Now, the transaction is expected to represent a tax- free exchange to Ranbaxy share holders who are expected to own approximately 14% of the combined company on a pro forma basis.
Why this merger was the need of the hour because it was a crucial time for Ranbaxy.
If we go into the Ranbaxy’s past, you would see company has been incurring significant losses and suffering a decline in net worth since 2011.
Which can be attributed to few key circumstances.
These basically includes settlement amount of US dollar 515 million.
Paid to the U.S. Department of Justice that is D.O.J.
In May 2013, after Civil and criminal charges were lodged against Ranbaxy pertaining to the data and irregularities found in two of its facilities in India.
Thus the merger of the company with Sun Pharma comes at a crucial time when Ranbaxy was already struggling to improve its financial position and many irregularities had also been highlighted.
If you look at the regulatory approval that were involved because as you have read in the previous module for a mergers and acquisition to happen.
They are set of regulatory approvals that are required to be done, either it is from high court or it is from the competition commission or from the registrar office.
By August 2014, Sun Pharma and Ranbaxy had obtained clearances from both the stock exchanges in India NSE and BSE as well as from anti-competitive authorities in all applicable markets except India and US.
The CCI had also interestingly scrutinized this deal and approve the acquisition of Ranbaxy by Sun Pharma on December 5th, 2014 but there were some preconditions that were involved.
Which was that 7 brands constituting less than 1% of the total revenue of the combined entity in India be divested in order to prevent the merger from negatively impacting competition in the market.
So ,there were some divestment that was required to be done.
So that the combined consolidated entity does not become dominant in the relevant market.
On February 2nd, 2014 , both companies announce that US FTC that is the Federal Trade Commission had granted early termination of the waiting period under the hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust improvement Act of 1976.
Coming to the cinemas now, as we all know PVR Cinemas and DT Cinemas.
There was at acquisition that was involved.
This is the India's leading multiplex operator PVR Cinemas which has acquired real estate, DLF cinema which is DT Cinemas for rupees 433 Crores.
Now pursuant to the deal PVR took over the operations of 32 screens of DT Cinemas from June 1.
Initially the deal was for 39 screens valued at 500 Crores, but due to the regulatory tussles and because of the scrutinisation of the deal by Competition Commission of India, the deal had come from 39 screens to 32 screen leading to the the lessening the value of the deal.
This was again a major consolidation that had happened in the recent past.
If you look at the regulatory approval and the competition concerns that are involved.
So, this deal was brought under the CCI scrutiny.
Now the commission had ordered some systematic changes that were to make to be required in the deal.
These include commission and ordered to exclude 2 properties of the DT Cinemas.
This was basically done so that the PVR does not become a dominant entry in most of the markets in Delhi and NCR.
So the commission had ordered to exclude two properties of DT Cinemas that was in DT-Savitri that is 1 screen and DT Saket 6 screens.
So that would remain under the ownership of DT Cinemas and PVR Cinemas will not acquire the same.
That is again a much welcomed order.
The watchdog had also asked the PVR to offload some of its assets in order to approve the transaction.
In pursuance of the order, PVR agreed to scrap its plans.
So there were some new plans for the investments were required to be done by the PVR but for the time being those investments are kept at hold as the commission head specifically asked PVR to delay those investments.
And those investment which were basically under construction projects of PVR which included Garden Galleria Mall in Noida and a 7 screen property at Airia mall in Gurgaon.
PVR has also agreed not to spend in these 2 regions organically or via acquisitions for the rest of 3 years.
As part of the deal, DT Cinemas has been asked by the CCI to sell the other 7 screens in South Delhi to any other competitor except PVR.
So, this is the major, if you see this is an attempt to see that the merging entity does not become dominant in the market.
So Commission has done a really good job by actually suggesting that the PVRs should not acquire particular DT Cinemas which are located in Savitri.
Savitri which is 1 screen and DT Cinemas Saket that is 6 screens.
Now the road ahead, what would be the impact on overall market after this deal.
The impact would be after merger PVR presence will increase to 141 locations with 551 screens in 46 cities across India.
The largest multiplex operator in India now has 519 screens in 133 locations.
PVR will be able to add 7,939 of DT Cinema’s seats, taking its tally to 126 to 672.
Its closest competitor INOX operator over 420 screen followed by Mumbai-headquartered Carnival Films with 330 screens.
So this basically gives you an idea who all will be the major players that will operate in our country after this consolidation and what are the screens that we can expect them to own.
So you can just go through the instant slide and see what is the road ahead that lies for cinemas in our country.
This is another major deal that has happened in the pharmaceutical sector.
Lupin Limited and Gavis Pharmaceuticals and Novel laboratories.
Lupin limited, as you know is one of the large third largest Indian pharma company, which has completed the acquisition of privately held.
So, Gavis Pharmaceutical is a privately held US Pharma company.
So there has been a recent acquisition by Lupin of US privately held Gavis Pharmaceuticals.
Now Lupin has announced this deal to acquire Gavis for dollar 880 million in a bid to strengthen its presence in US market.
So this move of Lupin was mainly to strengthen is present in the US market because there will be lot of synergies involved if Lupin acquires Gavis Pharmaceuticals addition to the manufacturing plant.
The takeover gives Lupin a combined portfolio of 120 US approved generic drugs.
what is the synergy set are involved.
Once the Lupin acquires Gavis Pharmaceutical what will it get? It would get access to 120 us approved generic drugs and 185 pending ANDA applications.
Now what are these ANDA applications? Its abbreviated New Drug Applications, including first 2 file that is FTF products offering 180 day market exclusivity.
These are all the benefits that are involved once a Lupin acquires Gavis.
These are mutual synergies that are always involved in an in a consolidation.
So it would get access to the generic drugs that are being manufactured by Gavis.
It would get access to ANDA applications that have been filed by Gavis.
So this is a huge stake that is involved once the Lupin acquires Gavis and it would have its present in the US market as well.
Now going on to the regulatory approvals, of course it wasn't easy if you look at it the takeover was approved by US FTC on the condition Gavis sold assets for 2 generic products.
Those product are mesalamine and monohydrate to rival G and W.
So, this was mainly done so that once these entities merged, once there consolidated they do not get they they are not in control of most of the generic drugs.
So the control should be given to the other entities as well.
So that the drugs are made accessible to the common man.
Gavis would make mesalamine for G and W and give firm access to knowledgeable production staff to allow the firm to seek FDA approvals for the product.
US FTC felt that the acquisition will be anti-competitive and to preserve competition Lupin and Gavis will have to sell the right and assets for to generic drugs.
Of this one, one is used to treat bacterial infection and other to the ulcerative colitis.
Now what are the outcomes and resulting synergies.
As I have already mentioned whenever there is a merger or an acquisition the resulting synergies or benefits or contributions that are involved for both the entities.
So if you look at the outcome in the resulting synergies, Gavis brings to Lupin a highly skilled US based manufacturing and research organization which would complement its Florida based R and D Centre for inhalation products.
So, of course Lupin would also spread its wings in the US market and Gavis would provide all the necessary facilities that are required for Lupin to access the US drug market.
The combined company will have a portfolio of over 120 in-market products, more than 185 cumulative filings pending approval and a deep pipeline of products under development for the US.
So these are the basics synergies that are involved in this deal.
#Course Name: Corporate LawDirectors, Position, Appointment, Qualification, Power, Duties and Liabilities:My self Dr. Ashish Kumar Srivastava L.L.M. , Ph.D. Assistant Professor Faculty of Law, University of Lucknow will be making this presentation before you.
In this presentation the directors of the companies are the core issue.
As we know that the company is made for maximization of profits by buying and selling goods and services.
And in the process of buying and selling goods and services we need very enthusiastic people who can take decisions in the best interest of the company in a optimum way, for the better management of the wealth as well as the better management of services of the workforce.
So we see the directors and the company stand hand in hand.
The company cannot run without directors because directors are like captain of the ship.
So if the directors are thinking in a similar or in a optimum manner wherein they are the best judge of the interest of the company the company will be smoothly functioning the company will be a profit making company otherwise the company will convert in a white elephant that is a loss making company.
And most of the PSU’s in India we are saying that, they are not doing good because they are not mind by good people.
And good people in corporate governance means the directors only,because the usual diseases which will be taken initially will be taken by the directors and they are subsequently confirmed by the shareholders of the company in the corporate governance process.
So the directors are need for optimum use of corporate resources in the best interest of company and they are very important people in the life of company.
And they being in that positions have huge potential wherein they can misuse their position for their personal and vested interest.
And now we can see that in the corporate governance regime of the India we have different types of directors and these directors get a place on the board of the company and as we know that board of the company just like cabinet in the parliament.
Wherein all important decisions are taken by the board and subsequently ,they are confirmed by the shareholders and we know that the corporate governance process also runs in the same line of the democracy where decisions are taken by rule of majority.
Moving on we will like to see now what would be the learning outcomes by this module.
The learning outcome of this module will be at the end of the module,you will be able to learn that who is the director? What is his position in the company? How a director is appointed in company? What are the qualifications of a director? How a director is removed from his office? What are the powers of a director? What are the duties of a director? What are the liabilities of a director?
Now switching over to the first issue that who is the director of the company.
Now we see that in the company affairs directors hold a very important positions and often they are known as executive of the company.
Some company name them President or Vice President also.
Certain companies name them governors are governing Council members also but you see the Indian Corporate Law therein the term Corporate law that may prescribe for these persons is simply the directors and in the directors we have different categories for different purposes.
But if you try to find out the definition then the old Act was defining the term director in a different way and the new Act is defining the term in a different way.
Now old Act was defining term director in a way wherein a director is any person, who occupies the position of Director, but now the term is defined in a different way and that is director means a director appointed to the Board of a company and this is much more comprehensive than the old definition that was there in the old Act.
So in the new definition we find that any person who is serving the board will be a director of the company.
Moving on if we see that who are the directors actually.
So the directors as the name suggest direct the company, company direct the direction where in the company will be steered for maximization of profit that is essentially the Crux of the definition.
And if we try to analyze the provision that is there in the companies at ,a very large area of sections cover the term director and the different dimensions of directors.
As we know now that only individuals can be appointed as director and Supreme Court in a very important case Oriental Metal Pressing Works Limited versus B.K. Thakoor, analyzed why we should have individual has directed because as I told you that the company is meant for maximization of profit obviously .
But it is also having certain moral obligations like employment like the development of the vicinity where it is situated and tax payment and the overall development of nation by having wealth are creating wealth and contributing to the GDP of the comp of the nation .
That's why Supreme Court hold that because directors play very crucial role in a Corporate Affairs of the company and if they do not take right decisions that would end up the companies in loss making concern.
And those companies are utilizing the corporate capital that is arranged by the shareholders.
So this is the People's money which is going in the corporation and upon which they are having an Empire erected.
And if they are not using it in a proper way they should be held accountable.
So this gives a very clear idea why the directors should be very important persons in the corporate life of the company.
Moving on, now would like to deal with a issue that what is the position of directors in the company? So regarding the position of the directors in the company we can see by three aspects .
The directors are either agents of the company, directors are either the officers of the company, directors are either the trustee of the company.
So in these three areas we can see that directors play very crucial role and because of their crucial role they are depicted as agent or the trustee, or the officers of the company.
So far so agent is concerned as we know in agency the agents are appointed by principal in order to establish, maintain and analyze the relationship of third parties with the principal.
And for that they have necessary authority also.
But in case of the directors, there is no such principle and there is no such appointment as agent.
And their authority with comparison to the agents are much more wide, much more pervasive, that's why actually speaking they look like but actually speaking they are not agents of the companies.
Moving onto the different dimensions about his role or positions in the company they are often termed as the trusties of the company.
As we know that trust is defined in a section 4 of the Indian Trust Act wherein the trust is created by an author for the beneficiaries which is managed by a management trustee.
But here also actually speaking there is no creator and there is no management Trustee role of the directors.
But we can say the directors are a bit ,in a sense it trustee of the company.
Moving on because we have defined now the officers and officers as default in the Companies Act ,new Act that is section 2 subsection 59 to subsection 60 wherein we find later director to be used and these directors are officers of the company .
Being officers of the company they are also held accountable in various sections of the Indian Companies Act.
So we can formally say the directors are officers of the company.
One issue which is left to be dealt with is whether directors are servant of the company or not or directors are the employees of the companies or not.
Speaking legally we can refer a case Lee versus Lee air farming Limited wherein the Lee versus old shareholder of the company as well as he was the director of the company as well as he was the pilot of the company .
So, this case clearly illustrates that the a director can equally be the employee of the company as well as a servant of the company.
If that is not prohibited by the articles of the company.
So, speaking about it director also can be a servant or an employee of the company.
So, this explains the legal positions of the director.
Now about the number of directors they are required in the corporate governance process in public company ,we need to have minimum 3 directors in private minimum 2 and the maximum number is 15 which can be raised by special resolution, if the requirement maybe.
Often we see that there is large size of Board and large size of board is not quite productive also because there may be deadlock in the management.
That's why now the companies Act that has kept the size of the Board very small that is maximum 15 minimum 2 or 3 as the case may be and that gives precisely better accountability ,better transparency in the corporate governance process.
Ones more there is once more provision that one woman director will be there on the board of the company and there will be one minority shareholders director in the board of the company.
So these features are very unique in the new Act wherein the minority director or the woman director will be representative the interest of their class.
So we can see that the Board is an amalgam where ,there are so many people coming in on the Board who are having a representation of so many interest.
Like on we see that now the board is also required to have independent director.
Earlier there was no provision in the Indian companies act regarding independent director but the provision was in the corporate governance class clause 49 of the listing agreement.
If the company is a listed company then the company has to sign a listing agreement wherein, if the chairman of the board is an outsider then the company need to have the one third of the companies as the independent director.
Now if the chairman of the board is an insider then two third of the company need to be the inside independent directors.
Now ,there is provision that out of the Board size one third has to be the independent director.
Moving on the Companies Act , new Companies Act that also provides for a cap regarding the inter-directorship that means that one person can be director in how many companies and the cap there is in case of public and private both companies the total number is 20 companies he can direct at a time.
But in case of public companies where the Enterprises are big he is need to or needed to be have this limit up to 10 companies only.
And this also shows that if your tasks are less you can manage the companies in a better way and most of the companies are turning to the last meeting concerned only because of the miss management on the part of the directors.
Now ,we will see how many types of directors are there in the corporate governance process and we see we have different nomenclature for different purposes and they serve different purposes on the board of the company.
There are interested directors, there are nominee directors, shadow directors, executive directors, non-executive directors, independent directors, celebrity directors, additional director, casual director, alternate director, women director, whole time director, retiring director, deemed director, minority director and managing director and chief managing director.
So, if we see that the vistas of the corporate governance in terms of board of directors is very colorful where all interests are getting representations.
Now we will see the appointment and qualification processes of these directors.
And regarding the appointment of directors there is a help providing by the stock exchanges of the India.
And we have Bombay Stock Exchange which maintains a database where in people can pick and choose the number of independent directors they want to have on the board.
So director database is a service which is maintain by the stock exchange where from people can be picked and choose who has a better knowledge about the corporate affairs of the company that is one thing.
Second requirement is they have to have director identification number in order to get their identity identified and this DIN number are director identification number they have to get and file with the ROC in the company information process.
After that there was a requirement in the old act that was regarding golden shares.
Golden shares basically are qualification shares where in the articles of the company provides that in order to be appointed in the company you are to have certain amount of shares.
But now this new Companies Act do not provide anything regarding qualification of shares are golden shares.
And because of that there is no requirement by the Indian Companies Act for the qualification of shares or qualification shares but if the company wants in order to attach the director with the company emotionally and sentimentally they can provide in the articles for the golden shares.
And golden shares bring better responsibility on the part of companies director.
So these are the affirmative qualifications which the director needs to have in order to get appointed.
Then there are certain disqualifications or negative qualifications which is mentioned in section 164 1 and 2.
164 section 164 of the Indian Companies Act basically provides for the disqualification of the directors wherein if a director has been declared incompetent and he has been declared incompetent in a way that he does not have a sound mind or he is of unsound mind then he will not be appointed as director.
And if he is un-discharged insolvent, if he is convicted for moral turpitude offences for 6 months and the cooling off period that is a 5 years is not elapsed, if he is convicted for serious offences with 7 years imprisonment, if he is disqualified by the National Company Law Tribunal, if he is convicted for related party transactions under section 188, then also he will not be appointed as a director.
And next disqualification is that if he is not responded the calls for the payment of prices regarding the share because we know that calling is a procedure where whenever the demand by the company is made regarding the payment of prices, the shareholder has to pay it.
So if he has defaulted in responding to the calls also he will not be appointed as a director.
Then one more disqualification is that if he has not received the DIN number and without having the DIN number a director identification number he is acting as a director he will be disqualified to be appointed.
Then if he is breaching the inter directorship limit which I have explained earlier that in case of public company he can be appointed directors only in 10 companies and in cases of other he can be maximum up to 20.
So he is breaching this limit he will be disqualified to be appointed as a director.
And then 164 section 164 plus 2 provide final and additional disqualification wherein only people who have a better track regard meaning thereby if they are in a process where in they have directed a company which is a loss making concern then they will not be given further chances.
It will virtually keep them on their toes and the provision is that if a director is a director of company which has defaulted to file its annual financial statement of 3 preceding financial year he will get no chance to be appointed in a new company.
So if we see that these qualifications as well as disqualifications meaning thereby affirmative and negative elements are very important in the appointment process where we are saying that this over people who are academic, who are business minded, who are moral also has a opportunity to direct the company in a better manner.
After having these qualifications as well as disqualification they will be appointed by the shareholders or by the board, or by the National Company Tribunal.
So now we will be dealing with the appointment process and if we see the appointment process of the company we have the three different types of appointment process.
The first is that the appointment by the shareholders.
The second is appointment by the board and the third is appointment by the National Company Law Tribunal or the third parties.
Now dealing with the first appointment by the shareholders: Section 152 of the Indian companies act provides that first directors of the company as the requirement is 2 and 3 in case of public and private they will be appointed by the company within the one year from the data fin corporation.
And if the company fails to appoint then the subscribers of the memorandum shall become the deemed director of the company and they will be also the first director of the company.
And subsequently all the directors will be appointed by the shareholders in a Annual General Meeting or General Body Meeting as we call it.
And in that appointment process one has to be cautious the depending upon the size of board certain reservations has to be made like one third independent directors will be there.
Two third directors of the whole size will be retiring directors.
And rest can be executive directors.
So mostly the executive directors are in house members of the company they are very closely associated for the formation process they are also initiating or furthering because of the company.
They are the in house number and the non executive directors are the IDs basically who are the outsiders and they are there to have better transparency and accountability feature.
Then after this appointment the board of director can also appoint certain directors and they are additional director, alternate director, casual director and this appointment process is discussed in section 161 when in additional director can be appointed when the appointment process by the general body is failed then to fill certain contingency or dis contingency the board of director can appoint directors who will be known as additional directors.
And if there is an absenteeism on the part of a director who is outside India for 3 months then for that we will appoint a alternate director and all other casual or other casual vacancies which is on account of illness on account of death or on account of inability can be filled in by casual directors.
So additional alternate and casual directors will be appointed by the board of directors.
Apart from this if the National Company Law Tribunal finds a situation that there is a miss management on the board then in order to control the management of the board they can also have their directors on the board and they are known as nominee directors.
And that can equally be done by the third parties who are giving loan or any kind of financial assistance to the company because those nominees will be seeing that the fund provided by these third parties are public financial institutions are being utilized for the right and resourceful for the right cause or not.
And whether the fund is not being diverted for the personal use.
So this is the appointment process in the corporate affairs of the company.
Now moving on we will like to deal with vacancy removal and resignation.
So far so resignation is concerned directors are free to resign from the company by signing a letter in writing.
So when they are tendering their resignation the resignation letter will be effected from the date of letter to be issued by them to the company.
And there can be vacancy and removal on certain disqualifications are these certain tainted qualifications which they are having while being appointed and that is mentioned in section 167 which says that a director shall have to vacate the office or shall be removed from the office if he is tainted with any disqualification which is mentioned under section 164 that I already discussed with you that is, if he is declared a person of unsound mind, if is declared and un-discharged insolvent, if is found to be guilty of moral turpitude offences, if is convicted for serious offences.
So for that he will be removed from his office and there will be an automatic vacancy in the office of the director.
And then the next clause is that if he absents himself from the meeting of the board for one year without explaining or without leaving any reason for this.
So in that situation also his office will be taken as automatically vacant and he will be removed from his office.
Next is if he is not disclosing his material interesting transactions with the companies having with a third party and if he appears to be an interested director then he is liable to vacate the office and he may be removed from the office as is mentioned in section 184 of the act.
He can equally be removed or his office will be vacant if he is disqualified by the National Company Law Tribunal if the Tribunal finds out that the company was being managed by person whose morals are not sound.
Moving on we will now deal with the powers of the board of directors and directors.
If we see the powers of the directors then the corporate life is basically having too many things and in that corporate life we have certain things which are very important and we have certain things which are not that important which may be superficial also.
So we can classify power into two sections regarding that certain powers are superficial powers or routine powers which are day-to-day business will be run on those.
And certain powers are substantial power.
So where the powers of substantial, the board of directors has to take collective decisions by board meetings and that would be a firm subsequently by the shareholders in the general body meeting.
But where powers are not that important those powers can be exercised either by one director in isolated capacity or by a committee of directors who have a delegation actually of those powers from board of directors.
So if we see what are the powers which a directors actually exercises in the corporate affairs.
We have to refer section 179 onwards and it goes from 179 to basically 185.
179 and 180 talks about those powers which can be exercised by the board of directors.
And those powers also which will be exercised board of directors plus the shareholders in the general body meeting.
So if we see the collective power they are mentioned in section 179 and they say general power general powers.
The general powers are all those powers which company can exercise and company can exercise borrowing powers as I told you company can exercise the contractual powers, company can exercise the proprietary powers and these powers basically are general powers.
But there is a further classification that the powers which are collective in nature meaning thereby that would be exercised by board and would be consented by the shareholders of the company.
They are many the first one is to make call.
The second is to authorize buy back.
Third to issue securities, IPO, debentures.
Third next to borrow moneys to invest in funds of the company inter corporate investment, to grants loans, to approve financial statement and boards reports, to diversify the business of the company, to approve amalgamation merger or reconstruction, to take over a company or acquire a controlling or substantial stake in another company or any other matter which is prescribed.
So if you see this power this power basically is exercisable by board of directors collectively but out of this certain power which is basically power to make call power, to authorize buyback power, to issue securities can also be delegated to the committee of directors by the board of directors.
Moving on we will now you see that what are those powers which run as a restrictions about the powers of the directors.
As we know the directors are having the general power as well as collective powers and there should be some check and balance regarding the abuse of the power.
That's why section 180 provides four specific categories where those will be running as a restrictions on the powers of the directors and these are especially attach with the diverging of the fonts diversion of the corporate funds, fussing of the accounts and illegally disposing of the properties of the company.
So if someone is trying to drain the company out of his assets then that can be held accountable under section 180 of the Companies Act.
It specifically provides to sell, lease or otherwise dispose of the value of the property to dispose of whole or substantially the whole of the undertaking of the company.
To invest interest securities amount of compensation received by it as a result of any merger and amalgamation, to borrow money, to remit or give time for the repayment of any death.
So these restrictions are limitations and the powers of the company.
Then there are certain other limitations and those limitations are mentioned in section 180 to 184 and 185.
Section 182 talks about political contribution and that is very controversial because the companies tries to influence the quality of a particular nation and thereby wants to have certain favorable decisions in their favor that's why the political contribution is limited that new companies cannot contribute to the political parties only old companies will contribute and those companies must be in the Corporate Affairs business for three financial years.
So they can contribute up to 7.5% of the net profits of the average of the three financial preceding years.
But a government company cannot contribute to any political party.
Then the next restriction on the power of the companies that the people who are interested in the material transactions they will not be allowed to be the party of those contractual agreement which the companies having with the third party meaning thereby that is also an outcome of a principle of administrative law that will know as the principal of biasness.
So if directors are having any personal interest they are biased in the transaction they should disclose it and if they disclose it they will not will let to take part in those transactions if they are taking part they will held accountable for the profit they are making in those transactions.
They are also criminally liable and then the next restriction is that they will not take any loan from the corporation because as I told you power to grant loan is a power which is actually initiated by the board and is confirmed by the shareholder but shareholders can easily be manipulated that there can be a firm in which the director is also a partner through that firm can fetch money from the a company where the director is employed.
That's why there is a restriction that if loan is granted to such a company that loan will be nullity in the eye of law but there is an exception that the management director and whole time director can be granted loan in recognition of their services.
So if we see that power have been granted but all these powers are running with limitations and this is the best in the interest of the shareholder as well as the other stakeholders of the company.
Now I will come to the duties of the director.
As we know the director stands in the fiduciary capacity to the company that's why he has duty to good faith duty of good faith, duty of reasonable care and duty not to delegate his powers.
These duties earlier were the common law duties which were made by these judgment laws.
Now they have been recognized well by the institute and they are mentioned in section 166.
They are moral or less same that if a director is there he will exercises his duty with due and reasonable care.
He will avoid conflict of interests.
He will not take any undue gain in any transaction that is being entered into by the company.
A director will also not assign his office he will not sale his public office and any assignment so made shall be void.
And if he breaching and office duty he shall punishable with fine which shall not be less than one lakh rupees but which may extend to five lakh rupees.
So we see now that those duties which have been identified by so many decisions in the common law countries they have been now recognized and made statutory duties in the New Companies Act.
Now if we try to find out that there are certain duties which are there in the institute mentioned particularly like as I told you the duty not to mislead the people by offer document section 34, 35, duty not to induce investors for buying shares, duty not to issue irredeemable preference shares, duty to file annual return, duty to hold statutory general meetings of the company, duty to maintain P&L account of the company, duty to ensure planning and execution of CSR that's very important feature in the new act.
That company has to contribute to the society also CSR feature section 135.
Then duty to get DIN as I told you Director Identification Number.
Then he has not to perform certain activities which I told you he will not make any political contribution.
He will not be interested director, he will also not give himself a loan by the company.
So if we see these are other duties which are mentioned that so many other places of the company.
So far so liability of the director is concerned because the director is in a fiduciary capacity of the company.
So if he breaches his liability then our duty then that results in liability also and he can be held accountable for ultra vires act.
He can be held accountable for negligence.
He can be held accountable for Mala Fide Acts.
He also owes liability to his co-fellows because if we see what is the liability aspect.
The liabilities is stands from one feature because he stands in fiduciary capacity to the company.
So if he is trying to do something beyond the powers of the company that stands as ultra vires.
As we know ultra vires doctrine is very old doctrine but even now this is a valid doctrine as was held in as very case that's a very landmark case in this regard.
Moving on the new companies act in order to ensure the fairness on the part of directors at various places hold him criminal liable, he can be made criminally liable for misstatement in prospectus, he can be made liable for criminally liable for issue of bonus shares, discounted shares, irredeemable preference shares, calling and falsification of share certificate.
He can also be made personally accountable criminally liable for filing not return, not filing return, for not holding AGM, for not distributing the dividends, for not getting the DIN number, for exceeding the maximum limit of inter-corporate directorship.
So these are the conditions where he can be made criminally liable.
Now coming to the last aspect of the directors as we know that directors powers are unlimited with regard to the corporate affairs to the company.
So they are to be exercised cautiously and mostly they are to be exercised by the board by the rule of majority.
And their depending upon the size of board, one third sell be the quorum where in the initial process of decision making will start because if a decision starts in a bad faith it will end up making the corporate bank corrupt are that may be a very region of termination of the existence of corporation.
So we see that there is a provision in section 173 which talks about what would be the structure and conduct and convening of the board meeting with says that a board has to meet within a year four times, first of all and within two meetings there will be a gap of 120 days.
And now the new act for the very first time applies and uses the electronic devices in electronic modes for holding meetings they are postal ballets and they are electronic mails.
So if we see this new structure of the company that gives a better access to the directors who can collectively decide that how the decisions in the best interest of the company shall be taken.
Lastly to conclude this module I would like to tell that directors are very important persons in the company and the directors are the like cabinet of the Lok Sabha.
So if they are on the most important pedestal of governor they have to be the best man who will be guarding the interest of all the stakeholders of the company.
Thank you.
Promoters, their positions, powers, duties and liabilities: While introducing this subject the promoters, I must deal with the basic aspects of the promotions of the company.
While promoting a company a person uses the company as a legal device for maximization of profit which is basically known as the business or trading activities.
So, promoters basically in a society are known as entrepreneurs who exercise in their fundamental right to do business; uses the corporate cover the corporate companies for maximization of profit.
The promotion is a very difficult task wherein the promoters while promoting the company travel through ranges of activities.
Therein, he incorporates the company, manages as the capital for the company, gives the necessary directions to the directors of the company.
In this module the learning outcome for you will be: who is a promoter, what is promotion, what are the duties of promoters, what are the liabilities of promoters, what is the remuneration of promoters and what is pre in cooperation agreement? Now, we should switch to the first issue that is the promoters and promotions.
As we know that promotion is a very technical and nontechnical task wherein the promoters are engaging certain associates are aids to help them out while promoting a company.
Promotion of company right from the joint stock companies act has been a very technical issue wherein the law recognize a certain individuals as an association of persons and then give them the corporate cover which they can exercise and use for maximization of profit.
This promotion has been up 3 types: Individual Promotion, Institutional Promotion and Professional Promotion.
In individual promotions the people who are very much jealous enthusiastic, they come together, they form a company and therein the company.
In the institutional promotions in order to pursue the objectives which are set by the people and the companies which are in public dealings.
So, there in the public companies can promote another company and third categories professional promotion where in the company is corporate or incorporate a company.
And those companies; the first business is incorporation Investments.
And mostly it is a west formula where the people give this assignment of promoting the company to the professional companies and we have certain companies, like: UBS, Merrill Lynch; who promote the company and the professional bases and for that there are fare charges.
Moving on, we will come to the stages of promotion what task a promoter is assigned to and how he moves on?So, this starts with the conception of idea because I told you that this is a modus operand die of doing business and because it's a device of doing business then if you plan it better that what kind of Corporate cover do you want, what kind of cooperation do you want for your particular type of services and goods?Then, half the task is all done.
So, its start with conception of idea, it moves to the next stage that is the most important states that is called incorporation and then next stage come, which is called flotation wherein the promoters manage the capital of the company and then the last stage comes which is called commencement of business.
Moving on, we will now try to define the term promoters.
I must make you clear that this last year in 2013 the New Company Act was passed by the Indian Parliament that is Companies Act, 2013.
In that for the first time we have tried to define the term promoters.
Otherwise, the term promoter was not defined in the old act and there was a proper definition that was given by house of lord in a judgment that is Whaley Bridge Company versus Green.
Wherein justice Bowell try to conclude the term by saying that promotion is an activity where there is a culminations are the confluence of two activities one is technical the other is non technical.
And in technical aspects he says arranging the knowhow, having a project planning, having a feasibility study; these are the technical aspects of promotions of the company.
And in non technical aspects of the company which is basically the incorporation of the company you have to have the required assemblies of the subscribers.
You have to get documented the documents of the company that is the memorandum and articles of the company and you may have to draft the prospectors if you are going for the initial public offer are the other types of private placement.
So essentially, if you see promotion; the promotion basically is founding a company so it's just like a father giving birth to a baby.
The next wonderful definition that we gets is the definition which is there in the security exchange in commission rule of US which is equally a very important definition to know wherein the rule defines the term promoter as a person who acting alone or in conjunction with other persons directly or indirectly takes the initiative in founding are organizing the business enterprise.
It also very much emphasizes the term founding are organizing the business enterprise.
So, doing anything for finding the company for maximization of profit leads to the conclusion that, that is the promoter.
Now, in the 2(69), 2 sub section 69 of the Indian companies act has define the term promoter because we have seen that the most of the companies now being used as a mode of scams or mode of what we call ‘ghotalas’ in Indian term.
So, in that there was a need there was a dire need to define the term promoters.
And because of that we have defined it in section 2 subsection 69 with basically is 3.
That any person whose name appears on the prospectors of the company are whose name appears in the annual return of the company is a promoter.
Then any person who controls the affairs of the company directly or indirectly then he is also a promoter of the company.
And last in accordance with whose device the directors are instructions of the board of directors of the companies custom to act and this does not include the professional people were engaged with the company, like: lawyer, the company secretary; they are not included.
So, if you see this definition the close analysis maybe that promoter is a person whose name appears in the official documents of the company and promoter is a person who has a full control over the affairs of the company.
Now, we will move to the activities which a promoters does while promoting the company.
So, if you see the activities of promoters it ranges from the so many activities, like: when he starts for having the idea of the company the most important things comes to the mind that he wants to do business by buying and selling and buying and selling goods and services.
So, he has to see what can be sold, first of all.
So, feasibility survey that what can be salable and what is in demand that is the first task that has to be done and then the second task is that how you can better sell that thing by which company because we know we have different types of companies.
Now, we have OPC One Person Company, we have a small company also, we have producers company, we have service company; we have so many companies.
So, depending upon what you want to sell is suitable type of corporate device can be picked and choosed.
So, that is the first thing which we know that conception of Idea and when you conceptualize an idea, conceive a baby that what kind of baby are what kind of company who want to have then the features and far those features you need to have so many things to be done in a while, like: you shall have to apply for so many numbers now, that is the CIN number (Corporate Identity Number) then GLN number (Global Location Number) TAN and PAN number as we know because they are subject to the tax realization.
Then, the next requirement is that you need to have the required number of subscribers because as we know that we need 2 or 7 subscribers for making public and private companies.
So, you have to have those required number of subscribers you have to have the numbers which are very much required by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs now.
And then, moving on you have to go for the next important aspect that is incorporation of company wherein you shall have to apply to the ROC with required documents and fees plus you have to have the documents of the company that is articles and memorandum.
They are the most important thing in the life of the company.
Then you have to have a very bulky document which is prospectus in the prospectus because by the prospectus you invite people to come and invest buy share in the company.
So, you have to have draft a prospectus also.
After that you have to have so many intermediaries: the Bankers, the Registrar the Depository Participant, the depositories the custodian and they will be involved in the process of share subscription which we know as flotation.
And therein the issuer, investors and intermediaries will arrange capital for the company.
And after that are within the process of that the promoters also will be doing so many waiting and compliance activities while drafting the prospectus are arranging the capital by way of IPO or private placement.
And in all these activities he is doing all such activities for the company which is non existence because as we know that company comes into an existence forth with after the getting certificate of incorporations.
So, so long the certificate of incorporation is not there, there is no birth of the company and for that for each thing that is to be done for founding and enterprise the promoter is responsible.
And for that he enters into an agreement that is known as pre incorporation active act.
And these pre incorporation agreement can be used by the promoters for getting everything the technical knowhow for the business, the employment for the workforce, getting a land for the business enterprise, getting a land for the headquarter of the business enterprise, getting a land for the manufacturing unit of the business enterprise, signing so many a number of agreements with the supplier, with the trader, with the warehouse keepers.
So, in all these you have to use the pre incorporation agreement.
Moving on, we will now try to find out what is the legal position of the promoters.
As we know that the Indian Companies Act, 2013 does not define the role actually are the promoters but promoters are in a very better positions in regard to the information and access to the material and confidential information about the information process of the company.
That's why sometimes they are known as agents and sometimes they are known as trustee.
But, in a very important case which was Erlanger versus New Sombrero Phosphate Company Limited, the Cairns Lord Justice defined that the promoters undoubtedly stand in a fiduciary capacity or fiduciary positions.
The term fiduciary has defined by different law lexicon means that where the people are having mutual trust and faith.
Duties of promoters: So, as I told you that, promoters have a fiduciary role to play in the company formation process and that specifically leaves two duties are that casts 2 duties on the promoters.
The first is: duty not to make secret profit, the second is: duty to disclose.
So, duty not to make secret profit, basically; is casted upon the promoters because the promotion may be a sentimental attachment or may be a matter of sentiment and promotion maybe also misused.
And we have seen so many cases where the corporate veil have been abused.
So, where the corporate veil is being abused by fraudulent people in order to wash off the properties are in order to dump their unproductive properties be tangible and intangible in the companies then they can make secret profit.
And where they are making secret profit without disclosing then they will be bound to return it bound to restore it with the company.
And I would like to share why this situation arises in the company formation process.
Because in company formation process, the promoters are in the positions who are knowing everything about formation.
And they also know what objective they want to achieve by making that company and this gives a very better understanding about the position, actual positions and the information regarding the pricing of the things.
And there they can make a attempt to dump their third rated products with the company on very high price.
And we have very fine example of cases like Gluckstein v Barnes where are the promoters tried to dump their products which was known as Olympia and tried to make 20,000 pound secret profit which was actually restored back to the company.
And then, there is a very fine case which I stated before also Erlanger versus New Sombrero Phosphate Company where the promoters tried to have make profit out of exhausted minds which actually coasted the 5,000 pound for 1 lakh 10 thousand pounds without disclosing to the company.
So, these examples these illustrations show how promoters having better access to the information and having a better position in the company regarding to the pre incorporation agreement can misuse their positions by making profit.
I must make it clear at this moment that making profit is not disallowed you can make profit, provided you disclose it to the company.
Then, the second duty out of the fiduciary capacity of the promoters that is duty to disclose interest in the transaction.
This duty again is based upon on the principle of natural justice that the persons who were dealing with the Corporate Affairs of the company they must be very much meticulous, very bonafide and they have to disclose everything about everything which they are knowing about any product.
So, if these duties are not performed by the promoters then the company can designed the contract and the company can also suit for recovery of profit.
But the companies shall have to prove that actually the promoter was in a position where he can have a better access and where he has actually misused his authority by not disclosing material fact to the company are by making a secret profit.
So, if he is making a secret profit then he shall have to restore it back.
And in order to check it out whether he has made any secret profit and the first AGM is dedicated just to investigate and examine why and what were the route of promotions and what kind of promotional activities have been initiated by the promoters while promoting the company and actually the promoters made any profit or not.
So, by these illustrations we can see that promoters are under a moral obligations to promote the company in the best effort or in the best suitable manner.
Moving on, we will be now dealing with a very small aspect of the duties that when this duty starts and when this duty terminates.
So, the duties start with the conception of idea.
The moment the people the entrepreneurs who want to do business by way of corporations for maximization of profit conceived the idea that we have to do business by the corporation this duty starts immediately.
And the duty basically does not terminate in a sense because so long the company will be running the promoters will like to have a better grip over the company because this is their baby and when they have promoted the companies they will like to have their control over the affairs of the company.
That's why they use the controlling shares which we now have EDVR(Equity With Differential Voting Rights)where they will have lesser amount of equity but that would give them a better control in the Corporate Affairs of the company.
So, actually speaking their duty never dies; their duty continuous.
But so far so duty regarding the promoters liability is concerned then the promoters duty terminates at the moment when the first directors are appointed and if no directors are appointed the same promoter become the deemed director of the company.
That's why if directors are appointed their duty terminates, if directors has not appointed their duty continues but in a different role as a director of the company.
Liabilities of the Promoters: As I told you that this year we have made this act very comprehensive where we have tried to pluck the loopholes which were earlier there in the old act.
That's why we find at so many place, mentioned the liabilities of promoters and those liabilities are civil as well as criminal.
And these are result of the recent scams that took place in the Corporate Affairs as we know these were Satyam, Enron like scandal.
And because of that we made the provisions of the Companies Act more comprehensive, more covering and more reaching in terms of un stipules promotions.
And we have two terms in the Companies Act which is very much pivotal that is ‘officer’ who is the officer of the company and ‘officer in default’.
And the officer in default is punished for every type of wrong decisions that is been taken for every type of wrong compliance of the corporate laws which is there in the Companies Act.
So, we know see that the term officer and officer in default is very comprehensive enough to cover the promoters.
So, if we see the liabilities of the promoters it is thought as I told you from the conception of the ideas to the incorporation then the flotation then it goes for the commencement of business and lastly if the companies is promoters continues to control their power or want to have a controlling power over the company it continues till the death of the company that is the winding up of the company.
Now, the Companies Act is a very pivotal in regard to making of the company, so if someone is furnishing wrong information thereby getting the company incorporated that is punishable in section 7 of the new act.
And there is liability of the promoters as an officer in default for making in misstatement in the prospectus and these liabilities civil well as criminal and promoters are also liable for inducing people for buying shares in a corporation.
And then promoters are equally liable for making periodic disclosures which are meant for bringing transparency and accountability of the corporations and they are the annual letter and the annual financial statement which is very important to be filed under section 92 of this act.
As I told you that the company is required to appoint First Director.
Usually, they are appointed by the articles of the company but if company fails to appoint them then the same promoters will become deemed directors.
So, here also the role changes but the liability doesn't, they will be liable in a different role.
Then, the promoters also play very pivotal role in the corporate combination process that is merger and acquisition and amalgamations and therein they can award the hostile takeover either buyback system or by some other system.
So, in a corporate combination process they also play a very controlling role because they have controlling shares in the company and those controlling shares can be offloaded or on loaded depending upon the situation they are in if they want to have it they can offload it, they do not want to have it they can buy more securities from the market that is buyback.
Moving on, the liability is also continued when they are in the process of winding up as we know that winding up of the company is termination of the death and therein if there is winding of continuous the promoters are not dispensed with the liabilities that is there.
They will be unreliable to corporate fully with the company liquidator; with the company bench if that is there which is monitoring the winding up process.
And now we have very comprehensive criminal as well as civil liabilities of the promoters if enduring winding up process there are misusing their authority and they are promoting the fraudulent activities then they shall be liable under section 336 to 342 of the New Companies Act.
As well as they will be also liable from section 447 to 453 of the act wherein they are made liable in a very comprehensive manner for all such fraudulent activities which turns out to be fraudulent after the winding up of the company.
And there is one very specific provision section 450 which is very comprehensive and which is of residuary nature.
You can further refer the Bare Act of the Companies Act for your inclusive growth.
I will now concentrate about the very important aspect of the promotion that is the prospectus.
As we know that the prospectus is offer document by which you make people aware that this is the company and there you can invest.
And in the prospective you see that company provides 3 basic information: One is the general information of the company; what the company is, what the company is doing, what the company is going to do?Then, there is financial information of the company: basically, it is a balance sheet or PLN account of the last three preceding financial years and then the issue information that what kind of IPU you want to bring an initial public offer and by that what is your target to achieve? What is your subscribed capital, what is your paid up capital what would be your paid up capital and by that paid up capital how you are going to realise your objectives?So, in the issue part you have to provide so many things, like: you have to provide the base price, you provide for the book building process, you have to provide for the QIBs, who will be the QIBs, who will be the institutional investors, will be the retail investors and who is your stock exchange, whether you are listed on are not listed so many things you have to provide.
But the basic important feature of the IPO of process is prospectus.
As we know that drafting a prospectus is very technical task that is assigned to the company and that is more than 500 pages document which is running so wherein you have to provide everything the general information, financial information and issue information so you take help from outside and the help is provided by the SEBI Security Exchange Board of India.
Because SEBI is the regulator of the capital market primary and secondary.
So, SEBI will be helping you out and therein first; we have to draft a prospectus and file with the SEBI.
After drafting the prospectus the SEBI will do the red pencil exercise that is known as Red Hearing Prospectus and finally there will be final publication of a draft after the final publication of the draught people will buy the shares of the company.
So, we see that the role of prospectus is very important in the share subscription because it helps the prospective investors of the company to make up a decision, rational decision, whether they should invest in a company or not and weather by disclosures made in the prospectus, the companies appear to be a company which is actually going to achieve certain objectives which are moral also not only the legal.
Because legally speaking the companies meant for maximization of profit but maximization of profit cannot be an objective of any society.
It is also associated with all other objects; like: text, like: employment, like: supply of necessities so one has to be closely seeing all these aspects also.
He can't ignore it.
Moving on, I am dealing with the prospectus; prospectus is very important and as I told you that for drafting a prospectus which is at meticulous, you may have to have civil and criminal liabilityAnd for that I would like to quote a case which can make you better understand the prospectus and miss statement the prospectus that is a very old case, William Derry versus Henery Peek, Derry versus peek we know it often.
And this case is about how miss statement in the prospectus is a very material one.
And in this case there was a company British Tramways Companies.
British Tramways Company applied for a license with the board of trade and this license was pending but the directors assuming that they in all probably cases will g et the license they made a disclosure in the prospectus that they have got the license from the Board of Trade and they will now run the British Tramways company instead of Horse Power with the Steam Power.
But actually, the situation was the day license application was pending with the Board of Trade.
So, actually they did not receive.
So, the information that was with them was not true but they believed to be true and they made it and uncertain grounds the House of Lord held it that this is a case of misrepresentation not fraud.
That's why the directors were not held accountable but this case is a very fine example upon which we drafted our Companies Act.
And therein we provided for civil as well as criminal liability of the promoters in case there is any misleading or miss statement in the prospectus.
So, in this regard I would like to say that while drafting the prospectus we observed the Golden Rule Formula and Golden Rule Formula is make 100% disclosure about the facts which are within the information of the promoters so as to make know the prospective investors of the company the best about the company.
Moving on, as we know that I was telling you that there are provisions in the Companies Act, New Companies Act in section 34 and 35 which is civil and criminal liability regarding the miss statement of prospectus but there are general and special defenses also available to the people who are associated with the prospectus.
If they have with due their consent they will not be held accountable.
If they are working in professional capacity they will not be held accountable.
If something is creeping in the prospectus without their information they will not be held accountable.
So, this is about the special aspect of liability with regard to the prospectus especially.
Pre-incorporation Agreement: The term Pre-Incorporation agreement as I suggested you is very important because these are the soul and heart of the company formation process.
As I told you that here the corporation that is contemplation in the eye of law that is a legal device that is the legal person is speaking so that is a corporation aggregate also.
So, in this corporation aggregate we find that certain individuals are given a corporate cover and they are held as a different individual are different personality that is a corporate personality and corporate personality is altogether different from the other members who are actually the subscribers on the company.
So, the actual position is that they are doing the thing for a company which is going to come in future.
So, whatever acts they are doing now that will be validated only when the company gets incorporated.
Meaning thereby whatever agreements they have to sign in order to mobilize resources for formation of the company that has to be done in some representative character wherein they are disclosing that whatever would material, whatever resources they are getting that would be utilised for the formation of the company.
Meaning thereby whatever agreement they are signed that should be signed an account of or on behalf of a company which is going to come in future.
So, this agreement which basically is very pivotal in company formation process is known as Pre-Incorporation Agreement but the legal issue with the Pre-Incorporation Agreement is that those agreements are signed by the company which is not in existence.
And those agreements will be nullity in the eye of law as explained in a case Kelner vs Baxter and that Kelner vs. Baxter case is a fine example about the crucial issue that was involved in the Pre-Incorporation agreement.
Wherein two people Kelner and Baxter, they incorporated company promoted a company Gravesend Royal Alexandra Hotel company and therein they one person one party tried to sell the wine to the other party.
The price was 900 pound and this was done by a sale agreement which was signed on January 27 1866 within company was not incorporated.
The directors, they would be directors of the company ratified the agreement on February first, 1866 even now the companies not incorporated.
Then, it was finally, the company finally received the certificate of incorporation on 20th February and subsequently also director signed a ratification agreement on 11th April.
So, we see that there is a sale happening of wine which will be used for business by the company which is going to come and sale the agreement is actually taking place much before the date of incorporation.
And date of incorporation is very important in this regard because after that only the legal existence of the company will come.
So, in the case the court held that until the companies incorporated it cannot contract and because it cannot contract then the effect of contract will be in nullity because the company was not there being an honest.
There was no existence of the company that’s why Pre-Incorporation Agreement will not be valid and all those things which are being mobilized the liability for that will be held.
A liability for that will be borne by the promoters.
So, because of this technical issue regarding the Pre-Incorporation Agreement there was a kind of repelling factor which stops the promoters promoting a company because they may be in a situation that company may with all those agreement subsequently to the incorporation process because as I told you in the first AGM the promoters are made accountable that whatever pre incorporation agreement they have signed that would be checked and verified.
That's why the Jenkins Committee in 1962 in England recommended for that we should have a provision for the protection of the promoters and therein by the recommendations of Jenkins committee.
There was an amendment made in the English Companies Act, 1985 under section 36 wherein the promoters were given a relief and the relief was that if the Pre-Incorporation Agreement is warranted by the terms of incorporations.
Then, the company cannot repudiate its liability the company cannot reject all those agreements and then in the line of that we are also a common law country we also had an amendment in our act and the amendment was made in the Indian Specific Relief Act, 1963 in the provision 15(h) and 19(e).
In both situations if there are Pre-Incorporation Agreements then in pre corporation agreements they can be made in foreseeable by company or against company if the activity which is the part or subject matter of the pre-incorporation active event is warranted by the terms of incorporation.
Warranted by the terms of incorporation is a very wide term that basically means that whatever thing, whatever services, whatever activities has been done in the name of Pre-Incorporation Agreement that is within the term of incorporation or not depends upon the situations.
Like, as I told you that if a company is being formed then promoters may have so many other opportunities but if those opportunities are being availed by the promoters for their vested interest then the company can obviously avoid it, holding it ultra vires; meaning thereby that was not warranted by the terms of incorporations.
Like, having a holiday while promoting a company when he is going to sign a technical, a technology transferred agreement with some other country can be a situation which will be not warranted by the terms of incorporations.
So these are the situations regarding the pre-incorporation agreement.
Remuneration of Promoter: As we know that Promoter stands in a fiduciary capacity where he is believed to have mutual trust and obligations and moral obligations for promoting the company.
So, naturally the promoters and not given any kind of remuneration for promoting a company.
And I told you that promoters basically give birth to a company and father does not charge anything from this baby that is the basic code that we have from the Robert R. Pennington’s book.
But we see that because the promotion is a very technical task it involves so many activities to be done that's why the promoters are required to be paid something which have some monetary value in eye of law.
So, promoters can be paid by fully paid up shares as was done in ‘Solomon Case’.
Promotion can also be given commission on shares sold.
Promoters can also be paid a lump-sum amount also and the articles of the company may also provide for the promotional remunerations.
Apart from that after the incorporation process there can be a separate covenant or there can be a separate agreement with the promoters for the payment of the remuneration.
So, while remunerating the promoters the company should also be mindful that promotion is not a very simple task and if the promoters are in anticipation or in apprehension the day shall be paid for their promotion.
They will not be ending up doing scams, they will not be ending up making secret profit they, will not be concealing very material information from the company.
So, remunerating the company is a very important thing while formation of the company.
And in this regard, I would like to say that if the company he is being sold property which actually of the promoter.
Then, the company can in lieu up that assign him the fully paid up shares which is the best mode of payment or boast made of remunerating the promoter.
Moving on, as we have seen that in the promotion activities that the promoters are very important persons in the Corporate Affairs of the company so they have a very better control over the management of the company and they keep this control throughout the life of the company and the promoters are also the persons who actually sink and swim with the corporate life.
I would like to close the module which I was talking with you on the promotions and I would like to say that promotion is very important activities wherein a promoter is involved in making a business enterprise which shall be used for maximization of profit.

Fourth, kind of routes available prohibited and permitted.
Fifth, would be what are the investment criteria for different entities when it comes to foreign direct investment in India.
The overview of the module will be that students will be able to understand the concept of Foreign Direct Investment in India.
They will understand the nuances of such investments methods and types.
They will also learn prohibited and permitted sectors as well as different criteria for different entities.
The policy of the government behind the investment will also be brought to knowledge for the purpose in this case.
The student will also learn about the Foreign Exchange Management Act.
In the light of the liberalisation policies introduced in 1991, the government at that point of time wanted to infuse a lot of foreign capital into the economy in order to promote the dying sectors of the economy.
So, what it wanted to do was open up the economy, liberalise economy and try to globalise the economy.
How to liberalize and globalize the economy by infusion of Foreign Direct Investment.
There existed an act called as Foreign Exchange Regulation Act and which was the regulating act on the foreign exchange in India.
So, during the process of economic liberalization related to foreign investment and foreign trade the government realised that FERA needs to be amended and to be brought in light with the present practices that the government wanted to introduce.
Also that it was felt that the time for FERA has you know ended and the new act should be introduced in order to incorporate the new world.
So, taking into consideration such development and a substantial increase in foreign exchange reserves, growth in foreign trade, rationalisation of tariffs, current account convertibility, the foreign exchange management bill to repeal the foreign exchange Regulation Act was introduced in Lok Sabha.
But unfortunately, at that point of time the Lok Sabha dissolved and the bill could not be passed.
So, the foreign exchange management act then was later introduced in Lok Sabha.
The president give assent on 9 December, 1999 and was brought into force from 1 June 2000.
Now, the foreign companies invest in India to take advantage of relatively low wages, special investment privileges such as tax exemption etc.
For a country where for investors invest, it means that they are giving technical know how to the country and as well as their generating employment.
Now, they are becomes important elements as to when we understand foreign exchange and foreign investment.
There are two transactions that we really need to learn.
The current account transaction as well as a capital account transaction.
The current account transaction is under Section 5 of the FEMA where it says that any person to sell or drop foreign exchange to or from authorized person is such sale of withdrawal is the current account transaction as defined under section 2J of the act.
However, the central government may in public interest and consultation with the Reserve Bank impose reasonable restrictions for current accounts transaction.
So, what are the some examples that we can stipulate is for opening of letter of credit, use of international credit card, International debit card or ATM card or any other thing where the effect of creating for an exchange liability happens.
Now, the second concept is Capital Account Transaction.
Capital Account Transaction is mentioned under section 6 of the FEMA or the Foreign Exchange Management Act whereby it allows for exchange or for creation of foreign foreign currency where by the Reserve Bank of India is to specify consultation with the central government any class or classes of Capital Account Transaction permissible and the limit up to which foreign exchange shall be admissible for such transaction.
However, Reserve Bank shall not impose any restriction on the drawl of foreign money.

So, why we were discussing what is Foreign Exchange Management Act? Now, it also becomes very imperative on us to understand what are the various authorities that control Foreign Exchange Management Act? For the purpose of this act there are two authorities that control the foreign exchange in India.
First is the central government second is the RBI.
Further bifurcation can be made under central government in the form of Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion that is DIPP and second will be Foreign Investment Promotion Board FIPB.
And under RBI, there is a Foreign Exchange Department which regulates the entire gamut of what the RBI role should be.

All options comes with NRIs or PIOs for the purpose of investment in a firm or proprietorship except real estate, print media, immovable property and agricultural and plantation business that exist in India.
Now, let us understand the Foreign Currency Account.
In Indian companies which are eligible to issue shares to persons resident outside India under the FDI policy may be allowed to retain the share separation about in foreign currency account with prior approval of RBI.
Now, how to transfer of shares and convertible debentures? First, subject to FDI sectoral policy.

Third, escrow account.
AD category one banks have been given general permission to open escrow account and special account of non- resident corporate for open offers or existing offers and delisting of shares.

Prior permission of RBI in certain cases for transfer of capital instruments.
The following instances of transfer of capital instrument from resident to non-resident by way of sale require prior approval of RBI.
First, transfer of capital instruments from resident to non-resident by way of sale where the transfer is at a price which was falls outside the pricing guidelines specified by the Reserve Bank from time to time at the transaction does not fall under the specific guidelines of as specific exception.

So that RBI can process it and as well as then look into the matter.

Now, what are when we study the foreign exchange we also need to study the foreign the conversion of external commercial borrowings or the lump sum fee or the royalty into equity.
Conversion of ECBs or royalty into equity.
Following factors need to be considered while conversion of the external commercial borrowing takes place.
Which are that Indian companies have been granted general permission for conversion of external conversion borrowing in inconvertible foreign currency into shares and preference shares subject to the following condition and requirements.
First would be the activity of the company is covered under the automatic route for the FDI other company has obtained government approval for foreign equity.
Second, the foreign equity after conversion of ECB into equity is within the sectoral limit.
Third, pricing of shares is as per FDI policy.
Fourth, complainance with the essential as prescribed under any other law statued, en force.
Fifth would be, the conversion facility available for such ECBs which can be availed under both the routes and is applicable to ECBs due for payment or not.
As well as secured or unsecured loan available for non-resident collaborators.
Now, let us also understand several instruments that are available with us when it comes to issue to the foreign investors.
First, would be issue of write or bonus shares.
The right of bonus share is covered under FEMA as it allows Indian companines to freely issue it to the existing non-resident share holders subject to observance of sectoral cap as well as the as such as companies act or this SEBI ICDR guidelines 2,000.
The price priority needs to be maintained at all levels so that there exists no problem with approval.
Second, prior permission of RBI for right issue to erstwhile OCBs.
Automatic existence or entertainment of right has been discontinued post September 16, 2003.
Therefore, companies which desired to issue such write to erstwhile OCBs will have to take permission from RBI now.
Now, third will be acquisition of shares under scheme of merger, demerger or amalgamation.
Merger, Demerger and amalgamation of companies in India are administered by an order issued by the court.
Whereby a scheme is presented before the court and the scene is approved by the court in order that a merger of the transferee company of the new company is allowed to issue shares to the shareholders of the transferor company resident outside India, subject to two conditions.
First is, the percentage of share holding patterns of person resident outside India in the new company does not exceed the sectoral cap.
Second would be the new companies not engaged in any activities as prohibited under the FDI policy.
Now, the next category of instrument would be issue of shares under the employee stock option Schemes or commonly known as ESOPs schemes.
ESOP schemes the listed companies are permitted to issue shares under the ESOP schemes to its employee or employees of a joint venture or wholly owned subsidiaries abroad who are resident outside India other than to the citizens of Pakistan and of Bangladesh.
ESOPs can be issued with the prior approval of foreign investment promotion board or FIBB.
And shares can under ESOPs be also issue directly through a trust or fulfillment of the condition such as (A) Compliance of relevant regulation.
Second, the face value of the share the allotted under the scheme should not exceed 5% of the total paid up capital.
Third would be that a mandatory notice of 30 days needs to be given.
Where a person committing a contravention of any provision of this act may also of any rule may committed, was in charge and was in responsible to the company for the conduct the business of the company.
As well as the company shall be deemed to be guilty of the contravention and shall be liable to be preceded again punished accordingly.
There are certain section 13 clause 2 also further provides that any adjudicating authority adjudging any contravention may if he think fits, in addition to any penalty which he may impose of such contravention direct that any currency, security or any money or property in respect to which the contribution has been taken place shall me confiscated by the central government.
Now, there are certain prohibited sectors when it comes to foreign exchange.
There are as listed below.
First is, Atomic Energy.
Second is, Real Estate Business.
Third is, Plantation and Agriculture Business.
Fourth is, Lottery Business.
Fifth is, Nidhi company.
Sixth is, Trading in Transferable Development Rights .
And sixth is Gambling and Betting including casino and also area such as the the not open to Private Sector Investment.
And the last would be the print media.
Modes of entry in India.
So, the first one we were discussing was Wholly Owned Subsidiaries.
The wholly owned subsidiary arises when the parent company owns the subsidiaries entire shares that is the 100% shares.
Since the parent company owns all of the subsidiary shares, it has the right to appoint the Subsidiaries Board of Director which controls the subsidiary.
Wholly Owned Subsidiaries may be part of the same industry as well as of an entirely different industry.
A person operating in more than any one country may choose to operate a business to a Wholly Owned Subsidiaries.
They investment is subject to compliant of FDI policy.
Second will be subsidiary.
A foreign company can open a subsidiary company in India that can be done either by accruing the majority of the shares, that is more than 50% of the company or where controlling the composition of Board of Directors of the company.
Both holding and subsidiary companies, a separate legal entities and their related to each other by virtue of subsidiary and holding company relationship.
They are also subject to FDI policy.
Third is the joint venture.
A foreign company can enter into India by forming a strategic alliance with an Indian partner.
In general practice, it is defined as a business agreement in which the parties agree to develop for a finite time a new entity and a new asset in which they both are equally contributing equity.
The ratio of foreign party in shareholding can be anywhere between 0 to 50%.
By mutual agreement, they may exercise control over the enterprise and consequently share revenues, expenses, asset and liabilities may be divided.
It can be incorporated either as private limited company or a public limited company which has to be registered under the Companies Act, 2013.
And subject to exchange control regulation and foreign direct policy of the Government of India.
The investments are subject to the complaints of FDI policy.
Now, when we came to the definition of place of business under the Companies Act with the permission of RBI, there are three methods by which we can say what are the places of the business.
The first will be branch office.
Second will be the liaison or the representative office.
And the third can be project office.
The first that is branch office can be essentially anywhere, where the related activity is carried out by its head office and the purpose of such offices is essentially is expansion of business and to diverse location.
Thus, help in increasing the customer base.
Second will be the liaison or the representative office.
Foreign companies can also a setup a liaison or representative office whereby the role is only subject to collecting of information about market opportunities and providing production information about the parent company to future customers.
Third, as I discussed is project office which it means a place of business to represent the interest of the foreign company executing a project in India but does not include a liaison office.
Foreign companies can be set up temporary project and site offices for executing the specific projects.
The RBI has granted permission to a foreign entity for setting up project office in India.
Now, other important material changes that are brought under the Companies Act, 2013 when it comes to foreign investment in Indian companies.
The first would be foreign companies can now establish either a private or public limited company in India without any mandatory limitation under section 47 of the Companies Act, 1956.
Mandatory requirement of minimum one resident director who has to stay beyond a period of 180 days also has been reduced.
The new addition of video conferencing keeping in mind the recent developments that have been taking place is allowed subject to that a directory must attend a meeting within a period of 12 months.
The director responsibility statement in board shall disclose that their device proper system to ensure due compliance with the provisions of all applicable laws under the act.
The cross border merger has been allowed as per the provisions of Companies Act, 2013 subject to certain condition.
Also, the new companies act introduced the policy of class actions suit whereby the class action as constituted can be can bring a suit before the company law tribunal for the purpose of adjudication.
The dormant company concept has also been introduced in India.
Now, let us discuss this new amendments that have been brought by the FDI policy, 2015 as well as the FDI policy 2016.
The FDI policy has brought the following changes.
First, Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs in order for it to consider a proposal the pecuniary limit has been increased.
Second, prior approval in respect for any transfer of shares and mergers can be done away with the mandatory filing of FC-TRS for the transaction on stock exchanges.
Fourth will be prior approval is required if any additional foreign investment is required to be done.
The changes that have been brought by FDI policy 2016 is in light of doing ease of business in India.
There have been several changes that has been introduced in order to open the new sectors which were closed before and also to increase the existing sectoral caps where they were in limitation.
The government has taken steps in order to open and expand new sectors for the purpose under the FDI policy 2016.
I will now list out several important points under the new FDI policy 2016.
First is, 49% FDI under automatic route is permitted now in insurance and pension sectors.
The second is foreign investment upto 49% in defence sector is permitted under automatic route.
Third will be the FDI limit for defence sector mid applicable to manufacturing of small arms and ammunition covered under manufacturing arms, 1959.
The FDI, up to 100% under automatic route is permitted in teleport direct to home cable networks mobile TV head headed in the sky broadcasting services also.
100% FDI under automatic route is also available for the Brown Field airport projects.
Next, FDI limit for Scheduled Air Transport Service, Domestic Schedule Passenger Airline and Regional Air Transport Service is raised to 100% with FDI upto 49% permitted under automatic route and FDI beyond 49% through government approval.
Foreign airlines would continue to be allowed to invest in capital of Indian companies operating scheduled and non scheduled air transport services up to the limit of 49% of the paid up capital.
Next, in order to provide clarity to the e-commerce sector, the government has issued guidelines for foreign investment in the sector.
100% FDI under automatic route is permitted under the market model place of e-commerce.
100% FDI is also a proof of retail trading as well as through e- commerce and other such activities.
Also for all those who look into financial institution, 100% FDI is also allowed in ARC or also called as asset reconstruction companies under the automatic route.
Now, coming to certain market statistics that will make us understand the government figures and facts regarding how FDI is being increase in 2015 and 2016.
We have already taken China.
When it comes to foreign direct investment in India.
In 2015 India has the most amount of foreign investors when it comes to the global economy.
Certain as a fact was that the according to DIPP that is Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion, the total FDI in India in 2015-16 period was US dollar 40 billion which indicates that the government effort to increase the ease of doing business is totally working.
Since, the foreign investors are now encourage to invest in India further on.
The second will be that the highest FDI equity flow of US 6.9 billion dollars was also followed by the computer hardware sector and the software sector in India.
Third would be, India received the maximum FDI equity flows from Singapore and by Mauritius.
Then followed by USA and Netherlands and Japan .
So clearly, the Prime Minister's effort to increase the ease of doing business and to increase the inflow of foreign exchange in India is clearly working.
The next will be India witness 29% of increase in foreign foreign direct investment in India which reached to 40 billion dollars during April, 2015 and March, 2016 as compared to 30 million dollars last year.
The next is, the budget 2016 has proposed several reforms in FDI policies in areas of insurance and pension, asset reconstruction company, stock exchanges and for easier fund raising norm in order that clarification of tax has also been issued by the government so that there is more ease of doing business and the FDI can come easily.
Next is that in order to make India more attractive foreign investment destination.
The Finance Minister this year has also included something called as the resident permit policy whereby he is allowing the people to stay and to invest a further of USA 2 billion dollar to upscale the amount of inflow in the housing as well as the residency permit.
The Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP) has allowed 100 % FDI in Asset Reconstruction Company from this year on worth under the automatic route.
The next would be the government has relaxed FDI policy in 15 Sectors and as well as increase the sectoral caps in so many sectors benefiting so many people in employment know how facilities and as well as the technical know how.
The government also relax the FDI policy norms non-resident Indians.
Under this, the non repritable investment made by the PIOs, overseas citizens of India and NRIs will be treated as domestic investment and will not be treated as FDI caps.
India cabinet also cleared a proposal which allows 100% FDI in railway infrastructure excluding operation.
Though the initiative does not allow foreign firms to operate trains, it allows them to invest in areas such as creating the network and supplying trains for Bullet Trains.
India is also likely to grant most favored Nation to 15 member Nation that rather in talk regarding the agreement on RCEP that is Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership and would allows significant easing of investment rules for these countries.
In conclusion, FDI after 1991 has constantly increased and several factors and several areas have open and will keep on opening.
FDI is very important for any country to broom and prosper as we have seen in the case of China.
Friends ,I really wish you luck for the self assessment and examination.
All the best!
What exactly do mean with by business? Business and organisation or enterprise which is engaged in commercial industrial or professional activities.
A business can be for a profit entity.
Such as publicly treated corporations or for non profit organisations engaged in business activities such as agricultural cooperative.
L.R.DICKSON has defined business as a form of activity pursued primary with the object of earning profit for the benefit of those on whose behalf the activity is conducted.
Business involves production or exchange of goods and services to on profit or in a border sense to earn a living.
Profit is not the sole objective of the business.
It may have other objective like promotion of welfare of the workers and the general public.
Now, will discuss about the nature of business.
A business enterprise has the following characteristics.
First dealing in goods and services.
The first basic characteristics of a business is that it deals in goods and services.
Goods produced or exchange maybe consumer goods.
Such as bread, rice clothes etc. or capital goods such as machines, tools etc.
The second nature of business is production and exchange.
Every business is concerned with production and exchange of goods and services for value.
Thus, goods produced or purchased for personal consumption of presenting to others as gifts do not constitute business because there is no sale or transfer for value involved.
Third is regularity and continuity in dealings.
1 single cell transaction cannot strictly constitute a business.
A sale of a product can be called a business if it undertaken frequently.
Fourth is uncertainty or risk.
It is true that the element of risk is present in almost all economic activities.
But it is undoubtedly more significantly present in business activities.
Last is profit motive.
First production function.
What do we mean by production function ? Under this function, a business organisation transform its inputs like manpower, material, machinery ,capital, information ,energy into a particular output as demanded by the society.
The second function of business is marketing function.
This is concerned with the distribution of goods and services produced by the production department.
As we all know that in order to make a business successful how important is marketing.
The marketing department guides the production department in product planning, development in price of various products produced by the business is an it also promotes the sale of goods through advertisements and sales promotion.
Third is finance function.
Money is an important factor in any business.
Thus arrangements of sufficient capital for the smooth running of the business is an important function for a business organisation.
To undertake many important decisions such a source of finance, investment of funds in the productive ventures in levels of inventory for various items are undertaken under this finance function.
will discuss about the different forms of business organisation.
The first form of business organisation is sole proprietorship.
Business which runs under the exclusive ownership and control of an individual is called the sole proprietorship or single entrepreneurship.
Under this form and individual may run the business alone with the help of his own skill and intelligence or may employ a few employees for helping him in conducting the business.
It is the simplest and the oldest form of business organisation .
some of the features of sole proprietorship.
First, this is owned by 1 man who contributes capital for conducting business.
Secondly, he has absolute control over the affairs of the business.
Third, the liability of the sole proprietor is unlimited as he earns all profit.
Fourthly, a sole proprietary concern is free from government regulations.
No formalities are to be observed in its formation management or in its closure.
It is not a separate entity.
Consequently, the business comes to an end with the permanent disability that or insolvency of the proprietor .
some of the merits of sole proprietorship.
First, no legal formalities are required to complied with in order to start a sole proprietary business.
It is one of the most easy form of business organisation to start with and it is easy to form as well as to dissolve.
Second business secrecy is maintained .
And to face the challenge of the competition in the market maintenance of business secrecy provides an edge to the form over its rival firms.
Thirdly, sole proprietorship offers the scope for flexibility in business operations by alloing the business to adapt.
And it was itself to the changing times and situations.
Fourthly, as the size of a sole proprietorship business is small and the owner maintains a personal touch with the employes and customers, it brings inefficiency and motivation.
Then the government interference in the business activities.
And this form of business organisation is leased and the day to day running of the business.
Also there is no interference by the government.
some of the demerits of the sole proprietorship.
First ,large units which require enormous capital cannot be started find individual as he can contribute only a limited amount of capital in the business.
Secondly, as the liability of the sole trader being unlimited, even his private assets are in danger of being lost .
And in order to meet liabilities office business, there is an uncertainty of continuity.
Lastly, it's very difficult to lock maximum advantage under this form of business organisation.
As the financial resources are very limited.
The second form of business organisation is Hindu Undivided Family.
The joint Hindu family is a form of business organisation in which the family possesses a property, inherited property and the 'kartha' the head of the family manages its affairs.
It comes into existence by the operation of Hindu law and not out of contract between the members of coparceners As a result the joint Hindu family business is a business by a coparceners of a Hindu undivided estate.
Some of the features of Hindu undivided family are.
First, membership of a family business is the result of status arising from birth in the family and hence there is no question of members been discriminated in terms of minority and majority on the basis of age.
The death or insolvency of a coparceners or even that of the kartha does not affect the membership of Hindu undivided family.
some of the merits of Hindu undivided family.
Irrespective of the contribution made, every coparcener in the successful running of the business gets an equal share of profit.
Secondly, as different generations of family works in the same business the younger generation gets an advantage and help to develop and acquire expertise without much difficulty.
It serves as an insurance cover for maintaining the children, widows, ailing or invalid members of the family.
some of the demerits of Hindu undivided family.
As all the coparceners and equal right to share the profit made out of the joint business ,there is no encouragement to work hard and to earn more.
And it makes the members of the family very unenterprising.
Secondly, it has been seen that some times the 'Karta' of the family , his freedom for his own personal benefits and gains.
Thirdly, there is a fear of disintegration under this form of business organisation.
the third form of business organisation is partnership firm .
Section 4 of the Indian Partnership Act, 1932 define partnership as the relation between persons who have agreed to share the profits of a business carried on by all or any of them acting for all.
Persons entering into partnership agreement are known as partners and collectively as firm, partnership firm.
The name with which the business is started is known as "FIRM NAME".
some of the features of partnership firm.
At least 2 persons are needed to form a partnership firm.
The Partnership Act, fixes no limit on the number of partners to form a partnership firm.
Whereas the Companies Act limits on the number of the partners.
And its fixes some limit.
It lays down that any partnership or association of more than 10 persons, in case of banking business and 20 in other business operations.
Whereas according to the Companies Act, 2013 the maximum number of persons in any association or partnership may be up to such number as may be prescribed by not exceeding 100.
This restriction will not applied to any association of partnership constituted by professionals like lawyers ,Chartered Accountants ,company secretaries etc.
Who are governed by their special laws.
Under the Companies Act 1956 there was a limit of maximum 20% partners and there was no exemption granted to the professionals.
Under this form of business organisation ,agreement form the basis of a relationship And not the status as in the case of Hindu joint family.
There must be an agreement between 2 or more person to enter into a partnership.
Simply holding a property in joint ownership cannot be considered as partnership.
It should be accompanied by certain business activities And the partners must agree to carry some lawful business.
There must be an agreement to share the profit and losses of the business of the partnership firm.
However sharing of profits is not conclusive proof of partnership.
Fundamental test to test the existence of partnership firm is that there must be an agency relationship between the partners.
some of the merits of partnership firm first this form of business organisation like sole proprietorship is also relatively free from legal formalities.
In terms of its formation registration of partnership firm is not mandatory under the Partnership Act ,1932.
There is a flexibility in the functioning of the day to day business of the firm .
As partnership business is not regulated by any law in its day to day businesses .
Just as a company business is regulated by the company law.
A partnership firm is able to make decisions without delay because partners can meet and discuss the business problems more frequently.
Since the liability of the partners is unlimited, they are more cautious in the running of the business.
No major amendments can be made effecting the basic nature of the partnership without the unanimous consent of all the partners.
Thus every partners view voice carry weight in partnership firm.
some of the demerits of the partnership firm.
First, there is insecurity with the business after the death, retirement or insolvency of a partner.
Secondly, it fails to inspire public confidence.
As a partnership business is not subjected to detailed regulations just as company business.
Thirdly, a partnership is even words than sole proprietorship.
It makes investment in the partnership business reluctantly difficult.
the fourth forms of business Organisation is company.
A company is an incorporated voluntary association of person in business having joint capital divided into transferable shares of a fixed value.
Along with the features of limited liability common seal and perpetual succession.
it may be a public, private, foreign small associate holding and subsidiary company.
Companies may be incorporated with limited liability of its members of with unlimited liability.
Liability of members maybe limited by share or by guarantee.
some of the features of the company .
First, a company is an artificial person created by law to achieve the objectives for which it is formed.
A company exist only in the concentration of law.
It is an artificial person as we have already discussed earlier in the sense.
And sense that it is created by a process other than natural birth and doesn't process the physical attributes of a natural person.
This form of business organisation, as a continuous existence and its life is not affected by the death, lunacy, insolvency , retirement of its members.
Member may come and go.
However the company continues its operation so long as it fulfill the requirements of the law under which it has been formed.
sum of the merits of the company.
First by issuing shares and debentures to the public. A public company can raise large amount of money.
Secondly ,under this form of business organisation shareholders have limited liability of shares as they hold in the company.
And their private property is not attached pull to recover the dues of the company.
Thirdly ,this form of business organisation has a continuous existence and its light is not affected by the death, lunacy insolvency or retirement of its members.
Members may come and go.
However the company continues its operation so long as it fulfills the requirement of the law under which it is formed.
Fourthly, transferability of shares.
Shares of a public company are freely transferable.
There as the restrictions are place in case of transfer of shares and case of private companies.
some of the demerits of the company.
First, largest number of legal formalities has to be fulfilled by this form of a company for which provisions of Companies Act are to be complied with.
There is a divorce between ownership and management of the company.
Under this form of business organisation, it has been seen that though every shareholder has the right to participate in the Annual General Meeting.
But in practice ,companies are managed by a small Number of persons who are able to perfect with that power over the company from year to year.
the fifth form of business organisation is cooperative society.
A Cooperative organisation is established principally with a view to rendering service to its members.
In a particular to the society in and in general also.
Yet this does not mean that such an organisation will not work for profit.
The capital of the Cooperative organisation is collected from its members in the form of share capital.
But as we know this constitutes only unlimited source of Business Finance.
As a result major part of capital is raised either by way of loan from the government or by way of grants from the government.
third is separate legal entity.
Fourthly, the management of a Cooperative organisation vest in managing the committee elected by member.
It is the General Body of the members which lays down the brode framework of policy within which the Managing committee has to function.
Some of the merits of the Cooperative Society .
First, it is easy to form a cooperative society as it is voluntary Association which does not required long and complicated legal premunirise.
As lays down by the law.
Any 10 adult persons can voluntary form themselves into an association and get it registered with the registrar of cooperative.
Secondly, the management of a Cooperative organisation invest in a managing committee elected by the members only.
And it is the General Body of the members which lays down the broad framework of policy within which the managing committee has to function.
Thirdly, members in a cooperative organisation have limited liability in contributing the capital shares as shareholders have in a company.
Fourthly, similar to the company the Cooperative also enjoy a separate legal entity of its own. Independent of the entity of its members who own it.
That's why the life of a cooperative organisation remains unaffected by the death insolvency of a member.
some of the demerits of a Cooperative Society.
First, the amount of capital that a cooperative can collect is very limited as of the member ship remains confined to a particular locality or region .
And also because the principle of one man one vote.
Secondly, in the day to day functioning of cooperative state government subject them to a variety of regulations which leads to the interference and slow growth.
Thirdly ,lack of secrecy is seen in the form of business organisation.
will discuss about corporate personality.
What do we mean by corporate personality? Corporate Personality is a creation of law.
Both English and Indian law recognise legal personality of a corporation.
A Corporation has a legal personality of its own and it can sue and can be sued in its own name.
It does not come to end with the death of its individual members and therefore has a perpetual existence.
However unlike natural persons a corporation can only act through its agents.
Besides corporation ,the banks ,railways, universities, colleges, church, temple, hospital etc. are also conferred legal personality.
Union of India states are also recognised as legal or juridic person.
Corporations are of 2 types .
First Corporation aggregate.
What do we mean by Corporation aggregate? This is an association of human beings united for the purpose of providing that certain interest.
A limited company is one of the best examples of Corporate etiquette.
This kind of cooperation is formed by the members who are in agreement to contribute to the capital of the company in furtherance of a common object.
Thus their liability is limited to the extent, the share holding in the company .
This principle of Corporate personality was recognised in the case of Salman vs Solomon and Company.
The Second form of cooperation is cooperation soul.
This kind of cooperation is stated by a single person who is personified and regarded by law as a legal person .
The single person exercises of some of his functions deals in legal capacity and has legal rights and duties towards the same.
The object of a corporation soul is similar to that of Corporation aggregate.
some of the advantages of incorporation.
First, independent corporate existence.
A corprated company has an independent corporate existence.
This means it has distinct legal personality independent of its members.
Secondly, limited liability one of the principal advantages of an incorporated company is the privilege of limited liability.
This is the main feature of registered companies which attract investors.
Thirdly, perpetual succession.
An incorporated company has continued succession that means the company shall remain it's a state and prove possession as the same entity with the same privileges and immune not with standing any change its members.
Corporate existence of a company is not affected by the death or insolvency of its members .
The death or insolvency of individual members does not a in any way affect its corporate existence.
Fourth ,Transferability of shares .
Section 82 of the Companies Act, 1956 specifically provides that the shares or other interest of any members in a company shall be movable property transferable in the manner provided by the articles of association of the company.
Thus the member of an incorporated company can dispose of his share by selling them in the open market and get back the mouse in the state.
The transferability of shares has 2 main advantages.
Firstly, it provide liquidity to the investors at the same time ensure stability to the company.
Similar position regarding the transbility of share supplies in the company and 2013.
fifth advantage of incorporation is separate property.
In corporation helps the property of the company to the clearly distinguished from that of its members.
Lastly ,the capacity to sue and be sued.
A company being a body corporate can sue and can be sued in its own name .
A criminal complaint can be filed by a company by the company has to be presented by a natural person.
some of the disadvantages of Incorporation.
Far more compliance and regulations need to deal with and there is an increasing risk of penalties.
Second, a company is more complicated and costly to wind up.
Directors a person is subject to regulations and can be find a found guilty of a criminal offence for failing to comply.
Director shall be held personally liable if he or she acts beyond the provisions of the company act .
Memorandum and articles of association has been ultrawide the company or the directors.
what are the learning outcomes by the end of this module? And having completed the essential readings an activity students would be able to categorise the common form of business organisations and their main features.
Then they shall be able to delineate the legal distinction between incorporated an unincorporated association.
Lastly the shall also be able to understand corporate personality and advantages and disadvantages of the same.
we will talk about one person company in other jurisdictions.
Can I introduce to one person company in 2005 in which the promoting individual is both the director and shareholder.
Only one person is allowed to apply for opening a limited company with the minimum capital of 100000 .
The Mendel law of China allows the owner to pay the investment capital at one time which bars him from opening a second company of the same kind.
Where as an Pakistan the amended law permits one person to form a single member company by filing with the registrar at the time of incorporation.
Where nomination in the prescribed form indicating at least 2 individuals to act as nominee director and alternate director.
In Singapore Company Amendment Act, 2004 deals with it.
Where as an United States seven state permits the formation and operation of single member limited liability company.
In most of the countries the law governing companies enable is single member company to have more than one director.
And grant exemptions to such companies from holding AGMS though records and documents are to be maintained.
Today's topic of discussion is objects, powers of the companies and their internal administration.
As discussed in earlier module that for incorporation for a registration of a company 2 important document are require to be prepare and filed with the registrar of the companies.
And these 2 documents are Memorandum of Association and Articles of Association.
As observed by pamam these are the document of great important in relation to the proposed company.
The memorandum of association and articles of association are now known as memorandum and articles in the present act of 2013.
These document are consider to be very important.
As they contain some fundamental clauses which describe condition of a companies incorporation.
It also discusses the alteration that can be done in memorandum and articles of association and the effects of such alterations.
The learning objectives of the module are.
First, to explain the different clauses or contain Memorandum and Articles of Association.
To discuss the procedure for alteration of Memorandum and Articles of Association of a company.
And lastly to discuss the importance of Memorandum and Articles of a company they hold, information of any company.
We will begin with memorandum of Association definition .
Memorandum of association of a company as originally framed or as altered from time to time is pursuance of any previous companies law.
Or of this act is laid down in section 2 subsection 28.
Memorandum of association enables a party dealing with the company to know with certainty as whether the contractual relationship to which they intend to enter with the company is within the objects of the company.
It is the main document of a company which defines its object .
And lays down the fundamental conditions upon which alone the company is allowed to be formed.
It governs the relationship of the company with the outside world and define the scope of it activities.
Memorandum of association enable’s a party dealing with the company to know with certainty as whether the contractual relation to which they intent to enter with the company is within the objects of the company or not.
In Ashbury Railway Carriage And Iron Company Limited vs Riche ,an Egyptian salt and soda Company Limited case .
It was held that memorandum of association of a company is the main charter of a company.
And it defines the limitation on the powers of a company.
And its states negatively that nothing shall be done be on the Ambit which a memorandum of a company prescribes.
What is the purpose of memorandum of association? The purpose of memorandum of association is to enable the shareholders, creditors and those who deal with the company to know what is permitted in the range of enterprise.
Now we will discuss about the contents of memorandum.
The first content of a memorandum is Name Clause.
The first clause of the memorandum has to state the name of a proposed company.
As company begin a legal person should have a name.
Because name of a corporation is a somber of its existence.
There are certain things which should be kept in mind while deciding on a company's name.
Like, no company can be registered with the name which in the opinion of the central government is undesirable.
And it should not be identical with the name of another registered company.
Secondaly ,whatever be the name of the company, if the liability of the members is limited the last word of the name of the company should contain limited.
And in the case of a private company, it should contain private limited.
If a company desire's to change its name then it can be done by passing a special resolution.
And with the approval of the central government specified in writing.
This section four subsection 1(A) of the Companies Act 2013 which corresponds to Section 13 1(A) of the Companies Act 1956 talks about the name clause.
Now the second clause of the memorandum is Registered Office.
The second clause of a memorandum must specify the state in which the registered office of the company is to be situated.
This should be done within 30 days of incorporation or commencement of business whichever is earlier.
And if a company desires to shift its registered office from one place to another within the same city ,town or village ,they can do it without passing a special resolution.
But if they want to shift it from one City to a different city all together then a special resolution has to be passed.
Section 12 subsection 15 states that no company shall change the place of its registered office from the jurisdiction of 1 registrar to the jurisdiction of another registrar within the same state.
Under such change are confirmed by the Regional Director on an application made by the company regarding the same in the prescribed manner.
Section 12 of the Companies Act 2013 lays down the provisions regarding registered office of a company.
It states that on inform 15th day of the incorporation of a company.
Now, the third clause is Object and Clause.
The third and the most important clause of memorandum must state the objects for which a company is proposed to be established.
It is essential that the public who subscribes for its shares should know clearly what the objects of the company are? In the case of a companies which are in existence immediately before the commencement of the Companies Amendment Act ,1965.
The object clause had simply to state the object of the company.
But in the case of a company to be registered after the amendment.
The object clause was required to state separately the main object, the other objects and states to which other objects extend.
What do we mean by main objects? Under this clause the company had to state their main objects.
And objects incidental to the attainment of this main object.
Secondly, other objects.
Under this, the other objects had to be stated by the company which is not included in the above option.
Third was stage to which object extended.
Under this, the companies whose objects were not confined to1 state , this clause had to mention the state whose territories the object extended.
Under the Companies Act 2013 Section 4 subsection 1(c) states the object of the clause of memorandum.
Which says that it does not contain categories of main objects and the other objects like it was contained in 1956 act.
It only specifies then the memorandum of a company should specify the objects for which a company is proposed to be incorporated .
And any matter considered necessary in furtherance there off.
Now the next clause is Capital Clause.
The last clause states that the amount of a nominal capital of the company and the number and the value of the shares into which it is divided.
Section 3 of the act prescribe the requirement that a public company must have a minimum paid up share of 5,00,000 rupees or such higher amount as may be prescribed.
And a private company is required to have a minimum paid up share capital of 1,00,000 rupee such or such hire amount as may be prescribed by its articles.
Where is Section sections 4 sub clause 1E of the Companies Act 2013 lays down no amount of minimum paid up share capital in case of both public or private company.
It just says that amount of share capital with which a company is to be registered.
And division of the same into shares which the subscribers to the memorandum agrees to subscribe shall not be less than 1 share.
And the number of the shares its subscriber to the memorandum intense to take should be indicated opposite his name.
This means no separate subscription clause is laid down in section 2013 as it was laid down in ccompanies act, 1956.
we will discuss about the Articles of Association.
Articles of Association are the second document which has to be registered along with the memorandum of articles of association of a company in case of some companies.
Companies which must have articles of association are unlimited companies.
Companies limited by guarantee and private companies limited by shares.
This document contains rules, regulation and by laws for the general administration of the company.
They may be prescribed as the internal regulation of the company governing its management emboarding the powers of the directors.
And officers of the company as well as the powers of the shareholders.
They lay down the mode and the manner in which the business of a company is to be conducted.
In framing of articles of association a care must be taken to see that regulations framed do not go beyond the past of the company itself.
And as as contemplated by the memorandum of association and nor should they be such as would violate any of the requirements of the Companies Act itself.
All clauses in the articles ultra-virus the Memorandum or the act shall be null and void.
we will discuss about the contents of articles of association.
Articles generally contain provisions relating to the following matters.
First share capital, different classes of shares of the shareholders and variations of their rights.
Second, allotment of shares.
Third, Calls on shares.
Fourth, Issue of share certificate.
Fifth, Issue of share warrants.
Sixth, transfer of shares.
Seventh, transmission of shares.
Eight , alteration of share capital.
Ninth, borrowing powers of the company.
Tenth , Rules regarding meetings.
Eleventh , Voting rights of the member.
Twelvth , Accounts and Audit.
Thirteenth , directors, their appointment and remuneration.
Fourteenth, Payment interest of the capital.
Fifteenth , common seal .
And sixteenth , winding up of a company.
According to Section 5 of the Companies Act ,2013 articles of a company contain the regulations for management of a company.
They contain prescribed content but additional content may be added if necessary for management of a company.
The articles may provide for entrenchment which means that entrance regulations or entrenched clauses of articles can be altered only under conditions which are more restrictive than the special resolutions.
Which is generally required for alteration of articles.
Provisions for entrenchment may be made at the time of formation of a company or later on by an ordinary resolution in case of a private company.
And while special resolution in the case of a public company.
Now, how can alteration of articles of a company be done.
Section 31 of the Companies Act ,1956 grants power to the every company to alter its articles whenever its desires by passing a special resolution.
Second distinction.
Fourth distinction is memorandum every company must have its own memorandum.
Whereas under the companies act it is necessary for all types of companies to have articles.
Fifth distinction is any act of the company which is ultra vire.
The memorandum is holy void and cannot be ratified even by the whole body of shareholders.
Where as under articles, any of the act of the company which is the ultravire the articles can be confirm by the shareholders if it is intra vires the memorandum.
we will talk about the doctrine of constructive notice.
What do we mean by the doctrine of constructive notice? Every person dealing with the company is deemed to have a constructive notice of the contents of the memorandum and articles of the company.
A person is expected to inspect the basic document of the company which are memorandum and articles.
And they are available at the office of the registrar of a company.
An outsider dealing with the company is presumed to have read the contents of the registered documents of the company.
The further presumption is that he has not only read inspected the documents but also have understood them fully in the proper sense.
So, the doctrine of rule of constructive notice is a presumption operating in favor of the companies against the outsider.
we will talk about the Doctrine of Indoor Management.
This doctrine is an exception to the doctrine of constructive notice.
This Doctrine has been applied to many companies liable in case where they deal are made by the directors.
First, whose appointment was defective.
Second, who were appointed properly but why yet to be delegated necessary authority.
Thirdly, who had not yet been appointed as directors.
Fourthly who have been delegated authority in a meeting which had been lacked quorum.
There are some exceptions to this Doctrine of Indoor Management.
Though the doctrine outsiders protection while dealing with registered companies.
Court in the case of Royal British Bank vs Turquand did not find it proper to apply the Doctrine in following cases and the protection was denied.
The first exception is knowledge of irregularity .
When a person dealing with the company has actual or constructive notice of the irregularity as regards internal management, then he cannot claim the benefit under the rule of indoor management.
He may in some cases be himself be a part of the internal procedure.
Second exception is negligence.
Where a person dealing with the company could discover the irregularity.
If he had made popular enquiries, he cannot claim the benefit of the rule of indoor management.
The protection of the rule is not available where the circumstances surrounding the contract a so suspicious as to invite enquiry and the outsider dealing with the company does not make proper enquiry.
Third is forgery.
Fourth is acts outside the scope of apparent authority.
If an officer of a company enters into a contract with the third party.
And if the act of the officer is beyond the scope of its authority, the company is not bound.
The Companies Act, 2013 stipulates the process of registration and incorporation of companies in India for all types of companies including private and public companies minimum 2 directors and 2 shareholders are required for incorporating a private company where is minimum 3 directors in 7 shareholders are required for incorporating a public company.
Minimum paid up share capital of a private company at the time of incorporation should be 1 lakh rupees and it should be rupees 5 lacs for a public company .
Companies which are set up with the foreign investment have to be incorporated under the Companies Act, 2013 with the registrar of the companies.
Once the company is registered in India, it is guided by the Indian laws.
A company is formed by registering the memorandum and articles of association with the registrar of companies of the state in which the office of the company is to be located.
Now will discuss about the registration of companies, doing business in a company form of organization gives it's promoters all the advantages of a corporate personality, which includes separate corporate existence.
If you incorporate a company you will not be held personally liable for certain accidents and liabilities consequently ,you may find it easier to obtain business insurance or attract investors.
Since they don't know, you are not personally responsible for the company's wellbeing, following the above reasons registration of a company is an important part of starting a business.
Therefore before registering a company one needs to fulfill some legal formalities for which promoters must make a decision regarding the type of company they want to start.
That is a public company or a private company or Limited or unlimited company and accordingly prepare documents for incorporation of company.
In this connection the memorandum and articles of association now known as memorandum and articles respectively in the Act, of 2013 are fundamental documents to be prepared.
Now formation of a company: section 3 of Companies Act, 2013 lays down the process of forming a company.
The section states that a company can be formed for any lawful purpose by 7 or more persons in case of public company and 2 or more persons in case of private company and by 1 person in the case of 1% company which is regarded as a private company by the 2013 Act.
They can do that by subscribing the names to a memorandum and complying with the requirements of the Act to Act, of 2013 in respect of a registration.
Section also states that the companies formed under subsection 1 May be either a company limited by shares or a company limited by guarantee or unlimited company ,provided that the memorandum of one person company shall indicate the name of the other person with his prior concern for the same and for the purpose of becoming a member of the company in the event of the subscribers death or his in capacity to contract .
It is also laid down in the Act, that the written consent should be filed with the registrar at the time of incorporation of the 1% company along with it a memorandum and articles by the said other person nominated should we filed.
It is further provided by the Act that if such other persons want to withdraw his consent he can do the same in the prescribed manner only.
In case of 1% company ,if some changes are brought in in regards of change in the name of the person or any other change then the company shall intimate to this registrar in the manner prescribed.
Now will talk about the memorandum and articles of association of a company.
In the case of Moosa Goolam Arif versus Ebrahim Goolam Arif, it was held by the court that the certificate of incorporation is a conclusive evidence for all purposes.
Now will talk about the pre incorporation contracts.
Sometimes contracts are made on behalf of a company even before it is duly incorporated.
But no contract can bind a company before it becomes capable of contracting, by incorporation .
2 consenting parties are necessary to a contract, whereas the company before incorporation is a non-entity and this was held in the case of Kenya versus baxter.
A company has no status prior to incorporation.
It can have no income before incorporation for tax purposes .
Shares cannot be acquired in the name of the company before incorporation and the transfer form is liable to be rejected where the name of a proposed company is entered in the column of a transferee .
Before incorporation of a company is concerned and done and this was held in the case of English and colonial procedure company.
In order to get the benefits of a corporate personality it is very necessary for an association of person to become incorporated under the Companies Act.
It would be a matter of inconvenience that an association of persons cannot perform any official business operation in the name of company before its incorporated.
Therefore promoters of a company may enter into the agreement for the benefit of the association of person or prospective company and these agreements are known as pre incorporation contracts.
One might question that why is company not liable even if it is beneficiary to contract or might also question that doesn't promoters work under principal agent relationship answer to such question with simple.
The company is not in legal existence at time of pre incorporation contracts.
A person not in legal existence cannot be a party to a contract as we all know and the previty to contract doctrine excludes company from this liability and this was held in the case of Canada versus Baxter and Phonogram Limited versus Lane case.
This position was confirmed , in pure common law sense, pre incorporation contracts does not bind the company.
But there are certain exceptions to this contract and these exceptions were developed in USA India and later in England.
These exceptions are first under the Specific Relief Act 1963, Section 15(h) and section 19(e) are the two important sections for pre incorporation contract .
Section 15 is about strangers right to sue, if he is entitled to a benefit or has any interest under the contract.
Although it has certain limitations, section 15(h) talks about the company being a stranger to Prem Corporation contract has the right to sue to the other contracting party.
But the necessary condition is that the contract should be warranted by the terms of its Incorporation .
This provision clearly negates the Common Law Doctrine which says that the company cannot ratify or adopt the pre incorporation contract.
Under this provision promoters can give his right to sue to the company whereas the relevant portion of section 19 sub clause(e) states that except otherwise provided by this chapter, specific performance of a contract maybe and enforced against ,when promoters of a company have before its incorporation entered into a contract, warranted by the terms of the incorporation provided that the company has accepted the contract and communicated such acceptance to the other party to the contract .
This position was accepted in the case of Vali Pattabhirama Rao And Anr. vs Sri Ramanuja Ginning And Rice Factory Private Limited.
The second exception is novation of contract .
What do we mean by novation of contract?In the situation of novation of contract, the company can replace the promoter from the pre incorporation contract.
But one might say that such contract would not be called pre incorporation contract ,but it should be called post incorporation contract because novation of contract result into a new contract.
This position of novation of contract was accepted in the case of Howard vs Patent Ivory Company manufacturing company.
Now will talk about the incorporation of company under the Companies Act, 2013 .
Under the Companies Act, 1956 for incorporation all the important documents are filed with the registrar of the company .
There as under 2013 section 7 talks about the incorporation of a company and its states that the documents shall be filed by the company to the registrar within whose jurisdiction the registered office of a company is proposed to be situated.
Subsection 1 of section 7 Lays down the list of following documents and information which is required to be filed by the company for incorporation.
Sub section 3 of section 7 of this Act states that on inform the date mentioned in the certificate of incorporation the registrar shall allow to the company a corporate Identity Number ,which will provide a distinct identity to the company and will also be mentioned in the certificate.
Under the present Act of 2013 the company shall also maintain and preserve at its registered office all the documents and information filed and if any person furnishes any false information, he shall be liable under section 477 of the given Act.
Regarding the above penal action or Tribunal may pass an order, as it may think fit for regulation of the management of the company or may direct to remove the name of the company from the register of the companies on being satisfied.
After the certificate of incorporation issue the registrar shall allot the company corporate Identity Number as we have already discussed.
Provided that before passing any order in regard the Tribunal should give a company a reasonable opportunity of being heard and the Tribunal shall take into consideration the transaction entered by the company including the obligations if any contracted or payment of any liability.
Now we will talk about the commencement of business under the Companies Act, 1956 a private company had the right to commence its business right from the date of its Incorporation.
However in the case of a public company a certificate of commencement of business have to be obtained .
For this purpose the following additional formalities had to be complied with section 149(7) of the Companies Act, 1956 .
If a company had a share capital and had issued a prospectus ,then first shares up to the amount of minimum subscription must be allotted.
Secondly every director must have paid to the company one company on each of the shares which he has taken same amount as the public have paid on such shares .
Thirdly no money is or may become payable to the applicants of shares or debentures for failure to apply for or to obtain permission to deal in in those shares or debentures in any recognized stock exchange.
Fourthly a statutory declaration in form 19 signed by one director or the employee, company secretary or a company secretary in whole time practice that the above provisions have been complied must be filed.
And if a company has share capital but did not issue a prospectus, then what happens in this case?First it must file a statement in lieu of prospectus with the registrar of the companies.
Every director must have paid to the company on each of the shares which he has taken same amount as the other members has paid on such shares.
Thirdly a statutory declaration in form 20 by 1 director or the employee a company secretary or a company secretary in whole time practice that the above provisions have been complied with must be filed.
Once the above provisions have been complied with the registrar of the company grants certificate of commencement of business after which the company can comments is activities.
Under the Companies Act, 2013 a company having a share capital is not entitled to commence its business or exercise borrowings pars unless firstly a declaration is filed by the director of the company with the registrar of the companies that every subscriber to the memorandum has paid the value of the shares agreed to have been taken by him and the paid up share capital of the company is rupees 5 lacs.
In case of a public company and 1 lakh in the case of the private company secondly the company has file with the registrar of the companies of verification of its registered office.
In case no declaration is filed by director of the company within 180 days of the incorporation of the company the ROC has reasonable belief that the company is not carrying on any business or is not in operation and he may initiate action for removal of companies name from the register of the companies.
Now let's look at the procedure for formation of a company in India.
What are the different steps a person has to follow to form its company under Indian law the first step is to obtain directors identification number for the proposed directors of the company.
Third step is to file an application for the approval of the name of the company fourth step is preparing the memorandum of association and articles of association of the company which are very important document.
Fifth step is to have the appropriate Number of persons to subscribe to the Memorandum of the company minimum 2 in the case of private company and minimum 7 in the case of public company as we have already discussed it.
Sixth step is to submit all the documents along with the required fees to the registrar of the company .
Seventh step is registrar of the company should issue a receipt of certificate of incorporation after all these documents are filed by the company in prescribed manner, then the eighth step is in case of a public company obtain a certificate of commencement of business from ROC.
Finally after doing all these formalities a company come into existence and you can start your business.
Now let's talk about companies incorporation fourth amendment rules, 2016 and simplified process for incorporating companies electronically that is SPICe form.

Hello everyone I am Dr. Aparajita Bhatt from National Law University Delhi.
The topic for this modulus is Compromise, Arrangement, Reconstruction, Mergers and Amalgamation of companies in India.
You shall be able to understand about the concept of corporate restructuring, merger and amalgamation other learning objectives are that you shall also be able to understand about the legal provisions related to mergers and amalgamations under the Companies Act, 2013.
And you shall also be able to understand about the role of Judiciary on National Company Law Tribunal in sanctioning the scheme of merger or amalgamation.
We shall discuss under this module the meaning of corporate restructuring, the need of corporate restructuring, various forms of corporate restructuring and the legal issues pertaining to mergers and amalgamations in India.
Now before we proceed we must understand and discuss the meaning of corporate restructuring as to what is meant by this term.
Corporate restructuring is a general term used for various kinds of business transactions which are required for the growth of a company.
Such business transactions are governed by different regulations in different jurisdictions.
Now what is the need for corporate restructuring we must understand this.
Companies restructure themselves they have to mandatorily reach restructure themselves for two basic purposes.
The first one is the survival of the purpose of basic sustenance in the market in the industry and the second important reason is growth.
There are various forms of corporate restructuring which are prevalent in the corporate sector.
One such form is organic or which is also known as internal restructuring.
Organic restructuring is done within the organ of the company within the system of the company.
It can be divided into following categories: Operational restructuring, financial restructuring, managerial restructuring.
Now all these three kinds of restructuring are done within the organ of the company and therefore they are known as organic restructuring or internal restructuring.
Another kind of restructuring is inorganic or external restructuring.
They can be divided into say mergers, amalgamations, acquisitions.
All these are forms of inorganic or external restructuring because an external company or an external element is involved into the entire process of restructuring.
There are various other common forms of corporate restructuring exercises and they include expansion.
In case of expansion the most common forms of expansion are merger, amalgamation, tender offers and joint ventures.
Another category is sell offs which includes spin offs, split offs, split ups, divestitures and equity carve outs.
Another kind of corporate restructuring activity is corporate control which includes exercises such as premium buybacks, standstill agreements, anti-takeover amendments, proxy contests etc.
And the last category can be the changes in ownership structure which includes share repurchase, various exchange offers and going private such as LBOs and MBOs that is Leverage Buyout and Management Buyout.
Now there are many reasons why company should restructure themselves which we’ll discuss under this topic that is reasons for corporate restructuring.
The most common reason are for example such has economies of scale, synergy.
So therefore we can divide these reasons into following categories: One can be the companies wish to concentrate on area of core competency or area of their specialization.
Another can be to achieve economies of scale by expansion.
Companies also restructure themselves for geographical and product diversification.
They also wish to achieve operational synergy and efficient allocation of managerial capabilities.
Another important reason for corporate restructuring is the revival and rehabilitation of sick companies.
Vertical integration it enables acquiring constant supply of raw material and access to scientific research and technical knowhow and companies also restructure themselves to improve corporate performance and bring it at par with their competitors.
Now let's discuss and understand the meaning of each one of these forms of corporate restructuring exercises very briefly.
The first one is merger.
What is a merger? Merger is the combination of two or more companies into a single company where one survives and the other loses its identity.
Now in case of a merger all the assets, all the liabilities and all the shareholders that are transferred by the transferor company to the transferee company.
And the consideration in such a case is in the form of equity shares debentures or a combination of two or three modes.
So merger the difference of the amalgamation.
In case of merger there are two companies A and B so when they merge either A would survive or B would survive, whichever is the stronger company whichever is the healthy company.
But in case of amalgamation when both the companies so amalgamate or blend into each other to form a third new entity that is <eqn>A plus b is equals to C</eqn> then that is a case of amalgamation.
So what exactly is an amalgamation? An amalgamation is the blending of two or more companies existing undertaking into one undertaking.
The shareholders of each blending company they become the shareholders of the company which is the blended one which is the new entity.
And the assets and liabilities of both the companies are transferred to the newly formed entity.
In such a case the offer is to purchase some or all of shareholder shares in a corporation.
The price offered and tender offer is usually at a premium to the market price and it can be either friendly or unfriendly.
What are joint ventures? Joint ventures are intersection of only a small fraction of the activities of the companies involved.
It is done for a limited duration of 10 to 15 years or even less.
The companies may represent a separate entity in which each of the parties makes cash and other forms of investments.
It is a business agreement in which parties agree to develop, for a finite period and the new entity and new assets by contributing equity.
In case of a joint venture the companies exercise control over the enterprise and share revenues, they share expenses and they also share assets.
And because of this sharing nature they are known as joint ventures.
And in this case cash or equivalent consideration is received by the divesting firm.
The buyer is an existing firms so that no new legal entity results in case of a divestiture and it simply represents a form of expansion on the part of the buying firm.
Similarly equity carve-out is another variant it is the Initial Public Offering that is IPO of some portion of the common stock of a wholly owned subsidiary.
They are also referred as the "Split-off IPOs".
It involves the sale of a portion of the firm via an equity offering to outsiders.
New shares of equity they are sold to outsiders which give them ownership of a portion of the previously existing firm.
And in this case a new legal entity is created.
Similarly premium buy-backs say an another form of corporate restructuring exercise wherein the repurchase of a substantial stockholders ownership interest at a premium above the market prices is done.
A standstill agreement is written and it represents a voluntary contract in which the stockholders simply agrees not to increase his or her ownership beyond the ownership which is there in the hands of the management which presumably would put him or her in an effective control position.
Antita keover amendments they are changes in the corporate by laws to make an acquisition of the company more difficult or more expensive.
Similarly proxy contest, in this case an outside group seeks to obtain representation on the firms board of directors.
"Dissidents" or "insurgents" who seek to reduce the control position of the "incumbents" or existing board of directors.
And therefore in this case usually it is regarded as directed against the existing management of the company.
This is the proxy contest.
Changes in ownership structure in such a case the exchange offers where in the exchange of debt or preferred stock for common stock is done.
And in case of share repurchase the corporation buys back some fraction of its outstanding shares of common stock.
Another firm is going private transaction which includes activities such as LBOs that is Leveraged Buyout and MBOs that is Management Buyout.
Going private transactions typically include members of the incumbent management group who obtain a substantial proportion of the equity ownership of the newly private company.
When the transaction is initiated by the incumbent management it is referred to as management buy-out.
And in case of leveraged buy-out a type of aggressive business practice whereby the investors or a larger Corporation utilizes borrowed funds or debt to finance its acquisition.
Now integration or merger can further be divided into vertical merger, horizontal merger, conglomerate merger.
In case of an horizontal merger two firms which operate in the same kind of business activity they merge with each other, the main purpose of this kind of merger is to obtain economies of scale to reduce the investment in operations and broadening the products line, reduction in investment in working capital, elimination of competition concentration, in products reduction of advertising costs and increase in market area.
And an example of horizontal merger can be a merger between two steel firms would be a case of horizontal merger.
Similarly in case of a vertical merger or vertical integration it is done to expand espousing backward integration to assimilate the sources of supply and forward integration towards market outlets.
In case of a vertical integration the acquiring company through merger of another units attempts on reduction of inventories and it implements its production plans as per objectives and economizes on working capital investment.
In a vertical combination, the merging undertaking would be either a supplier or buyer using its product as intermediary material for its final production.
And in case of a conglomerate merger this is a merger between two unrelated business firms.
So the basic purpose of conglomerate amalgamations remains utilization of financial resources and enlarged debt capacity through reorganizing their financial structure.
It also enhances the overall activity of the acquirer company and creates balance in companies total portfolio of diverse products and production processes.
Demerger is another form of corporate restructuring exercise in which a case the corporate splits or divide the companies.
It’s a division of the company.
It signifies the movement in the company just opposite to merger just opposite to combination.
This particular kind of restructuring exercise is common in developed nation such as U.K and U.S.A and also in developing nations like India.
We find many examples of demerger taking place in Indian corporate sector a common example is when Reliance Industries Limited demerged into various other undertakings.
Another variants is or a form of corporate restructuring is reverse merger, this is also known as reverse takeovers or reverse IPOs and it is a way for private companies to go public.
It is a simpler, shorter and expensive way to restructure itself.
A conventional IPO is more complicated and expensive, as private companies they have to hire and invest bank to underwrite and issue shares of the soon-to-be public companies.
So reverse merger is a good alternative to the traditional IP route.
After having discussed these various forms of corporate restructuring exercises now let us discuss the legal provisions relating to mergers and amalgamations under the Companies Act 2013.
Companies Act 2013 is the new at and it has replaced the provisions of the Companies Act 1956.
But the sections related to mergers and amalgamations under the Companies Act 2013 they are still not notified and they are still not enforce.
Still the main provisions are given from section 230 onwards the corresponding provisions were given under section 391 to 396 of the Companies Act 1956.
To merge or to amalgamates is a power of the company which is conferred on the company by the Companies Act 1956 and now the Companies Act 2013.
So Companies Act 2013 section 230 makes it a power to compromise and make arrangements with creditors and members.
In this case there is an entire procedure given by the act which the companies have to mandatory follow.
One such procedure is to come out various disclosures, so the company is required to disclose the following information to the Tribunal.
The first information is that all material facts relating to the company, such as latest financial position, the latest auditor's report, pendency of any investigation of proceeding against the company they have to be disclosed.
Another important disclosure is that is there if any reduction of share capital of the company if there is any then it should be included in the compromise or arrangement and another disclosure is that any scheme of corporate debt restructuring consented to by not less than 75% of the secured creditors and value.
So therefore for this power to be exercise under section 230 the companies have to obtain at least 75% of the consent of secured creditors in value.
Similarly it requires and it mandates that notice of the meeting with has been convened or conducted or called upon by the tribunal and by the high court under the Companies Act 1956.
Such a notice of this meeting should be individually sent to all the creditors and their classes to all the members and their classes and to all the debenture holders classes.
Such notice should be placed on the website of the company.
If the company is a listed company then all these documents shall be notified to SEBI that I Securities Exchange Board of India and also the stock exchanges where the securities of the companies listed.
The notice shall also be published in the newspaper and the notice shall be sent to all the regulatory authorities another sectoral regulator's.
It is a mandatory provision that now for all the purposes of transparency and to make sure that things are done in a fair and just manner.
The notice should be sent to all the regulatory authorities including SEBI including Central Government, the state government, all the stock exchanges where the stock the shares of the company are listed, the RBI registrar of companies and therefore it should be sent to all sectoral regulators and all other regulators.
The tribunal has to satisfy itself on various grounds before sanctioning the scheme.
No scheme shall be sanctioned unless a certificate by the companies auditor has been filed with the tribunal to the effect that the accounting treatment is in conformity with the accounting standards.
Now before sanctioning the scheme there are various grounds depending on which the tribunal will sanction the scheme.
The grounds are that the scheme should be just, the scheme should be fair, it should be reasonable, it should not be against public interest and it should not be against interest of the minority shareholders.
Now under the Companies Act 1956 section 391 is supposed to be or was supposed to be a complete code in itself and it was considered to be a single window clearance system.
The whole purpose is to reconstitute the company without the company being required to make a number of applications under the Companies Act.
For various alterations which are required under the merger scheme and which may be required in the memorandum and the articles of a company.
So therefore all such alterations are done at the stage of section 391 under the Companies Act 1956 and under section 230 under the Companies Act 2013.
And this is one reason why it is known as a complete code in itself a single window clearance system.
But now there is a complete contract from the previous act to the new act that because consent has to be taken, representation has to be made by all the sectoral regulator, notice has to be sent to all the sectoral regulators, it is no more a single window clearance system now it has become a multiple window clearance system.
We also discuss that the scheme should not only be just and fair but it should also appear to be reasonable.
What is meant by reasonableness of a scheme? It means that the arrangements can reasonably be suppose by sensible business people to be for the benefit of the class which they represent.
Now there are various case laws to be disclosed under this.
One such case is Sidhpur Mills Company Limited In re, decided the 1980 by Gujarat Court.
It was held in this case that the scheme should be looked at from the view point of ordinary reasonable shareholder acting in a business like manner taking within his comprehensions and bearing in mind all the circumstances prevailing at the time when the meeting was called upon to consider the scheme.
Though the court would see whether a scheme is fair and reasonable, the initial burden in this respect would be that of the petitioner.
The same ratio was followed in another case that is in Navjeevan Mills Limited.
 decided in 1972 it was also held that the scheme should not contravene any law and should not be mala fide for a collateral purpose.
Other court would look into or the National Company Law Tribunal would look into the bonafides of the proponent, it would see that whether it is in public interest and reasonable and also in the interest of creditors of the company.
Another landmark judgments in this respect is that of Hindustan liver Employees Union vs Hindustan Lever Limited decided in 1995 by the supreme court.
It was held in this case that unless it is shown that there is some illegality or fraud involved in the scheme the court cannot decline to sanction scheme of arrangement.
It was also held that where a scheme of amalgamation is sanctioned almost unanimously by the shareholders, debenture holders, secured creditors, unsecured creditors and preference shareholders of both the companies there must exist very strong reasons for withholding sanction to such a scheme.
With holding of sanction in such a case may turn out to be disastrous for shareholders and employees and also for the economy of the country.
Now it is the discretionary power of the court or the tribunal under the Companies Act 2013 which is exercise.
On the issue of "discretion of the court" the court enjoys vast powers, wide powers of discretion.
Such power of discretion ranges from ordering the meeting, refusing a meeting, sanctioning a scheme, rejecting a refusing a scheme, making order to modify the scheme, as well as to wind up the companies where schemes are not workable.
An important case law in this regard is Mahendra Kumar Sanghi vs. Ratan Kumar Sanghi.
In this case it was held that it is obligatory upon the court to scrutinize the scheme and to see whether it conforms to the standards of reasonableness.
It must also be ensured that the majority having interest of its own clashing with those of the minority whom they seek to coerce.
So therefore the minority vs. majority interest should also be checked before sanctioning approving the scheme of merger.
Another important decision was that the scheme once passed or once approved by the court or the tribunal it becomes binding on the company, on all the creditors or members or the classes or in case of a company being wound up on the liquidator and the contributories of the company.
It shall have the same binding effects as the order of a High Court.
No scheme shall be sanctioned unless a certificate by the company’s auditor has been filed with the tribunal to the effect that the accounting treatment is in conformity with the accounting standards.
Now under section 231 of the Companies Act 2013 the tribunal enjoys vast power to enforce compromise and arrangement.
And as we just discuss these powers are of the nature of the tribunal can order a meeting, it can sanction a scheme, it can reject the scheme, it can modify the scheme, as well as it can make order to wind up the companies, if the ground for winding up are present there.
Now mergers and amalgamation of companies provisions relating to this are provided under section 232.
Section 232 is a facilitator provision it facilitates mergers and amalgamation under the companies act.
It says and states that whether it is shown to the tribunal that the compromise or arrangement has been proposed for the purpose of reconstruction of the company and under the scheme the whole or any part of the undertaking, property or liability of the transferor company is required to be transferred to the transferee company.
The tribunal may order a meeting of the creditors or members or their classes.
The tribunal in such a case may make the following provision: The transfer of the whole or part of the undertaking property or liability of the transferor company to the transferee company.
The allotment or appropriation by the transferee company of any shares, debentures, policies or other instruments in the company.
The continuation by or against the transferee company of any legal proceeding pending by or against the transferor company on the date of the transfer.
Dissolution it can also order direct dissolution of the company without winding up of any transferor company.
It can also order or make provision for the transfer of the employees of the transferor company to the transferee company.
And also make provisions such for such incidental, consequential and supplemental matter as are deemed necessary to secure that the merger and amalgamation is fully and effectively carried out.
Section 234 of the New Companies Act 2013 provides and facilitate cross border mergers.
Now this profession is a little different from the similar provision under the previous companies Act.
Whereas under the Companies Act 1956 it allowed only one way cross border merger that was anybody corporate was allowed to merge with an Indian company which is incorporated under the Indian companies Act whereas the vice versa was not allowed.
Now under section 234 two way cross border mergers and amalgamations are allowed.
So now an Indian company can merge with the foreign company and also a foreign company can merge into a Indian company.
This is subject to the approval of RBI the central bank.
And that through with selected jurisdictions only.
Amalgamation of companies in public interest is provided under section 237 of the New Companies act 2013.
This particular provision it provides us with faster process of amalgamation of companies.
The power in this case to order such a kind of amalgamation is vested directly into the hands of central government.
It provides for redressal mechanism for the dissenting shareholders and provides that any person whose aggrieved by the assessment of compensation made by the prescribed authority within a period of 30 days may prefer an appeal to the tribunal.
Another important provision under the New Companies act is with respect to mergers and amalgamations for revival and rehabilitation of sick companies.
This is given under section 261 of the new companies Act.
It provides that the company administrator may draft a scheme and provide for the amalgamation of the sick company with any other company or any other company with the sick company.
So both way merger and amalgamation is allowed.
The scheme so drafted by the administrator may also provide for the takeover of a sick company by a solvent company.
Now after having discussed these important legal provisions we also should understand and analyze as to what is the role of judiciary in sanctioning the scheme of merger.
Under the Companies Act 1956 High Court enjoyed and still enjoys wide powers to sanction a scheme and approve such scheme.
The powers of the tribunal now under the 2013 act they include power to sanction the scheme, power to stay proceedings, power to reject or modify the scheme and power to order winding up of the companies.
Important case laws are required to be discussed here which would help us to understand the role of judiciary in not only explaining the meaning of important terms as well as also making us understand the entire procedure before sanctioning the scheme.
One such important case is Saraswathi Industrial Syndicate vs. CIT, Haryana decided in 1991 by the Apex court.
It was held and the Supreme Court explained the concept of amalgamation.
The court stated that is in amalgamation two or more companies are fused into one by merger or by one taking over the other.
When two companies are merged and are so joined as to form a third company or one is absorbed into the other or blended with another the amalgamating company loses its identity.
There may be amalgamation either by transfer of two or more undertakings to an existing company.
Similarly another important case General Radio and Appliances Limited vs. M.A.Khader, decided in 1986 by the Supreme Court.
It was stated in this case that after the amalgamation of two companies the transferor company acquires a new status and it is not possible to treat the two companies at partners or jointly liable in respect of their liabilities and assets.
Very important issue which arises here is that whether anyone has the right to raise objection to the scheme or not.
Now, because the entire procedure of sanctioning the scheme is based on a fundamental principle of corporate democracy.
It is important to give this right to raise objection and make representation to the stakeholder.
Now there is a difference on this point between the Companies Act 1956 and Companies Act 2013 whereas under Companies Act 1956, any interested party was allowed to raise objection at any stage before the court approved the scheme.
Under the Companies Act 2013 only those shareholders can raise an objection who hold at least 10% of shareholding or only those creditors can raise objection who hold at least 5% of outstanding debt.
Therefore the New Companies Act that has provided a criteria for those people, for those shareholders, stakeholders, creditors who have a right to raise objection and now it is not that anyone can raise objection anytime this is just to make sure that they are not many frivolous preparations of frivolous applications for the rejection of the scheme that a put up of pending before the Judiciary before the court or before the tribunal.
Therefore now we conclude today under this module we discussed the concept, the meaning of corporate restructuring, various forms of corporate restructuring, the need for corporate restructuring.
We also discussed what are the various forms of mergers that is vertical merger, horizontal merger, conglomerate merger then we discuss the legal provisions pertaining to mergers and amalgamation under the New Companies Act 2013 and finally we also discuss few relevant, few important judgments of the Supreme Court.
Wherein the court explained the concept of amalgamation, explained the concept of merger and also explained various criteria for example it was laid down in Miheer H Mafatlal vs. Mafatlal Industries Limited.
Also in the case of Hindustan Lever Employees Union Limited that any scheme of merger should not be against minority interest, should not be against public interest.
It should be just, it should be fair, it should be reasonable.
Therefore these are various criteria’s which the judiciary, which the tribunal has to make sure of before approving or before sanctioning a scheme of merger or amalgamation.
Hello everyone, I am Dr. Aparajita Bhatt from National Law University Delhi.
The topic for this module is takeovers and acquisitions.
The learning objectives of this module are that you shall be able to understand the concept of takeovers and acquisitions.
You shall also be able to understand and appreciate the difference between takeover, acquisition and mergers and you should also be able to understand where is legal provisions governing takeovers in India.
We must understand what is meant by takeover.
Takeover and acquisition is a form of inorganic corporate restructuring where the management of the company changes its hands.
A takeover takes place when one company acquires controlling interest over another company.
There are many kinds of takeovers which are prevalent in the corporate sector.
One is friendly takeover for example when Dabur required Balsara group that’s an example of friendly takeover.
Another category is hostile takeover for example when HP acquired Compaq and the third new category which is altogether different is Bailout takeover.
Now let us briefly understand the meaning of all these 3 kinds of takeovers.
In case of a friendly takeover when it is done with the consent of board of directors or board of management of the target company.
So, because the elements of consent is present, it is a friendly takeover.
In case of a hostile takeover, when such a takeover is done without the consent of the board of management of the target company if the board rejects the offer then the bidder continues to pursue it.
Therefore this against the wishes or without the consent of the board of management of the target company and therefore it is a hostile takeover.
And a third category which is altogether different from friendly or hostile is a bailout takeover.
In case of a bailout take over the financially weak company which is the target company is bailed out to a strong company with the interference of a financial institution or a bank.
Now let us understand the difference between a takeover and merger because both of them are inorganic or external forms of corporate restructuring exercises.
In case of merger or amalgamation both the companies become one they blend into one, they merge into one with each other, whereas in case of a takeover, there continues to be two distinct companies and the assets, liabilities and stocks they are not shared or merged.
We must also understand the difference between takeover and acquisition both these terms takeover and acquisition they sounds to be and are used to be synonymously.
But there is the difference between both these terms.
In case of an acquisition it necessary involves the purchase of shares of the target company.
Which can further leads to acquisition of voting power.
When such an acquisition of voting power or such an acquisition of shares or the purchase of shares it is within intention to take control of the target company such kind of acquisition becomes a takeover.
Therefore irrespective of whether there is a takeover of a company or not there is necessarily present an acquisition of shares and it occurs whenever shares of the target company changes hands.
Therefore in case of a takeover the element of intention to control the management of the target companies present whereas in case of a simple acquisition of shares this element of intention to control the target company is necessarily not present.
Now there are various kinds of companies as we know there are private companies in public companies which can further be divided into listed and unlisted Company.
So, the takeover procedure or mechanism of listed and unlisted company are different.
Takeover of unlisted company or presently governed by the companies act under section 395.
Under this section it is both a power as well as a duty of the acquirer company to acquire shares of the target company.
Because this is a takeover of the unlisted company it requires lesser procedural compliance but which whatever is required is mentioned under the companies act.
And the dissenting shareholders they are offered of compensation a fair compensation and they also have an option to exit the company to exit the offer if they are not interested to be involved in the process of takeover.
Whereas takeover of listed companies because they are listed on stock exchanges they are governed by SEBI the Securities Exchange Board of India.
So, takeover of listed companies is governed by SEBI takeover regulations 2011.
Now, there is a set of regulations which governs takeovers and acquisitions in India.
These regulations include the Indian Companies Act, the SEBI SAST takeover regulations 2011, the Securities Contract Regulation Act 1957 and also the Listing Agreement.
Before we proceed and discuss the legal provisions relating to take over and acquisition under the takeover court 2011.
Let us try and understand that what was the need to have this takeover code in our country.
The need to govern takeovers and acquisitions, it emerge from the need to govern those companies and those corporate houses which made it a fashion to acquire controlling interest in other companies.
Takeover turns hostile when it is done without the consent of board of directors of the target company.
So, there are all probability that such an acquisition would adversely affect the interest of minority shareholders, the other stakeholders of the target company and as we all know that take over is a corporate decision it should be beneficial not only for the acquirer company but also it should be beneficial for the shareholders at large and not merely for the benefit of the individuals.
Because of the complexity of the nature of takeover and also to protect the interest of small investors as well as the target company a need were felt to develop a code to regulate and to govern the entire process of acquisition and takeover which is base on principle of transparency, which is based on principle of fairness and equal opportunity to all.
A greater need was felt and it was realized only after the introduction of the LPG model as we all know its the liberalization, privatization, and globalization model which was introduced in 1991.
So, only after introduction of this LPG model in 1991 it was felt that we need to have a set of regulation, we need to have a code which could govern the cross border corporate restructuring activities, cross border takeovers, cross border, amalgamation and acquisitions.
Therefore this LPG model it opens the gates of Indian economy for foreign investors and it began a trend where in the companies wanted to restructure themselves by inorganic means such as merger and amalgamations.
The most important reason behind having a proper takeover regulation was to achieve the objective behind the SEBI Act.
And the main objective behind the SEBI Act is given under section 11 of the SEBI Act that is to protect the interest of the shareholders of the target companies besides achieving the desired target of the acquirer companies.
Need was felt to have a code to have a regulation which could imbibed within itself the principles of corporate democracy, the principle of transparency, fairness and equal opportunity for all.
With such brought objective SEBI enacted the takeover regulations 1994.
Which was further amended in 1997 and still further amended in the year 2011.
And now what we have to govern the takeover or acquisition activities in India is the SEBI SAST regulations 2011.
In the light of the changing market policies and changing needs of the corporate world there was again in need felt for new regulations to govern mergers and acquisitions.
Thus, in 2009 a committee which was constituted under the chairmanship of Achuthan Mr.
Now let us also discuss the trend of takeovers and acquisitions in India.
The trend of takeover and acquisitions in India it witnessed significant regulatory changes in 2011 as we just discussed.
And when this new takeover regulations 2011 came into force it brought with several unique feature which now govern the takeover transactions the acquisition transactions in a country.
And specially replies to public listed companies.
The basic principles which applies to an acquisition and the takeover is that in case of a takeover compliance of both the takeover code as well as the act is necessary.
While in case of only acquisitions specially in case of acquisition of unlisted companies compliance only of the actors required.
Similarly there are other variance which can be added to it so when acquisition becomes a takeover the provision of SEBI takeover code 2011 becomes applicable as we all know.
Similarly if an acquisition results in a combination then along with the takeover code 2011, the provisions of the Competition Act 2002, which were for the amended in 2007 would also apply and the approval of competition Commission of India is required in such a case.
And if the acquisition results in either inflow or outflow of funds to and from India then the provisions of FEMA 1999 that is the Foreign Exchange management Act 1999, would also become applicable along with the takeover code 2011.
Now after having discussed the basic, the fundamental concepts, the meaning of takeover acquisition and the differences between them now let us discuss the various legal provisions.
SEBI is a body is an authority which has given to us a very comprehensive set up regulation which governs all forms of takeover activities in India.
And therefore all kinds of takeover whether friendly, whether hostile have two necessarily go through the procedure which is given under the SEBI takeover code.
This code involves the acquisition of shares in a substantial percentage which leads to acquisition of control and finally takeover of a target company.
It also applies to acquisition by a company.
this acquisition can be acquisition of shares, acquisition of voting power and acquisition of control.
Acquisition of shares can be either direct acquisition or indirect acquisition.
Now what is direct acquisition? A direct acquisition is when control of a public listed company is by way of acquisition of shares of the target company directly.
Whereas an indirect acquisition it is done by acquiring shares of a holding company or a parent company of the target company.
Therefore both these forms of acquisition they are given under SEBI takeover code and are governed by the same regulation.
SEBI takeover code also gives to us a process which is known as an open offer process.
The takeover code mandates an open offer process for both direct as well as indirect acquisition of shares, voting rights or control if such acquisition triggers the threshold prescribed under the takeover code.
Now what is this threshold we need to understand this.
This threshold is given under regulation 3 of the takeover code 2011.
Regulation 3 gives to us the concept of substantial acquisition of shares, voting rights and control.
This percentage which is given under the takeover code 2011 was quite low under the previous takeover regulation.
It was only 15% but now they have increased it to 25% which comes in the form of relaxation both to the acquirer companies as well as to the shareholders.
The open offer process requirement should be fulfilled only when there is a substantial acquisition of shares of voting rights or control.
Having done substantial acquisition of shares or voting rights or control by making a public announcement if an acquirer has to acquire additional shares, which entitles him to exercise more than 5% of voting rights in a financial year he is again required to make public announcement of an open offer.
From this week gets the concept of creeping acquisition.
The concept of creeping acquisition allows an acquirer to acquire additional shares every year I mean every financial year up to 5% for which he is not required to follow the open offer process.
So, if he acquires 5% up to 5% in one financial year for that he is not required to make public announcement, he is not required to follow any open offer process.
So, therefore this is a slow acquisition, this is a creeping acquisition.
This can be done only once he has acquired substantial acquisition of shares, he has done substantial acquisition of shares or control or voting power.
Now under the Takeover code of 1997, as we just discussed and an acquirer was mandated to make an open offer if he alone or through persons acting in concert with him, they were acquiring 15% of more of voting right in the target company.
This threshold of 15% has been increased to 25% under the takeover code 2011.
Now what is meant by acquisition of control? Acquisition of controls substantially differs from acquisition of shares and voting power.
Takeover code mandates making of a public announcement of an open offer for acquisition of control which is done either directly or indirectly over a target company.
This is irrespective of acquisition or holding of shares or voting rights in a target company.
The code of 2011 under regulation 5 gives to us the concept of indirect acquisition of shares of control.
In case of an indirect acquisition of shares or control, the acquisition of shares, voting rights or control over any other company which would enable the acquirer of shares, voting rights or control to exercise such percentage of voting rights which would otherwise have triggered and open of a process and which would enable him to enable the acquirer to exercise control over of a company, then this becomes a kind of indirect acquisition and not a direct acquisition.
Thereby it is meant and thereby it is concluded that even in case of an indirect acquisition he has to follow the open offer process.
The concept of deemed direct acquisitions is a little different from indirect acquisition.
Few or certain indirect acquisition they are regarded as ‘deemed direct acquisition’ or ‘deemed to be direct acquisition’.
If such indirect acquisition satisfies few conditions.
These conditions are that if the proportionate net asset value of the target company as a percentage of the consolidated net asset value of the entity or business being acquired exceeds 80%.
Or the proportional sales turnover of target company as a percentage of the consolidated sales turnover of the entity or business being acquired exceeds 80%.
Or the proportionate market capitalization of the target company as a percentage of the enterprise value for the entity or business being acquired exceeds 80%.
The deemed direct acquisition in all these three cases has the follow the same mandatory open offer process related requirements which are being followed in case of a direct acquisition of shares, direct acquisition of voting rights or direct acquisition of control.
Regulations 6 of the takeover code 2011 makes us understand the concept of voluntary offer.
It provides an option to make a voluntary offer under the Takeover Code of 2011 to those shareholders who already hold at least 25% or more but less than 75% of the shares or voting rights of that company.
The reason is they wish to further consolidate their existing shareholding rights in the company then this option to exercise voluntary offer is given to such shareholders.
Voluntary offer enable such shareholders to acquire further shares representing at least 10% of the total shareholding of the company.
But making a such a voluntary offer is not without restriction.
So, therefore there are certain restrictions to make a voluntary offer for example one is it put some moratorium period.
A person who either individually or together with the persons acting in concert has acquire shares or voting rights of control in the preceding 52 weeks.
Otherwise then pursuant to an open offer is not entitled to make a voluntary offer.
Similarly, during the offer period of such voluntary offer, acquisition of shares in the target company are prohibited.
Another restriction is that the acquirer who makes the voluntary offer is not entitled to acquire any shares of the target company for a period of further six months after the completion of that voluntary offer, except by way of another voluntary offer or a completing offer.
And another restriction is that the shares proposed to be acquired under the voluntary offers should not be in such number so, as to reduce the public shareholding of the target company below the minimum permissible limit assuming that the offer is accepted in full.
Therefore these restrictions have to be followed in case of a voluntary offer and this facilitator provision or option is given to those shareholders who want to further consolidate their shareholding only after they have already made a substantial acquisition of shares or voting rights or control in the target company.
Similarly there is another requirement to be followed under the Takeover code that is what is the offer size.
we have to be aware of this particular fact that all these provisions are given under the Takeover code to make sure that a takeover or an acquisition even if done in a hostile manner or friendly manner is not against the interest of the minority shareholders or investors of target company.
Therefore what should be the offer size and a takeover is provided under regulation 7.
Regulation 7 explains that any acquirer who has already made substantial acquisition of shares or voting rights or control can make an offer for at least 26% of the total shares of the target company within a period of 10th working day from the closure of the tendering period.
Now, what does that mean? It means regulation 7 allows to make an offer size of 26% and the acquirer has already made a substantial acquisition of 25% as allowed by regulations 3.
Therefore under the New Takeover code 2011 an acquirer company in one go can acquire 25 plus 26% that is up to 51% of shareholding or voting power or control in the target company which gives a very broad scope to the acquirer company to acquire shares in the target company.
The voluntary Open offer made through public announcement under regulations 6, it enables the acquirer to acquire at least search number of shares as would entitle him to exercise an additional 10% of the total shares of the target company.
But the post acquisition holding of the acquirer should not exceed the maximum permissible non public shareholding applicable to such target company.
The limitation in terms offer size is not same in case of a competing offer.
If the offer is a competing offer and the acquirer has made a voluntary offer then he is entitled to increase the number of shares within a period of 15 working days to such number as he deems fit.
And after the lapse of these 15 days the acquirer shall not be able to increase the offer size.
Regulation 8 provides us and states as to what should be the offer price and how it should be calculated.
Which again has been stated or mentioned in the interest of the shareholders of the target company.
In case of a direct or indirect acquisition of shares or voting rights or control over the target company the offer price shall be the highest of the following: It shall be the highest negotiated price per share of the target company for any acquisition under the agreement attaching the obligation to make a public announcement of an open offer.
Or the volume weighted average price paid or payable for acquisitions whether by the acquirer or by any person acting in concert with him during the 52 week immediately preceding the date of public announcement.
Or the highest price paid or payable for any acquisition whether by way of acquirer or by any person acting in concert with him during 26 weeks immediately preceding the date of the public announcement.
The volume weighted average market price of such shares for a period of 60 trading days immediately preceding the date of public announcement as traded on the stock exchange, where the maximum volume of trading in the shares of the target company are recorded.
During such period provided such shares are frequently traded where the shares are not frequently traded the price determined by the acquirer and the manager to the open offer taking into account valuation parameters and such other parameters as a customary for valuation of shares of such company.
And the per value computed under sub-regulation 5 file if applicable.
So, therefore whichever is the highest price out of these that shall be the offer price under the takeover code 2011.
Now, what shall be the mode of payment? This again is mentioned under the takeover code under regulation 9.
The mode of payment can be either in cash or by issue exchange of transfer of listed shares and the equity share capital of the acquirer or listed secured debt instruments issued by the acquirer or issue exchange or transfer of convertible debt securities and the code also permits a combination of all these modes.
Now, the code is not without exemptions, there are few categories which are exempted from the regulations, from the procedure mention under the code these gentle exemptions are mentioned under regulation 10.
The first is acquisition pursuant to inter se transfer of shares amongst qualifying persons being immediate relatives persons named as promoters in the shareholding pattern filed by the target company in terms of listing agreement or these regulations for not less than 3 years prior to the proposed acquisition.
another exemptions is a company or its subsidiary, its holding company, other subsidiaries of such holding companies, person holding not less than 50% of the equity shares of such company or other companies in which such persons hold not less than 50% of the equity shares and they subsidiary subject to control over such qualifying persons being exclusively held by the same persons.
The exemption also includes such persons for acting in concert for not less than 3 years prior to the propose acquisition and disclose as such pursue into filings under the listing agreement.
It also applies to shareholders of a target company who have been persons acting in concert for a period of not less than 3 years prior to the propose acquisition and are disclosed as such pursuant to the filing under the listing agreement and any company in which the entire equity share capital is owned by such shareholders in the same proportion as their holdings in the target company without any differential entitlements to exercise voting rights in such company.
Therefore all this together form general exemptions under regulation 10 of the takeover code 2011.
Now after having followed all these provisions with respect to making an open offer or making a public announcement, after having understood that how voluntary offer is made, what is meant by direct and indirect acquisition, what should we offer size and what should be the offer price.
We should also understand that when this process of acquisition should be comply to be should be completed.
Therefore the provisions relating to and the procedure relating to the completion of acquisition is given under regulation 22.
Regulation 22 states that the acquisition process gets complete only after the expiry of the offer period.
The takeover code mandates the opening of an escrow account into which the amount in cash equal to 100% of the consideration as fixed between the parties has to be deposited.
That means that total hundred percent amount in cash has to be deposited into the escrow account.
After the period of 21 working days from the date of detailed public statement that is DPS, the code allows the parties to act upon the agreement and acquire shares or voting rights for control over the target company.
The maximum period for the acquirer to complete acquisition processes is 26 weeks from the expiry of the offer period.
This time period of 26 weeks may be extended by board of directors in case there is an extraordinary circumstance.
And the board of directors before granting such extension would look into the interest of investors in general.
The main issue which arises here is that if once the open offer is made or substantial acquisition offer is made then whether in a acquirer company can be withdraw such an open offer.
So, withdrawal of open offer mentioned under regulation 23 of the code.
There are only certain circumstances under which the open offer can be withdrawn otherwise it is not allowed to withdraw this open offer.
The circumstances are that if the statutory approvals required for open offer or for effecting the acquisition, attracting the obligation to make an open offer under these regulations have been finally refused by the authorities, subjects to such requirements for approval having being specifically disclosed in the detailed public statement and the letter of offer.
Another circumstance can be that the acquirer being a natural person has died.
Another situation to withdraw an open offer may arise wherein any condition stipulated in the agreement for acquisition, attracting the obligation to make the open offer is not met for reasons outside the control of the acquirer.
For such reasons which are outside the reasonable control of the acquirer and such agreement is rescinded, subject to such conditions having being specifically disclosed in the detailed public statement and the letter for offer.
Or another ground can be such circumstances as in the opinion of the board, merit withdrawal.
So, in these cases in these circumstances and open offer Once made can be withdrawn also.
But if the open offer is withdrawn then the acquirer within 2 working days is required to make an announcement in the same newspaper in which the public announcement of the open offer was published.
The code mandates information to be given in writing to the board, to all the stock exchanges on which the shares of the target company are listed and the target company at its registered office.
This is only to make sure that there is enough and there is proper communication done to the investors, to the shareholders, to the board of directors of the target company.
Now, after having discussed and , after knowing all these important provisions relating to takeover procedure, we should also understand as to the what is the role of independent directors under the takeover code.
The Takeover Code of 2011 it makes it mandatory for the board of directors of the target company to constitute a committee of independent directors.
Now these independent directors they are also entitled to seek external professional advice on the same.
So, once this committee of independent directors will be constituted, they have to provide written reason recommendation on such Open offer which the target company is required to publish.
Therefore today we discussed the concept and the meaning of takeover and acquisition.
The difference between these two important terms, they are two important inorganic corporate restructuring activities which companies undertake to acquire shares or stock or voting power or control over the target company.
But because to make sure that this is not done in an arbitrary manner, the code provides set mechanism to be followed to be complied.
It provides various unique features which were not present under the previous code.
Such as, it provides exit option for public shareholders to exit.
it also provides and states, it allows the raising of threshold for making an open offer from 15% to 25% whether it is a direct Open offer or indirect open offer.
And also it gives the revised list of exemptions and many more such unique features are there which were not present earlier.
Therefore it would be right and correct to conclude that Takeover Code 2011 focuses on the principles of corporate democracy, transparency, fairness and it also ensures the interest of investors which is the main, which is the primary objective of the SEBI act.
Thank you.
I am Deepika Prakash from National Law University, Delhi and this presentation is about auditors, their duties and liabilities and the subject of Corporate Law.
This presentation will elaborate on functions of an auditor for representation of true financial status of a company.
The major focus of it is to give an overview of the duties and liabilities of an auditor under the Companies Act, 2013 for the broader objective of corporate governance as a whole.
Now, corporate governance has become the cornerstone of Corporate Law globally.
True and fair audit other co-concerns for regulators world over.
The new Companies Act has made accounts and audit a subject to special interest and has laid down detailed provisions regarding the same.
The Act has also set up a national financial reporting authority for setting the standards for the accounting and auditing.
Now, company carries on its business with the capital provided by the shareholders and other members of the investment community.
It is important for them that their investment is safe and that it has been used for the purpose it was intended to be.
The company has to maintain number of financial books, accounts and statements for the proper accounting of the income and expenditure.
Now, these account books etc must be inspected and verified by an independent person or a firm to give a true picture of the entire financial functioning of the company.
The Institute of Chartered Accountants of India ICAI is a statutory body established under the Chartered Accountants Act of 1949 which regulates the profession of Chartered Accountants in India.
ICAI lays down the pre-qualifications, accounting standards, code of ethics as well as Education of Auditors in India.
Now, only persons who are members of ICAI with a valid certificate of the institute for accounting may be made in auditor of a company in India.
The question that comes before us is what is auditing? The main objective of auditing is to evaluate the financial statements to confirm they are accurate and truly represented in the reports.
In case auditing and accounting is not done soundly or effectively financial scams like, Satyam's happened which adversely affect the investors in the company.
Let us look into the Satyam scandal briefly: Satyam scandal is also called the Indian ENRON.
Sathyam, an IT company ‘One’ the Golden Peacock Award for the best governed company in 2007 as well as in 2009.
It was India's fourth largest company.
Satyam Scandal has turned out to be Nation's biggest corporate scandal.
Now, how was the scandal revealed? On 7th Jan, 2009 the company’s then Chairman and Founder Mr.Ramalinga Raju disclosed in a letter to the Satyam Computer Limited Board of Directors that he had been manipulating the company’s accounting numbers for years.
Mr Raju claimed that he had overstated assets on Satyam’s Balance-Sheet by 1.7 million dollars; nearly 1.4 billion dollars in bank loans and cash the completing claimed were non-existent.
A number of liabilities were also left under reported in the balance sheet.
Satyam income was also overstated almost every quarter for many years.
Mr.Raju and the companies Global Head of internal audit used a number of different techniques to perpetrate the fraud.
Using his personal computer, Mr.Raju created numerous bank statements to advance the fraud.
He falsified the bank accounts to inflate the balance sheets with balances that did not exist.
He also inflated the income statement by claiming interest income from fake bank accounts.
Mr. Raju also revealed that he had created about 6,000 fake salary accounts over the past few years and appropriated the money after the company deposited it.
The company's Global Head of internal audit created fake customer identities IDs and generated fake invoices against the name to inflate revenues.
The Global head of internal audit also was board resolution and illegally obtained loan from the company.
Now, the Founder of Satyam was subsequently arrested after he admitted falsifying the firm’s accounts.
Mr. Ramalinga Raju was charged with several offence including Criminal Conspiracy, Breach of Trust and Forgery.
Satyam share fell to an all-time low in the stock market.
The auditing company Price Water House Coopers audited Satyam book from June, 2000 until discovery of the fraud in the year 2009.
PWC has been severely criticized to give inaccurate and unreliable audit report as well as failure to detect the fraud.
Now, looking at the Satyam scandal, role of an auditor and auditing in corporate governance has become quintessential for the welfare of the company.
They also play a vital role in securing the interest of shareholders and investing communities in India.
For fair and accurate auditing the New Companies Regulation in India which is the Companies Act, 2013 under chapter 10 has brought several changes in the position and responsibility of an auditor in a company functioning in India.
Let us look briefly into this profession: the very first provisions regarding auditors are about appointment.
Section 139 of the companies at lays down that an individual or a firm which includes a Limited Liability Partnership under section 134 ,139(4) and I suppose 141(2) can be appointed as an auditor in a company.
The first auditor of a company is to be appointed at a board meeting within 30 days of registration of the company.
In case the board fails to appoint within 30 days the Auditor then the board will inform the members and the member shall appoint the auditors in the Extraordinary General Meeting of the company.
Every appointment will be for 5 years.
Provided that the company places is the matter relating to such appointments for ratification by members at every Annual General Meeting.
Auditor or Auditing Firms so appointed must give in writing consent on such appointment and certificate for himself or it that the appointment has been made in accordance with the conditions prescribed and the auditor satisfies the criteria provided under the Act.
A notice of disappointment must be filed with the registrar of the companies within 15 days of the meeting which appoints the Auditor.
These were some general rules regarding the appointment of an Auditor in company.
Now, coming to certain additional conditions of appointment under Section 139: Under Section 139 subsection 2 of the appointment revision no listed company or some other company as notified shall appoint as well as re-appoint an individual for more than one term of the five consecutive years or an audit firm for more than two terms of the five consecutive years.
Any audit firm which has a common partner with the audit firm whose tenure has just expired with the company may not be appointed as well.
The companies are required to comply with these requirements within three years of the implementation of the Act, that is from 2013 onwards.
Now let us look at the provisions on rotation of an auditor.
Section 139, subsection 3 says the members of a company may resolve to rotate in the audit firm appointed the auditing partner and his teams.
They may also resolve to get audit conducted by more than one auditor.
The rules regarding the rotation are provided in detail in the companies rules.
Now there are accepted provisions for appointment in case of a government company.
Under sub section 7 of Section 139, in case of a government company or company which is owned or controlled by the central government or State government or by both Central and state government, the first auditor shall be appointed by the Comptroller and Auditor General of India within 60 days of registration of the company .
In case the Comptroller and Auditor General of India does not appoint the first auditor within the 60 days, the board of director shall appoint Auditors within the next 30 days.
In case of failure of the board to appoint the first auditor within this period the members finally shall appoint such auditors within next 60 days.
Sachin appointed auditor which is the first auditor shall hold office until the conclusion of the first Annual General Meeting.
Now under sub-section 5, the auditor of a government company or a company controlled by Central Government or State government or partly by both, the Comptroller and Auditor General of India shall appoint within a period of 180 days from the commencement of financial year to hold office till the Annual General Meeting has concluded.
Therefore this is the entire procedure to be followed for the appointment of an auditor in a government company in India.
Now let us locate the provisions on casual vacancy of an auditor under Section 139, sub Section 8 of the Companies Act 2013.
Now when a casual vacancy arises in a company which is not a government company and if the vacancy is due to resignation of the auditor then the new appointment shall be filed by the board of directors within 30 days.
If the vacancy is due to resignation then the new appointment shall be approved by the company at a General Meeting convened within 3 months of the recommendation of the board and the auditor shall hold the office till the conclusion of the next Annual General Meeting.
Now when a casual vacancy arises in a government company the new appointment has to be made by the Comptroller and Auditor General of India within 30 days.
In case he does not fill the vacancy within the set period, the board of directors shall fill the the vacancy within the next 30 days.
Now there are certain provisions regarding reappointment of a retiring auditor which have been mentioned under section 144 of the Companies Act 2013.
Now subject to subsection 1 of section 140, a retiring auditor may be reappointed at an Annual General Meeting if first is not disqualified for reappointment, second he has not given the company a notice in writing of his unwillingness to be reappointed and third a special resolution has not been passed at the meeting appointing some other auditor or providing expressly that he shall not be appointed.
Under subsection 10 of Section 139 of the Companies Act 2013 where at any Annual General Meeting, no auditor is appointed or reappointed or the existing auditor will then in such a condition will continue to be the auditor of the company.
The Act also lays down appointment in case of an audit committee which has been mentioned under Section 139 subsection 11.
Under it where a company is required to constitute an audit committee.
Under section 177 all appointments including the filling of a casual vacancy of an auditor under this section shall be made after taking into account the recommendations of such committee.
Now let us look at the provisions regarding the removal of an auditor which have been given under section 140 of the Companies Act 2013.
An auditor of a company may be removed before the expiry of his time period only by a special resolution of the company.
This is to be obtained only after the approval of the central government has been taken in the prescribed manner mentioned under the Act itself.
Now what is the procedure when the auditor resigns? In the situation where the auditor has resigned from the company he shall file within a period of 30 days from the date of resignation the following statements depending whether the company is a government company or any other company.
Now coming to a government company, the auditor must file first, a statement is in prescribed form with the company and the registrar and second ,a statement with the Comptroller and Auditor General of India indicating the reasons and other facts as may be relevant with regards to his resignation.
Now what are the statements in case of a company other than Government Company that the auditor has to provide in case he is resigning? The resigning auditor has to firstly submit a statement in the prescribed manner with the company as well as the registrar and the Act actually provides for a penalty of rupees 50,000 in case the auditor does not comply with this procedure.
Now chapter ten also makes a provision for a special notice.
Section 148 provides for the procedure in which a retiring auditor is being reappointed.
When a retiring auditor must not be appointed? If he has completed five consecutive tenures or 10 as the case may be.
A special notice is required to be given on this behalf to reappoint or not to reappoint.
Before a resolution at an Annual General Meeting is taken up on such a matter.
Once the notice is received for resolution the company is to send a copy of the same to the retiring auditor and the retiring auditor under this section will make a written representation to the company which is to be notified to the members of the company as well.
This has to be sent by the company, so as to first state the facts of the representation having been made and second send a copy of the representation to every member of the company to whom notice of this meeting is sent whether before or after the receipt of the representation by the company.
Now in case the copy of representation is received too late or not send in the first place then the auditor will have the right to represent orally or read at the meeting itself.
A copy of the representation has to be filed with the registrar as well.
Now the Act lays down certain disqualifications under the section 141.
It says those people who shall not be eligible for appointment as an auditor of a company are there are number of points mentioned under it.
I will name some of them.
First, a body corporate other than a limited company partnership.
Second, an officer or employee of the company.
Third, a person who is a partner of who is in the employment of the officer of the employee of the company.
Fourth, a person who or his relative or partners first is holding any security of or interest in a second in is indebted to third has given a guarantee or provided any security in connection with the indebtedness of any third person to the company, its subsidiary or its holding or it’s association company or a subsidiary of such holding company.
Fifth, another person who is disqualified is a person or a firm who whether directly or indirectly has business relationship with the company or its subsidiary or its holding associate company or subsidiary of such holding company or associate companies of such nature as may be prescribed by the Act also cannot be appointed.
Sixth, a person whose relative is a director or is in the employment of the company as a director or key managerial person is also disqualified from being appointed as an auditor.
Then a person who is a full time employee elsewhere or a person or a partner of a firm holding appointment as its auditor.
If such person or partner is at the date of such appointment or reappointment holding appointment as auditor of more than 20 companies cannot be appointed as the auditor of the company.
Then a person who has been convicted by a court of an offence involving fraud and the period of 10 years has not elapsed from the date of such conviction is also disqualified and lastly any person whose subsidiary or associate company or any other form of entity is engaged as on the date of appointment in consulting and specialized services as provided under section 144.
Now, Let us look at some of the services under section 144.
They are: Accounting And Bookkeeping Services, Internal Audit, Design and Implementation of any Financial Information System, Actuary Services, Investment Advisory Services, Investment Banking Services, Rendering of Outsources, Financial Services, Management Services and any other kind of services as may be prescribed.
Therefore, we can conclude that these restrictions will prohibit and auditor from rendering certain prescribed non-audit services to the company and its holding a subsidiary company in India.
Now, once the auditor is appointed he has been granted certain powers along with certain duties to carry out.
They can be divided under various heading after analysis of the provisions of the Companies Act 2013.
Let us discuss them: first power is the right to access.
Every auditor of a company shall have a right of access at all times to the books of account and vouchers of the company whether they are kept at the registered office or any other place.
He is under this provision entitled to ask the same from the officers of the company all the information that he considers necessary for the performance of his duty as an auditor.
Section 143(1) A to F lays down the list of matters on which the auditor may seek information.
Right to access is available to an auditor or a holding company of a holding company as well under the following categories: for proper security of loans and advances, transactions by book entries, sale of asset in securities in losses, loan and advances made shown as deposits, personal expenses charged to revenue accounts and and cases where shares allotted for cash.
In all these cases right to access is given to the auditor.
The second is a duty to report; it is a duty of the auditor to make a report on every financial statement which was required by the Companies Act to be laid before the company in the General Meeting.
This report is to be in accordance to the accounting and auditing standards required under the Act.
This report has to be placed very importantly before the members of the company at the end of the financial year.
The report shall state points like, whether he has sought and obtained all the necessary information and explanations which to the best of his knowledge and belief for his audit and if not the details therefore and the effects of such information on the financial statements, then weather in his opinion proper books of accounts as required by law have been kept by the company.
So far as appears from his examination of those books and proper returns adequate for the purpose of is audit having been received from the branch not visited by him and the observations of comments of the auditor on financial transactions or matters which have adverse effect on the functioning of the company.
A more detailed list is given under the act which may be referred.
Another duty of an auditor is to prepare the branch report.
The branch auditor shall also prepare a report on the accounts of the branch examined by him.
This report is to be sent to the auditor of the company who shall deal with it in his report in such manner as he considered it necessary.
Then, one of the major duties of auditor is to conduct audit and prepare the report as per the accounting standards recognized by law.
The central government notifies these standards after consulting with the national financial reporting authority created under the Companies Act, 2013.
Then, there is a duty to report a fraud.
A critical duty under this section is, that has been assigned to the auditor is that whenever during his appointment he has reasons to believe that an offence involving fraud is being committed against the company by its officers or employees he has to immediately report the matter to the Central Government within such time and in such manner as prescribed under the Act.
Sub section 13 elaborates on this duty by adding that an auditor will not be made subject to contraventions of any other duty by reason of his reporting the fraud if it is done by him in good faith.
Then there is another duty which is to sign the audit report.
The auditor has to sign the audit report or sign or certify any other document of the company in accordance with the provisions of sub section 2 of section 141.
Now, all the observations qualifications as well as comments of the auditor on the financial transactions or matters which have adverse effect on the functioning of the company and which have been mentioned by the auditor in his report have to be read before the company in the General Meeting and will be open to inspection by any member of the company.
Then, another right is that of the auditor to attend meetings the auditor under section 146 has to be forwarded all notices regarding the general meetings of the company.
He, unless exempted by the company itself has to himself or through his authorized representation who must be a qualified auditor as well attend the General Meeting and have the right to be heard at such meeting.
Now, coming to the liabilities of an auditor, an auditor in India can be made liable under both civil law and criminal law.
Let us look at both of the liabilities in detail, now, the two actions that can be taken against an auditor under the civil law are: liability for negligence and liability for misfeasance.
Let us look at the negligence first, now an auditor is meant to perform his duty as an agent of the shareholder and other persons who have invested in the company.
He is expected to safeguard the interest of his shareholders.
He must exercise his reasonable care and due diligence in performing his duties.
If he fails to do so and in and in consequence the principal suffers any loss then he may be made liable to compensate loss cost to the company resulting from his negligence.
Now, what about liability for misfeasance? Misfeasance is a breach of duty or breach of trust under the common law and if the auditor does something wrongfully in the performance of his duty or he does not perform his duty properly in the first place resulting in a financial loss to the company he may be liable for misfeasance.
Now, let us move on to the criminal liabilities of an auditor under the Companies Act, 2013.
The first is the penalty for non-compliance.
Under section 147 of the Act, if any provisions stated under Section 139 or 146 are contravened, the company shall be punishable with a fine, which shall not be less than 25,000 but which may extend to rupees 5 lakhs.
Now, the auditor, so convicted, has to refund the remuneration received by him to the company as well as pay damages to the company or bodies or authorities any person for loss arising of any incorrect or misleading statement made by him in the audit report.
Second penalty is for failure to report a fraud.
It is the duty of the auditor under section 143 of the Companies Act (1) 2013 to report any fraud that he has reasons to believe companies officers or employees are committing against the company.
Subsection 15 lays down a fine of not less than 1 lakh which may extend to 25 lakhs, if any auditor Cost Accountant or Company Secretary does not comply with the provisions of sub section 12 regarding reporting of the fraud to the Central Government.
The third liability that is attracted under the Companies Act, 2013 by auditor by an auditor is a liability when the fraud is committed by the auditor himself.
This has been mentioned under section 145 of the Companies Act.
The company law tribunal can either suo moto or on an application made to it by the Central Government or by any other person concerned, if it is satisfied that the auditor of a company has whether directly or indirectly acted in fraudulent manner or abetted or colluded in any fraud by or in relation to the company or its director officers, it may be ordered to direct the company to change its auditor.
Once the order for changing the auditor is passed, the Act does not allowed the auditor whether individual of firm to be eligible to be reappointed as an auditor of any company any company, any company whatsoever for a period of 5 years from the date of passing of this audit report.
Now, once he has been convicted for fraud under section 140 subsection 5 there can be liability that can be attracted under Section 447 of the Companies Act, 2013.
This provision basically acts as a deterrent and preventive measure for auditors to not commit fraud.
Under it a person who has been found guilty of fraud shall be punishable with imprisonment which shall not be less than 6 months and which may extend to ten years.
He shall also be liable to be fined with an amount which shall not be less than the amount involved in the fraud but which may also extend to three times the amount involved in the fraud.
Finally, liabilities of an auditor through class action: under section 245 of the Act, any hundred or more members or deposit holders of the company or 10 percent of the total number of members or deposit holders of the company may file a class action suit to claim damages for compensation or demand any other suitable action against the auditor in the manner prescribed under the Act.
The action under section 245 can be initiated against an auditor for any improper or misleading statement of particular made in the audit report or for any fraudulent, unlawful or wrongful act or conduct.
In such an action liability will be of the order firm.
In case the audit is being conducted by a firm as well as each partner who was involved in making such an improper or misleading report.
Now, auditors form one of the pillars of corporate governance.
The auditor is responsible for verifying whether the financial statements and books of accounts exhibit a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the business.
His audit report has to be authentic and accurate.
In this module we saw, how an auditor is appointed, his qualifications, his disqualifications, tenure as well as perks and duties and liabilities which have been made under the Companies Act, 2013.
The new companies at has bought in several changes the reporting responsibilities of the auditor have under it significantly increased.
This step has been taken in order to protect the shareholder and the other investors in the company.
Therefore, auditors play a very important role in the company and protect the interest of the shareholders.
Thank you!
Hello, I am Feroze M A Khan.
I am a Professor Teaching Company Law and financing fortunately international business ,New Delhi.
Today, I will introduce you this audit and auditors under Companies Act 2013.
So besides, I will tell you the rules and regulations.
I will also tell you about integrating that regulations with the practical aspects ok.
So just you give you overview .
Chapter 10 of the Companies Act, 2013 under Section 139 to 148 deals with audit and auditors .
So, just to tell you the basic premise on which this audit and auditors are very much depending on.
So, accounts as you know accounts when you say annual accounts these are the very reliable financial statements.
Say statement of profit and loss or which you earlier we are saying profit and loss account.
Next is the balance sheet.
Next is the cash flow statement and besides other things notes to accounts and other things.
These accounts are prepared by the board of directors.
Now, these accounts when it is completed or it is accounts are completed so these have to handover to the shareholders.
Because they are going to look at how the company has manage the how that board of directors manage the company in the last 1 year.
And similarly, when the company has been manage properly.
When the company has got a profit .
So, now the company will declared dividend.
So, several sir looking forward to also the rate of dividend declared by the board of directors.
But that before the accounts are handed over though it is complete , but before it is handed over now the auditors role come into picture.
because everything when they are accounts when you say every thing is done by the company, the board of directors now it has to be waited (1:48).
It has to be verified.
It has to be audited by 1 external agency so that's why the auditor have to come into picture.
Otherwise the shareholder, they will not be relying the statements profit and the financial statement prepared by the company.
So just to ensure that the financial statement reflect to and fair view of the financial position or the net reasons of the company so the auditors play very vital role .
So, shareholders are going to realize that accounts only when it has been audit by the auditors.
Now, based on the report because when they are checking the accounts, when they are auditing the accounts.
The auditors so definitely they will come out with lot of .
The comments sometimes the comments can also be the adverse comments.
So, if it is adverse comment definitely the board of directors , they have to replay board of directors.
They have to reply to the comments so along with the comments given by the auditors plus the classifications given by the board of directors.
Now, with accounts will also be submitted together to the shareholders as per there information.
That's why in the annual report we find the beside the profit and loss account and balance sheet carry also a auditors reports.
So, now you understand that accounts are subject of Criticism the investors are looking forward to take a understanding of the profit, the company has made.
And investors, the good investors also look forward as to how the company is managing the affairs of the company.
So, how the company investing? So, ultimately future outcome also they are looking forward.
Besides the profit, they also look forward the company is going to be better and better in future to come.
So, lots of things are definitely connected.
Lots of stakeholders are connected.
It's not simply the shareholders.
It is also in the bankers, the creditors were connected even the employees, even the unions, even the government, even Income Tax Department.
What not so lot of stakeholders are connected to the company.
And so they all look forward to have a proper understanding of the accounts and finance statement.
So, they are understanding gets you know better when they see that the accounts has been audited by the auditors.
So that’s why the role of auditors comes.
if some of you can say, it, bridges the gap between the company management on one side and the several says the other side .
Now before I take you to the dipper of the rules and regulations and further integrations.
Let me tell you what is the learning outcome this module .
So, if you read this, if you watch this the video definitely you are going to relate the relevant provisions of Section 139 to 148.
So, Section 139 to Section 148 of the Companies act, 2013 to further developing and appropriate system for audit of the accounts and financial system in the company.
So, these sections are definitely going to be a kind of base.
It will create a base for developing a proper system of audit of accounts and financial system.
Similarly as we know there is a audit committee.
As you know, there is a audit committee.
In every company, the audit committee comprises the members.
Sorry, it comprises the directors of the board.
And as we also know that most of the directors, audit committee should be of the independent directors or non independent directors.
So, now audit committee is very instrumental in connecting with the auditor's and audit work .
So, audit committees are going to recommend the auditor's who are to be appointed as auditors and who are the form or the individual going to be appointed as auditors.
Similarly they are going to review also the findings of the auditors.
Even they are going to look at any loopholes or fraud or any mismanagement which is pointed out by the auditor.
So, definitely another learning outcome is there.
After watching this video , understanding the rules and regulations definitely you will be able to develop a proper understanding as to how the audit committee and the accounts department in one hand gets I mean the co-ordinate with the auditor.
So, there are 2 sides.
One is the say audit committee and accounts department the other side is audit and auditors .
So, how there is a proper conditions being maintained looking into not to forget this aspect that section 139 to 148 of the Companies Act to be complied .
So, majorly this to the outcome one is to this we can relate the sections in understanding whatever the system existing the company whether the system appropriate or not.
Second thing will also develop or understanding as to proper codeines between audit committee and accounts department.
one hand and Audit and auditors on the other hand .
Now let me quickly (6:47) talk about which are the sections, what he talks about? Section 139 deals with the appointment of auditor, section 140 talks about removal, regulations of auditor and also relates to giving up special notice.
Section 141 explains the criteria of eligibility, qualification, disqualification of auditor.
Section 142 talks about remuneration of the auditor.
Then section 143 explains power and duties.
Section 144 expects auditor not to render certain services.
Section 145 deals with provisions for signing auditor’s report.
Section 146 deals with provisions relating to auditors attending annual general meeting.
Section 147 prescribes punishments for contravention.
So the above sections from section 139 to 146 and last section is section 148 that speaks about the cost audit .
So, I will while I am talking separately each and every sections, I also tell about the analysis of that section .
So, section 139 says that subject to provision of this the companies act.
I means this chapter .
Every company sell at the first Annual General Meeting.
Appoint an individual or a form as an auditor who shall hold office from the conclusion of that meeting in the conclusion of it’s sixth annual meeting.
And thereafter till the conclusion of every 6 meeting .
And the manner and procedures of selection of auditors by the members of the company at such meeting shall be search as may be prescribed.
Similarly this section also says that no listed company or a company belonging to such class or classes of company as may be prescribed shall appoint or re-appoint.
( A) An individual as auditor for more than 1 term of 5 consecutive years and (B) An audit from as auditor for more than 2 terms of 5 consecutive years.
Now this is broadly the section talks about the appointment of the auditor but if you analysis this section definitely there are lots of finer things.
The provisions might effectely protect the nature of the auditor for 5 years.
Now coming to section 140 that talks about removal, resignation of the auditor.
So this section says that the auditor appointed under section 139 may be remove from his office before the expiry of his term only by special resolution of the company.
After opting the previous approval of the central government in that we have in the prescribed manner.
Now if you analyse this section as we understood special resolution in the companies meeting is required.
And also the approval from the central government before above reasonable opportunity of being heard should be given to the auditor.
The auditor should file report in the prescribed manner to ROC.
And the company his reasons of resignation within 30 days of resignation should be file with the ROC.
Special notice su should be required for passing reasons to not to appoint the retiring auditor.
Now, let us look at the next section that is section 141 that talks about eligibility qualification of the auditor.
Section 141 says that a person shall be eligible for appointment.
As an auditor of a company only if he is a Chartered Accountant.
Provided that the form majority of the partners practicing in India are qualified for appointment as aforesaid may be appointed at bites form name to be auditor of a company.
Section 141, further says that where a form including limited liability partnership is appointed as an auditor company, only the partners where Chartered Accountants shall be authorized to act and sign on behalf of the form.
Now let us look at the analysis of this section.
Now it is good to see that introduction of LLP that is Limited Liability Partnership as auditor and partners not having even the chartered accountant or CA degree even are allowed to work with CA .
This is similar to what has been seen as International practice.
Now, there are some terms which are being used in this section which are little subject to be better and which are suppose to be understood properly.
The terms like business relationship has given in the act as additional disqualifications request a good clarity.
Similarly other there are it is to be understood as to what constitute a business relationship whether routine business transactions at an arm's length (2:04) or even immaterial transactions.
It’s not clear as to whether a personal form an guest in providing non audit services is disqualified to be auditor of any company.
Or in that company only to unclear (2:17) services provided that doesn’t say anything else to nature of the size of the companies while resting the number of bodies to 20 companies ,.
Let us look at the next section that is 142 so that relates to remuneration of the auditor.
So, this section explain that the remuneration of the auditor of the company shall be fixed in its General Meeting or in such manner as may be determined there in.
Provided that the board may fix remuneration of the first auditor appointed by it.
This section also further says that remuneration under remuneration shall in addition to the fee payable to an auditor include the expenses.
If any inker by the auditor in connection with the audit of the company and any facility extended to him but doesn't include any revolution paid to him for any other services rendered by him at the request of the company, .
Now ,suppose you start analysing the section 142.
So, it is found that this is a big issue that why remuneration to be decided in the general meeting for all auditors except in the case of first auditor.
This is definitely a big question .
And coming to the next that is Section 144.
It says that an auditor appointed under this act shall not provide certain services.
The services are are which the auditor should not provide to the company in which he is auditing.
The accounting and bookkeeping services the internal audit, design and implementation of any financial information systems, actuary services, investment advisory services, investment banking services, rendering of outsourced financial services, management services and any other kind of services which may be prescribed.
Now, if you analysis this particular section 144 definitely people will talk about this point that there are certain non audit services which might not pose risk to the Independence.
But the way such services have been listed and define it appears that as if almost all the non audit services are risk to independence of the auditors which is dividable.
Such prescribed prohibitive practices are not at the best practices.
Now coming to Section 145 which relates to auditors to sign the auditor's report .
That explains that the person appointed as an auditor of the company sell signed the auditor's report or sign or certify any another document of the company in accordance with the provisions of these section.
And the qualifications, the observations comments of analyses transactions or mattress which have any adverse effect on the functioning of the company mentioned in the auditor's report shall be read before the company in the general meeting.
And shall be open to inspection by the members of the company .
This is very good I mean development that whatever the auditors comment that has to be read in the meeting.
So earlier the it was being only circulated .
now it has been definitely emphasize that the report should be read in the meeting.
So any adverse coming with the auditors with the functioning of the company shall be read in the of the general meeting for information of all the members this a good development.
Now coming to Section 146, which says that all notices of and other communication relating to any General Meeting shall be forwarded to the auditor of the company .
And the auditor shall unless otherwise exempted by the company at and either by himself or through his authorize representative who shall also be qualified to an auditor .
Surely, it will make the shareholder happy.
So I personally believe that this is a good development .
And this is going to really improve the ethical fabric of the company.
Now section 147 that talks about the punishment for contravening the afore said sections which what we discuss.
Now section 147 explains that if any of the provisions of Section 139 to 146 if these sections are not complied the company shall be punishable with fine which shall not be less than 25000 rupees.
But which may extend to be 5 lacks of rupees.
And every officer of the company which in default shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 1 year or with fine which shall not less than 10000 rupees.
But which may extend to be 100000 rupees or with both.
Now section 147 further says about the response of the auditor that even auditor of a company contravenes any of the provisions of Section 139 or section 143 or section 144 or 145, the auditor shall be punishable with fine which shall not be less than 25000 rupees.
But which may extend to 5,00,000 rupees.
1 interesting difference between the earlier companies act 1956 and the new Companies Act 2013 definitely as it is understood it is experience that the amount of punishment or the severity it has increase.
Perhaps it has going to really I mean curtail the wrong practices by the both the company and also the auditor.
Now there are certain terms which are definitely properly understood.
The terms like intention to receive any other persons Consultant or interested in the company.
So, these terms are very much confusing those even the words like in proper or misleading statement of particulars.
Even further likely act so these terms are the very much confusing.
Similarly so more terms are wrongful act or conductor that appears very much unclear (10:26) and would create difficulties in interpretation.
Given the unlimited liability inflecting open the auditor, the same year result in adverse impact and may give rise to disputes and conflicts.
There can be few situations when the form can be held liable for the fault of partner which is not at per the better international practices.
The provisions of the class action by the minority shareholders would bring even auditor per into per view besides you know advisors and experts against sooms action can be initiated.
Experts believe that this provision might be misused .
Now if you look at the analyses of these section definitely this section section 147 needs to be properly understood with regard to of lot of terms which are being used.
This is really needs to be properly understood .
Similarly sometimes if the auditor can go against the spirit and may report also certain very small small minor things which is again going to create confusion.
So as we understand lot of things are going to further come because of you know the elaboration has not been made in new active in.
#Course Name: Corporate LawHello dear students!
I am Anil Kumar Rai, Professor at National Law University, Delhi.
I will be dealing with the Governance Structure of Companies and this module I will briefly deal with that what are the important aspects of the governance structure with regard to the governance structure of the companies.
So when we look to the governance structure of the companies two important aspects have to be taken into account.
One is that there is a divergence in ownership of an asset and control over it and the second aspect is that legal personality is being imputed to an artificial entity.
Divergence, Now, we have to understand that whenever there is a divergence and ownership of an asset and control over it then duties will have to be imputed on the person who is in control of the asset.
Law implies that the person who is in control over the asset has owes certain duties to the person who really owns the asset in law or in equity.
So, let us take for example, the property which is held in trust, the trustee who is in control of the asset owes duties to the beneficial owner of that particular asset.
Similarly, in the law of agency the agent concerned owes duty to his principal.
In a partnership, the person concerned though its the entire partnership which is in control of the asset .
But if a partner is dealing on behalf of the asset on behalf of the partnership the asset then the concerned partner will in that particular circumstance has a certain duty to the rest of the partners.
Now, the duties can be increased or decreased by contract .
So, you can increase the duty you can decrease the duty.
Many times when the duties are provided whatever is imputed by law this is implied part of the relationship between the parties.
But, by contract duties can be reduced and in many circumstances the duties are reduced to such an extent by contract that the party concerned virtually has no duty.
This might be of some concern in certain circumstances and we will come to it later on.
Now, the second aspect which we have to take into account is that legal personality when it is given to an artificial entity.
The statute granting that particular personality will provide for rules of ascription.
The rules are a necessary part of granting of a personality because here we are dealing with an artificial entity.
When we are dealing with an artificial entity there has to be something which will say that in what circumstances the artificial entity has entered into a contract.
In what circumstances it is this it can a certain decision because unless we have rules of ascription then we will not be certain that whether the entity concern has taken a decision or it has not taken a decision or it has entered into a contract or it has not entered into a contract because whatever is unfavorable to it those who are benefiting from that entity will back out from it.
Now, we have different circumstances by which a personality can be created.
One particular circumstance is what personality is created by law.
The statute creates a personality examples of this are where weak personalities, local bodies, universities, statutory corporations.
Now, when the personal this personalities are created by the statute the statute will provide which organs of that particular body will take a decision ,which organs of that particular body will take a decision in a particular field.
What shall be the composition of the different organs? What shall be the powers of those different organs? the conflict between different organs of that legal person shall be resolved.
The extent of their powers.
Now, in another way it can also provide; first, these are the broad norms which the statute lay down, then it can lay down not just the broad norms but it will also take into account the fact that the statute cannot anticipate all the circumstances and it will not be appropriate for the statue to cover everything in detail.
So, delegated legislation can be provided for in those circumstances and statue will lay down the norms for delegated legislation.
#Course Name: Corporate LawNow, when an artificial person comes into existence under statute, like: cooperates and companies we have to understand that this is a situation which is different from the first situation which I refer to earlier. in the first situation which are referred to earlier, the purpose for which the concerned statutory corporation or body came into existence was a defined purpose.
Here, the purpose will never be a defined purpose.
It can be many purposes all of which can never be enumerated in the statue concern.
Second thing is that there are the members or can be specified it can be laid down in greater detail how the concerned body can be governed.
This is a situation which is different there has to be a certain degree of flexibility which has to be given in this situation rather than laying down in detail how these bodies can, how these artificial persons should govern them but themselves.
But, something has to be specified by the statute.
First of all it has to specify the provisions it has to specify in what situations recognition should be given to the board, the concerned artificial entity.
So, it will lay down, how the artificial and what should be satisfied when the artificial entity comes into existence.
There has to be specified in with the great degree of detail and certainty.
Second it has to provide for oversight by the authorities when it has laid down the situations when the in which the artificial entity comes into existence.
It has also to look specified for oversight by the authorities.
Statutory corporation is a different thing compared in that particular situation.
It is answerable to the government, it is answerable to the law Codes for the performance of its duties.
But here, most of the times the concerned Cooperative or the company is not answerable to the government, it's not answerable to the Law Codes.
It has a purpose purpose it has to fulfill and it is answerable only to the man powers.
The third of type of a situation which this statute has to provide for is it has to recognize the different interest which are there in that particular entity and how to reconcile the different interests or a mechanism by which the different interest should be reconciled.
Now, what are the main interests which have to be reconciled in a company? The first interest which needs to be reconciled in a company is that of the shareholders vis-a-vis the creditors.
The shareholders are the risk takers.
The creditors have to be paid-back.
But the creditors would have greater interest in the paying back of that their money then the shareholders have ,who have got a limited liability if the company fails.
The second type of interest which has to be reconciled.
The second type of situation where the recognition of interest has to be done is where one class of interest of one class of shareholders vis-a-vis the interest of another class of shareholders.
The different classes of shareholders will have interest which clash with each other and the company has to reconcile those interest.
the different class of shareholders will not be only with regard to shareholders which have one type of rights but shareholders who because of their situation in that particular company have a different by themselves are a different class.
When they derived right through the articles of association there was an opportunity which was provided to them to protect their rights and many a times in the private company ,the shareholder does have a role in the management and since it has a role in the management, he can look into that particular companies management more carefully than a normal person.
Sorry! Since, the shareholder has a role in the management he is in the know what the company is doing and how it will affect his interests.
On the other hand we take into account a listed public company.
Listed public company is at the other end of the spectrum.
The shareholder has not negotiated the articles of association in a listed public company.
Since, he has not negotiated the articles of association usually in a listed public company, the shareholder concern does not have an opportunity to take measures to protect his rights from that of of the majority.
He does not have a role in the management so there is a minimum knowledge which he has how the companies is working and how it will affect his interest? Now, these two factors: the fact you have that in a private company the shareholder has the role in the management.
While in a list listed public company the shareholder does not have a management role has not had taken any measures so as to control so as to protect his own rights.
Therefore, the scope of rights which are being given to a shareholder in a private limited company and in a listed public company will be different.
In a private limited company the statute takes into account that the shareholder has an opportunity to protect his natures.
While in a listed public company that particular opportunity is usually not available since it is usually not available the statute as to step-in and provide for it.
Now, in a similar way in, we have to look into the distinction between the different class of the rights of a different class of shareholders.
In a public company you have 2 classes of shareholders and equity and preference shareholders.
Of course there can be classes within the preference shareholder, different classes of preference shareholder but they are a class by themselves.
Now, between the equity and preference shareholder we have to take into account that the preference shareholder has got a preferential right of dividend, secondly he has also that got a preferential right of return of capital.
And since his capital is not at risk therefore it is the equity shareholder who ought to be given a greater say in the affairs of the company than the preference shareholder because the equity shareholder takes the maximum risk in the success or failure of the company.
Now, it is an artificial person and it has to act through the natural person.
Now, can it at through the natural person that is the shareholder.
Theoretically, there is no prohibition in doing it but then the advantage of having a company is taken away.
One of the purposes of having a company is that the shareholder can be separated from the date today, affairs of the company and its management can be given to a professional body which will manage the day to day affairs of the company.
The so in this way it the company is different from the partnership.
Now, the company has to act through a natural person.
Who will have been charged of the day today affairs of that particular company? That particular body which is in charge of the day-to-day affairs of the company are the directors and the body of directors is the board of directors.
They are selected by the shareholders as per the Companies Act and articles of association.
Now, though they have been selected by the shareholders they are represent the company and not the shareholders.
This is an important distinction which we have to take into account that they represent the interest of the company and not of the shareholders.
The implications of this particular distinction are that in certain circumstances for the interest of the company they can take decisions which might not be in the interest of the shareholders as such.
Now, what is the relationship between the shareholders the board of directors and the company? The shareholders and the board of directors are two organs of the company.
They speak for the company and they act for the company.
The distributions of powers are dependent upon the Companies Act and articles of association.
First, let us look into what are the powers which are vested in the shareholders? What are their rights and of the shareholders? That can be three sets of rights which are vested in the shareholders.
One it is provided to them by the Companies Act.
Second set is that which has been reserved for them by the articles of association.
The third side relates to those with the shareholders by voting have reserved from themselves.
The reason is obvious.
The shareholder never had the opportunity to provide for rights to himself in articles of association to protect himself from the majority decision.
Rights which have been reserved for the shareholders will relate to different types of situations.
So, first type is where it relate to the oversight by the shareholder of the Board.
So, approving the accounts of the company deciding of the auditors of the company.
These are the methods by which the shareholder overseas the board of directors.
What it is doing? How it is affecting its interests? So, these rights have to be reserved in favor of the shareholders.
Second type of situation laid to where there can be a conflict of interest between the board and the interest of the company.
So, oversight has to be given to the shareholder in such situation.
So, in such situations the shareholder will have to decide whether it .
second type of a situation related to where there might be a conflict of interest between that of the company and that of the board of directors that for example; the related party transactions.
In related party transactions the shareholder has to be given an opportunity to decide whether the transaction has to be entered into or not because the decision of the board cannot be relied upon.
The third type of a situation where the shareholder has to be given power is leads to where he has to be made aware of the nature of risk and its implications.
Take for example; the sale of an undertaking.
Merger of a company with another company, these are situations which will have implications on the value of the share and it has a bearing on the risk with the company which the undertaking will be subject to.
Then, there are rights and powers which are reserved by the shareholders for themselves in the articles of association of the company.
Now, the shareholders may reserve additional decision making powers for themselves in the articles of association.
They might also while reserving for rights for themselves provide for stiffer norms by which one can say that the shareholders have approved a particular action and they might provide also for special powers to one of the shareholders or a body of the shareholders.
As far as the powers which are given to the board are concerned those powers my proof certain sets of powers will flow from the Companies Act.
The reason why certain sets of powers will flow from the Companies Act is because the Companies Act recognises that in certain situations the duties of the board might be in conflict with the interest of the shareholders.
So, in a situation where the duties of the board matter in conflict with the interest of the shareholders the powers have to be given to the board.
So that they override the shareholders in that situation then powers might be given to the board or to a committee of the board by the articles of association of the company.
And lastly, shareholders might delegate certain powers to the board by voting.
Now, powers given to the board by articles, as we know the articles of association is a contractual document among the shareholders.
Since, it’s a contractual document among the shareholders.
Therefore what the powers which have been given to the board are something which is binding not only just upon the board but it is binding upon the shareholders too.
The shareholders cannot take away from the board of directors that which has been given by them to it without amending the articles even though the shareholders as a body might differ from the board by majority large enough to amend the articles.
But, till they have amended the articles it is the board which shell exercise that particular power.
Now, also one have factor we have to take into account that shareholder does not mean just the majority of the shareholders.
It means all the shareholders and some of the shareholders might differ from the decision of the majority.
Also certain rights might be given to the minority shareholders and those rights cannot be taken away by the majority of the shareholders.
So, if the board of directors decision is subject to the view of one particular shareholder, the concerned if one board of directors view is subject to so, if the board of directors decision is subject to the view of one director nominated by a particular shareholder.
It cannot be that the shareholders as a body can override that particular view of the board of directors because this is a right which has been given to a particular shareholder.
The majority if at the initial stage has reserve the right for one individual shareholder or his or one individual shareholder or a director nominated by him then the majority cannot take it away without amending the articles.
Another aspect which we have to also to take into account is that if the power has been given to the board of directors then that another aspect which we have to take into account that is that the articles of association is a public document.
The public is aware of the decision making structure of the company through this particular document.
So, if the shareholders seek to impose their view upon the view of the board of directors then there would be confusion in the public concern.
Now, decision making by the shareholders is usually by an Annual General Meeting or an Extraordinary General Meeting.
Annual General Meeting has to be as the word itself suggests has to be called annually and it will deal with the housekeeping functions like – approval of accounts, etc.
Extraordinary General Meeting is something as the very name suggests is something which will be called in extraordinary circumstances.
It is either the board of directors, the Tribunal or a certain percentage of the members, who will request the board of directors to call for a meeting and the board of directors then will call for that particular meeting.
As per the Companies Act it is 10 percent of the members who can call for an Extraordinary General Meeting.
What is a meeting? Meeting has two elements.
First is, exchange of views amongst the members and determination of majority amongst the members.
For an exchange of views there has to be for exchange of views the members have to be told insufficient detail all the aspects of a particular case and they have to be told sufficiently in advance for them to be able to form the minimum number of members which will be required for a meeting to occur will be two because there cannot be an exchange of you and the determination of majority and unless there are two members who are present.
So, if it is not a single person company for a meeting the minimum quorum requirement will be two.
But the quorum requirements will go up as the number of members of a company increase under Companies Act depending upon the number of members of a company the quorum requirements increase.
Quorum requirements can also be provided for in the articles of association of the company.
It can provide for more stringent quorum requirements then what it is provided for in the Companies Act.
Now, if the members meet and they are in agreement with a particular action which has to be taken or particular step which has to be resolved then they will pass a resolution.
The resolution can be passed by show of hands or by voting.
Voting can be either physical or in case of public limited companies it can also be by postal ballot.
The postal ballot becomes necessary because many times the the people who take a decision in a company are the minority.
It gives the majority, a view into the decision making because physical presence is usually very difficult for most of the people.
Value of vote which is caste will be dependent upon whether it's a public company or it is a private company.
In a public company each equity share will have the same vote as another equity share.
But in a private company different shares can have different weight as far as their voting rights goes.
It can be possible that one share as far is voting has got the twice the value as another share or it can be any multiple which we can think of.
Now, the resolution which is passed by the company can be a general resolution or a specialist resolution.
A general resolution is where an ordinary majority is required but in certain situations special resolution might be required.
The Companies Act provides for certain situations where special resolution is required.
Generally, they can be classified in three types: first is that which relate to the contractual relationship among the shareholders.
Articles of association and memorandum of association should be amended only if three fourth of the majority of the shareholders present and voting vote for it.
Second type of his situation laids to those which have the potential to affect the shareholder value, so in cases where at new shares have to be issued in a public limited company in the case of merger of companies, sale of an undertaking or the company making investment above a particular limit or giving guarantees extra above a particular limit of the share of shareholders funds should have the backing of three fourth of the majority of shareholders.
For the actions which have which have to be reserved for the shareholder but many times the board might have over stepped into what was reserved by the shareholders for themselves? In such a situations the shareholders also can ratify the actions of the board.
Provided it was within their powers to ratify.
One question which usually arises is – is a formal resolution always necessary for us to know that whether the whether the company has decided on a particular course of action? It’s not so but it's not so only if we we but it’s not so only if we can say with a certainty that there was an informal unanimous agreement among the shareholders and this informal unanimous agreement amongst all the shareholders should be evidenced by conduct by the shareholders.
Normally, for the passage of a resolution it is the equity shareholders who vote.
It’s their vote which is taken into account but we have to take into account that preference shareholders are excluded from voting only because that they are not at risk.
It means that the company is in financial trouble.
Once the company is in financial trouble then it's not the equity shareholders who are also interested in it, it’s also the creditors and the preference shareholders.
The creditors in any way are protected by statue.
In a financially troubled company the preference shareholders will lose and lose as much as the equity shareholders.
Another situation which we have to take into account is that where it concerns the rights and duties of a class of securities.
The members of that where it concerns the rights and duties of a class of securities it is the owners of those securities who should vote on it.
So, where it relates to the rights and duties of a class of securities as resolution has to be passed by three fourth holders of that particular class of securities and it affects any other class of securities then that resolution also has to be passed by the affected class of securities.
let us come to delisting of securities.
When we say we have listed our securities ,we have entered into an agreement with this stock exchange.
And the stock exchange will provide the facility for trading of securities on the stock exchange.
When we say delist that means now we are cancelling this agreement of listing.
So that further after that agreement is cancelled no trading facility will be provided to the those particular securities which have been delisted.
delisting can be of 2 types.
It can be a voluntary delisting and compulsory delisting.
And voluntary delisting ,when the company itself makes an application for the delisting of the securities then it is voluntary delisting.
And if it is compulsory delisting , then the stock exchange takes a decision for delisting of the securities.
voluntary is dependent upon the need of the company.
The reasons are with the company.
Compulsory delisting, the reasons are given by the delisting regulations.
And these are the reasons for which the stock exchange can go ahead with the delisting of the securities.
And there is a requirement of continuous listing under rule 19 A of the companies of SCR regulations.
And 1 has to understand over here that when it is delisting it does not mean that it is buyback of securities.
Buyback of securities is done by the company.
But in the case of delisting of securities, promoters buy these securities .
that is why the promoters they have to give their money, use their money for delisting of securities.
And delisting means now the securities will not be available in the trading platform.
The shareholders may want to exit the company because they had invested in the company to earn certain returns through the trading of the securities.
And if the trading is not possible on nationwide terminals then obviously they may would like to exit the company.
Over here 1 has to make understand that there is a difference between delisting and buy back of securities.
Let us understand about conditions of delisting.
Delisting is not permitted in certain cases.
For example, if it is pursuant to buy back of equity shares , if the company has got back securities they cannot be delisted.
They have to be extinguished as per the provisions of the Companies Act applicable to buy back of securities.
Then if a company makes the preferential allotment of securities then it cannot go ahead with the listing of those securities.
Then if securities are listed at least for a period of 3 years before that they cannot be delisted.
a minimum listing should be there for 3 years before the company goes and with the delisting of securities.
And if any convertible instruments are outstanding at the time of the delisting.
And these convertible instruments, they are convertible into the same type of securities which are proposed to be delisted then the company should not go head or rather company cannot go head with the delisting of these securities.
these are the 4 conditions or exemptions where the delisting is not possible.
And the promoters as i discussed earlier they cannot use the funds of the company for the purposes of the delisting.
And in order to provide exit opportunity to the shareholders, they have to use their own funds.
And promoters or any other person is restricted.
They are not allowed to employ any device or artifice or scheme or make any kind of transaction which operates as fraud on the shareholders.
Or which is fraudulent, manipulative or deceptive.
These are 2 conditions which the promoters have to keep in mind.
Let us understand what is voluntary delisting? As I told you, that the company itself decides to volunteer delist its securities.
The reasons can be like company does not want to further go ahead with the statutory compliance, the company has been losing on the trading of securities, company has suspended its business, company has become a sick company, it is restructuring itself, it is going at reorganization of it’s share capital.
Then the company may go ahead with voluntary delisting.
Obviously the regulations cannot provide the reasons for the delisting but if the delisting has to be done the procedure is provided by the regulation.
What is exit opportunity and when it has to be given? Exit opportunity is given to the shareholders when the securities, when those are shares are being delisted from the securities.
And they are delisted from the nationwide terminals like NSE or BSE.
If they are available on regional terminal but not on the nation wide terminal, then the promoters they have to give this exit opportunity to the shareholder.
That since from now onwards after the delisting trading facility will not be available.
In case you want to take back your money, we can pay you and we can take back your shares.
And the shares are taken back or bought back by the promoters for the shake of delisting.
exit opportunity is the opportunity given to the shareholders to exit the company.
And sell their shares back to the promoters of the company.
exit opportunity is necessary only when the nationwide trading facility is not available otherwise it is not compulsory for a company to give exit opportunities.
And for delisting also the promoters, they have to taken in principle approval from the stock exchange.
And for this purpose ,the reverse book building process supplies over here.
And What is Reverse book building? The promoters, they come up with offer of delisting and they ask the shareholders of the company that at what price they are willing to sell their securities to the promoters of the company.
a prices fixed and then a final price is fixed on the basis of the revese book building process.
On the basis of the floor price multiplied by number of securities the similar securities outstanding in the market that amount is calculated.
And the promoter has to keep that amount in the escrow account which will be used for the purposes of paying back at the time of exit opportunity to the shareholders.
The final price is decided on the basis of the reverse book building.
When the book closes, final price is decided.
Whatever is the balance required promoter has to provide the deficiency of the amount in the escrow account.
Let us now understand what is compulsory delisting.
Compulsory delisting is done by the stock exchanges.
The reasons are given under the regulation.
The first reason is that the company has incurred losses for preceding 3 consecutive years and has a negative network.
Second, there has been a suspension of trading in securities for more than 6 months.
Third, there has been infrequent trading of securities during the preceding last 3 years.
this is the fourth ground.
Fifth ground is that the addresses of the company or any of its promoters or directors are not known or the false addresses are given or the company has changed its registered office without information to the stock exchange.
And the company's public shareholding has gone below the minimum level which is required and company has not been able to raise it within the prescribed time limit.
And these are the grounds on the basis of which the compulsory delisting can be ordered by any stock exchange.
Obviously, an opportunity of hearing has to be given to the stock exchange before finalizing the decision on this.
And the decision of delisting is to be taken by a panel which is constituted by the stock exchange as it is prescribed under the regulations.
And public announcement of the delisting has to be made by the company.
And the price of the securities at which the exit opportunity will be given to the shareholders, that price has to be decided by the independent valuer.
And who will be deciding upon the determining the fair value of the delisted equity shares.
there are certain special provisions.
I will read these special provisions for you.
In the case of a small company having a paid up capital of up to 1 crore with no trading of its equity shares in 1year, immediately preceding the date of the decision of delisting.
Or the company has 300 or less number of public shareholders and the paid up value of shares held by them is less than 1 crore.
The company is not required to follow the procedure given for exit opportunities.
these are the special provisions for the delisting of securities.
Let us now take an example of Trichy Distilleries and Chemicals Limited.
This case was decided in 2011.
in this case the issue was that whether 90% of the shareholders in number or shareholders holding 90% of the public shareholding in value irrespective of their number should consent for the delisting proposal.
Whether they should be shareholders 90 in numbers or shareholders irrespective of their number.
If they are holding 90% of the shareholding of the company, they should be entitled to vote for the delisting proposal.
In this case the company was able to get consent of more than 90% of the shareholders in value but the number of shareholders giving consent did not add up to 90% of the public shareholder.
the Madras Stock Exchange refused to go head with delisting.
To approve the delisting by the company.
it was decided later on when the case went into dispute that if we go by the provisions of the companies act which says that 1 share is equal to one vote.
This means that it would lead to absurdities if the consent of 90% public shareholders in value was not accepted.
this was a case which was decided by the in the year 2011 over here there have been number of statements which have been made publicly in the newspapers now a days about delisting of regulations.
And there should be review of the delisting regulations because some of the companies are finding the process to be very cumbersome and lot of efforts have to be made by the company.
review of the delisting regulations has been proposed.
And the SEBI also wants to restrict the delisting procedures with the possibilities of manipulation in the case of delisting is avoided because delisting is totally in the hands of the promoters of the companies.
In order to have any kind of tacit understanding between promoters and if you share holders where the price manipulation of the securities can be The SEBI is under reviewing under this review of delisting regulations.
And the major changes which are being discussed are that we should reduce the time period of delisting which is given for 250 days because this is a too long a period because there are chances of price manipulations of this stock.
There can be a manipulations of the prices by the non-promoter group.
There is suspension of trading after the announcement of delisting so 250 days are a long period for that.
And some times demand of the securities is also less.
The Discussion paper was proposed by SEBI for reviewing delisting regulations.
They are working on this and although the revised regulations have not been imposed so far .
They have not been enforce so far.
of the under the review or the discussion paper, the process of reverse book building the time which is taken and informal arrangements which have to be made the procedure should be made a little simple for the companies for delisting of securities.
all these issues are under discussion with the SEBI.
Let us now take few examples of a delisting.
Then the first public announcement was made on May 16, 2014 and it was in respect of the proposed acquisition and voluntary delisting of fully paid up equity shares of the company from the Bombay Stock exchange, Madhya Pradesh stock exchange and NSC .
And later of offer was issued on may 20th to the shareholders for inviting bids from all the public shareholders.
And post offer public announcement was made on June 26.
you see that first of all an announcement is made, public announcement is made and offer letter is sent to the prospective shareholders.
Then the second public announcement is also made after the book building process is complete.
Then in another case, in the case of Piramal Glass Limited, public shareholders they were informed through the public announcement on July 22nd 2014 by Kotak Mahindra capital company limited.
On behalf of Shri Hari Trust which acted through its corporate trusty PEL Management Services Private Limited about the proposed acquisition and voluntary delisting of fully paid up equity shares of rupees 10 Each of the company vide public announcement which was made on April 25th 2014.
Acquirer head fixed the exit price of rupees 140 Per share which was calculated by the reverse book building process as we discussed.
All shareholders who tendered their shares through valid bids at or below the final price they were paid accordingly.
Promoters group shareholding increase to 90.85% after the acquisition.
And the company applied for delisting to NSE and BSE.
And the company had made an offer to residual shareholders to tender their shares at the same terms and conditions.
Over here you see that promoter shareholding increase to 90.85% after this delisting.
And we know that promoters cannot have more than 75% of the shareholdings.
After delisting they have again to reduce their shareholding to meet the norms.
While riding this module certain changes were proposed in the delisting regulations by amendment of 2015 and in these amendments, I will consider only the major amendments which have been proposed in these regulation.
First amendment which is very important is to know is what are the conditions for delisting? 1 more condition has been added for delisting.
And the regulations says the delisting is not permitted pursuant to buy back of equity shares or a preferential allotment made by a company or unless the specified securities have been listed for a period of 3 years on the stock exchange.
If any convertible instrument issued by the company are outstanding and they are convertible into same class of equity shares that are sought to be listed.
The new condition which has been added is that the delisting is not permitted, if any entity belonging to promoter or promoter group has sold equity shares of the company during a period of 6 months prior to the date of board meeting approving the delisting proposal.
Another change which has been made is about the exit opportunity and the procedure for the exit opportunities.
where in the case of voluntary delisting exit opportunities required to be given.
This proposal has to be approved by the board of directors of the company.
And public notice should be given and the application to the concerned recognized stock exchange for delisting of equity shares should also be given.
The board of directors has to approve and they have to make a disclosure to the concerned recognized stock exchange.
Appoint a merchant banker to carry out the due diligence process.
And obtain trading details of shares of the company of top 20 shareholders of the company for a period of 2 years prior to the date of the board meeting when they are working on approval or the approval of the resolution for the proposal of delisting.
Then the board has to certify that the company is in compliance with the applicable provisions of securities, laws and conditions for delisting.
As well as the delisting is in the interest of the shareholders of the company.
these are 3 changes which are made in the case of voluntary delisting where exit opportunities required to be given.
Another major change is about when an offer is deemed to be successful.
in 2009 regulations ,an offer was deemed to be successful.
If post offer is shareholding of the promoter taken together with the shares accepted through eligible bits at the final price reaches the higher of 90% of the total issued shares of that class excluding the shares which are held by a custodian.
And against which depository receipts have been issued overseas.
Or the aggregate percentage of the pre offer promoter shareholding and 50% of the offer size.
so the shares will be accepted only when the final price reaches the higher of the 2.
In 2015, amendment an offer shall be deemed to be successful only if the post of a promoter shareholding taken together which share accepted through eligible bids at the final price richest 90% of the total issued shares of that class.
And at least 25% of public shareholders holding shares in the Deemed mode as on the date of the board meeting have participated in the book building process.
you see that these conditions now they have been made more strict depending upon the promoter shareholding as well as the participation of the public share holders in the delisting process.
these are the changes which are proposed by the new amendment which is made in 2015.
Good morning I am Dr.Harpreet Kaur Professor of law at National Law University Delhi.
Today I will be dealing with corporate borrowings and investments, which will give an inside to the students as to what are corporate borrowings? What do we mean by corporate borrowings and how investments are done by the companies? I would be referring only to the provisions of the Companies Act for this purpose.
I will not be going into the types of borrowings which are governed by RBI, so I will be focusing only on the Companies Act 2013 provisions.
Now, 2013 act has made certain changes in the procedure, how a company can go ahead with the investment.
So we will take into account all these changes which are made by the Companies Act 2013.
Now first of all over here it necessary for us to understand that a company which is into a trading business or which is conducting a business has to , meet its requirements either through the share capital or it can also raise a debt.
Now a trading company has an implied power to borrow, whereas a company which is not into trading activities does not have this implied power so that there should be specific power given in the memorandum of association of the company that it has the power to borrow money for the purposes of the company.
Now if a company is collecting debt from the public that it has to do it through the issue of debt securities and when these are debt securities again the debt securities have to be listed and all the formalities relating to listing of debt securities have to be complied with by the company.
A company can also go ahead with long term loans from the financial institutions and commercial banks and in order to meet the short term needs of the finance the company is generally used method like a trade credit factoring, discounting of bills of exchange, bank overdrafts and cash credit.
ECBs are also methods which can be used by the companies for borrowing, and they are primarily cross-border debts which are raised by the company’s, Indian companies from overseas lenders with a weighted average maturity period of not less than 3 years and such borrowings are governed by RBI regulations and Foreign Exchange Management Act of 1999.
Now, it is a necessary for us to understand that a company has to make a financial analysis and it has to decide about the method of a fundraising, whether it should go with the raising of share capital, whether it should go with the borrowings, what is the interest rate at which the borrowings are applicable whether the lenders are available in the market or not, what is the investors’ confidence on its debt securities and what are the differential interest rates from the banks and the bonds, all this analysis has to be done by the company before it decides to go ahead with raising of debts through the issue of debt securities.
And investments they are also provided by the Companies Act of 2013.
So let's take the current borrowings, how many borrowings have been done by the Indian companies.
So in 2013 Indian companies they raise around 3.10 crore rupees through the borrowing and they preferred to meet, the companies preferred to meet their financial needs for the debt rather than through the issue of securities in the form of initial or further public offering and the companies they preferred the private placement of bonds and non-convertible debentures to meet their need.
Now this is the very important aspect over here, that companies were not sure whether the investors are willing to invest as a shareholders in the form of IPU or FPOs with them.
And they were able to find lenders of money which were, who were there willing to lend money to them and again when the companies decided to have debt raised from the lenders, they also preferred to go for private placement of bonds rather than the issue of public issue of debt securities.
And they also preferred for non convertible debentures that means these differences are not convertible into shares later on.
So, this indicates the sentiment of the of the market and on the basis of this, the companies they make their choices, what method they should adopt for borrowing debt from the market.
And so within the debt market are the figures are like this: If company raised about to 2.
65 lakh crores with the debt placement route 23,745 crore through non convertible debentures and 19,650 crores with the public issue of debt securities.
So over here we see that a maximum is through the debt placement route.
The second category is non-convertible debentures and third is issue of a debt securities.
Now let us understand what is ultra vires borrowing? Ultra vires means beyond the powers of the company.
So anything which is done beyond the powers of the company becomes ultra-vires and it is ultra vires borrowing, that means the borrowing has been beyond the powers of the company.
So any borrowing which is neither expressly nor impliedly is permitted that will be termed as ultra vires borrowing because it is beyond the powers of the company.
Now the question arises what are the rights of the person whose loan has become ultra vires.
Does he have any legal debt against the company or any equitable debt against the company? No he does not have such any right against the company, but he can get an injunction to restrain the company from using the money which has been lent by him, if the company has so far not used this company.
So this remedy he can, this relief he can take in the form of injunction, if he knows he comes to know that the money has not been used by the company.
Then if his money has been used by the company to pay off any lawful debt then also he can subrogate to the position of the lawful creditor of the company and then his money can be repaid by the company to such an extent he will have the right of recovery from the of the money from the company which has been lent by him to the company.
And at the third point, if he can identify and trace his loan in the original form in the original form or the products which have been brought up by the company and which are there in the position of the company, he can claim this money or he can also claim for the products from the company.
But if his money gets mixed up with the capital of the company, he loses all such rights of, when his borrowing has become ultra vires the company.
Now let us understand what is regular borrowing or what is authorized borrowing.
So any borrowing which is exercise which is done by the board of directors of the company that will become the regular borrowing.
And under section 179 of the Companies Act 2013 the board of directors of a company, they have the power to borrow money for the purposes of the company.
Now the ratios have been fixed over here.
Certain restrictions have been placed by this by section 180 it says that where the money borrowed together with the money which is already borrowed by the company will exceed aggregate of its paid-up share capital and free reserves, apart from the temporary loans which are obtained by the company from the company's bankers in the ordinary course of the business.
It can borrow money with consent of the company by a special resolution.
So this has to be kept in mind that where the money exceeds that the new loan exceeds the total aggregate of the paid-up capital plus free reserves and the special resolution of the company has to be followed has to be passed for the for further borrowing.
And what are temporary loans? The temporary loans are loans which are repayable on demand or within 6 months from the date of the loan for example short term loans, cash credit arrangements, discounting of bills and the issue of other short term loans of a seasonal character and they do not include loans which are raised for the purpose of financial expenditure of a capital nature.
So this is in brief about the regular borrowings of the company.
Now there are certain exceptions to section 186.
The exceptions says that they are not, these provisions are not applicable to a loan made or guarantee given or a security provided by a banking insurance or housing finance company in the ordinary course of its business or a company which is engaged in the financing of companies are providing infrastructural facilities because this is the ordinary business of such type of companies.
It does not apply to any acquisition made by non banking financial company, register under RBI and whose principal business acquisition of securities and exemption will be available only for its investment and learning activities and also by to any acquisition which is made by a company whose principal business is the acquisition of securities or it will also not apply to any acquisition of shares which are allotted under section 62 of the Companies Act 2013.
So these are certain exceptions which are given under the section.
Let us now understand section 187 of the Companies Act 2013, which is about investment of companies to be held in the names of the companies.
And this is perfectly acceptable proposition that all the investment done by the company should be in the names of the companies only because these are the investments of the companies only in the case of holding and subsidiary relationship, whereas holding companies, holding shares in the subsidiary company then the company can have shares in the names of its normally because the minimum shareholding number of the shareholders have to be maintained.
And I hope you understand that what is meant by holding and subsidiary relationship this is a relationship between two companies where one company is exercising control over the other company by means of either having more than 251 % of the shareholding in the other company or by controlling composition of board of directors of the other company.
So, the relationship of holding and subsidiary company comes into being, also if a one subsidiary company or another company is another company.
For example if S is subsidiary of A and A becomes a subsidiary of H then both A and S will become the subsidiaries of H.
So these are three methods, either through the method of the composition of the board of director or through the share maximum 51% of the shareholding of the company or through the third means, these are the three means through which the three methods through which a company can have a holding subsidiary apart from this a company for the purposes of collection of dividend of the interest may hold its securities or or investments with SBI or any other scheduled commercial bank for the purposes of facilitating the collection of dividend and the interest.
And it can also transfer it to the SBI or any scheduled commercial bank.
It can hold it in the name of the SBI or any other scheduled bank but where after the transfer in it if within 6 months the transaction is not completed then the retransfer of the securities are done in the name of the company itself.
This has to be kept into mind and also the companies can also transfer their securities for the repayment of the loan as a security to any other person and then can get it back to them in their own names when they have re-paid the loan.
So these documents were the instruments can be used by the company as a security for the loan also they can also be transferred to SBI or other scheduled commercial bank for the purposes of collection of dividend and the interest.
And the company has to maintain a register for it, otherwise it becomes very difficult for a company to know how many investment it has made and what investment are in the name of any other scheduled commercial bank or they are given as a security to any other person.
So a proper register has to be maintained by a company under section 187 in order to give a clear picture about the investments done by the company.
Let us now take certain examples first example which I will take is of Tata steel.
This is about issue of non convertible debentures.
So , we understand what are debentures, when we say they are non-convertible that means they cannot be converted into shares later on.
So they have to be redeemed.
That means the repayment has to be made by the company to the debenture holders.
So these were 2% non convertible debentures that means the coupon rate or the interest was 2% and the yearly yield to maturity was 9.
80% and the total amount which was made by the Tata Steel was about 1500 crores.
And these were issued at the discount on the face value of 15%.
So that means if one debenture was of hundred rupees, 15% 15% discount was offered on the face value of hundred rupees.
So this discount will make the, after this discount the value of the the face value will be 85% for the debenture holders.
So the issue was done by the company in 2012 April and the maturity date was 22 April that means the term was of 10 years and after 10 years they are compulsorily redeemable debentures.
As I told you that coupon rate was of 2% interest and this was annually payable and the rating was double A plus by care and break wares.
Now it is over here a very much necessary for you to understand that before a company goes ahead with the issue of any types of debt securities whether debts or bonds.
It is compulsory to have a rating from the companies which are into rating.
so that the investors when they are investing they come to know that what rating has been given by the company, so that becomes important for the credit worthiness of the company which is taking the loan from the company.
Let us now take another example of Tata Power, the Tata Power had launched perpetual debentures.
Now what are perpetual debentures, as we have already discussed that perpetual debentures, which are not redeemable that means the debenture holders will be the creditors for lifelong to the company and Tata Power we know it is India's largest integrated private power utility.
It launched the offering of perpetual debentures of 1500 rupees crore and they had the joint lead arrangers or the banker's for this issue were Standard Chartered Bank and Yes Bank.
So as per the debt securities, issue of debt securities regulations there should be a lead merchant banker also who should assess the company in taking the due diligence for the issue of these securities and these debentures who are perpetual in nature.
So there was no maturity of the redemption and they were callable only at the option of the company and the coupon rate which was set up on the debentures was 11.
And these debentures they rank senior only to the share capital of the company and this provided equity characteristics to these hybrid debentures.
And also what are the compliances, how many registers have to be maintained by the company, what are the purposes for which the investment instruments of the company can be used by the company.
So all this gives you an information on the and give provides one inside on the corporate borrowings and investments.
Thank you very much.
we also need to understand what is price sensitive information? Under 1992 regulations, price sensitive information means any information which is directly or indirectly related to a company.
And which, if published is likely to materially affect the prices of the securities of a company.
And certain informations are deemed to be price sensitive information.
For example, periodical financial results of the company, intended declaration of dividends of the company, whether interim or final dividend.
Issue of securities on buyback of securities any major expansion plans of the company or execution of new projects of the company, amalgamations, mergers or acquisitions or takeovers of the company.
Disposal of the whole or substantial undertaking or the part of the undertaking of the company.
Any other significant changes in the policies or plans or operations of the company.
All these were deemed to be price sensitive information under 1992 regulations.
Let's have a look at unpublished price sensitive information under 2015 regulations Over here before understanding this price sensitive information ,we need to understand what is generally available information.
Because on the basis of generally available information, the definition of unpublished price sensitive information or UPSI has been given by the 2015 regulation.
generally available information means information that is accessible to public on a non discriminatory basis.
On the basis of this let us understand what is unpublished price sensitive information? And it means any information again relating to a company or to it’s securities whether directly or indirectly.
And the information which is not generally available which upon becoming generally available is likely to materially affect the price of the securities.
And it shall ordinarily include the following but is not limited .
There are also being the unpublished price sensitive informations in this case also which are which are financial results ,dividends, change in the capital structure of the company ,mergers ,demergers ,acquisitions ,amalgamations, listings, de-listings ,disposals, expansion of the business.
And such other transactions changes in the key managerial personnel and material events in accordance with the listing agreement.
you see that here we have 2 more categories where we are talking about changes in the material in the managerial personnel as well as changes in the material events in accordance with the listing agreement.
Over here we have expanded again the scope of deemed unpublished price sensitive information over 1992 regulations.
Both the regulations they had instructed that there should be code of internal procedure and conduct.
In 1992 regulations, the company had to make a code of internal procedures and conduct which should be followed by the company and its employees while dealing with the un-published price sensitive information.
2015 regulations talk about 2 types of codes.
First is the code of procedure and practice which says that, a board of directors of a listed company has to formulate and publish a code of procedures and practices for fair disclosure of unpublished price sensitive information.
And these procedures have to be followed by persons who are engaged in or who are having access to unpublished price sensitive information .
The second point says that a board of directors of any company or any intermediary or the any prson who is connected during that operations of the company, business operations of the company has an access to the unpublished price sensitive information.
He has to formulate and also publish code of conduct for the regulation, monitoring as well as reporting of the trading of its employees as well as have a look into the compliance of the provisions.
And for this purposes of that they are also mandated to appoint a compliance officer .
this provision has been stringent not only for the company, but also for the intermediaries and other persons who are associated with the company.
there were certain disclosures which are required under 1992 regulations.
under 1992 regulations, 3 types of disclosure were required of by any person who was holding more than 5% shares or voting rights.
Then the 2nd category of directors and officers of the listed company.
And the third category of disclosures were required by any person, who is part of the promoter group or he is a promoter himself.
Let us look at the first category of disclosure.
He has to disclose to the company within 2 days of having acquiring these voting rights of the shares And he is also under the responsibility of continual disclosure .
So let's first start with alteration of capital.
We know that it is not necessary for a company to get incorporated with capital but if any company has to do any business its needs a share capitals.
So therefore most of the companies they get incorporated with a share capital.
And the memorandum of every company it has a clause which is known as capital clause which gives the information about the capital which a company can rays which is known as a authorized capital.
So if any alteration is done to the capital.
What do we mean by alteration? If any modification of change is done to the share capital of the company that is covered by alteration of capital under section 61 of the Companies Act, 2013.
Now let us look in the ways in which a company can alter its capital.
First of all it can increase its authorized capital or as per the amount which is required.
The question is why a company decides to increase its share capital? What is the reason behind that?A company may by expanding its business or it may be diversifying its business.
So that is why companies is in need of further capital.
So the company can go ahead with further issue of capital which means that the company has increased its capital.
So the company when increase its capital that is the change in the share capital of the company which is known as the increase in the capital of the company.
The other type of change which can be made by the company is that reduction of the share capital.
When the company reduces its share capital again the reason for the reduction of the share capital is also in the hands of the company.
Companies act is silent about it but how the process has to be followed, which process has to be followed, how the capital can be reduced by the company that is given by the companies act.
Now why a company would go ahead with reduction of it's share capital? One of the reasons can be that companies having excess capital.
So the company does not want to incur any burden of paying dividend to the shareholders because it is not using that excess capitals, so it decides to pay of the excess capital to the shareholders that results in reduction of the share capital.
So the other form of alteration of capital can be that company consolidates it's share capital and it again it divides that into shares of a higher amount or a larger amount than the existing shares of the company.
For example let's say a company is having a share capital of 10,000 rupees which is divided into shares 1000 shares or 10,000 shares of rupees one each.
Company consolidates that 10,000 and re divides that into shares of rupees 10 face value.
So the number of shares will be reduced because now the shareholding the face value or the nominal value of the shares has increased to rupees 10.
So accordingly the number of shares will be reduced.
So over here that what the company has to keep in mind is that the whatever are the rights or the voting percentage of the shareholders that voting percentage of the existing shareholders should not changed because of this alteration.
So the proportion of the voting percentage should remain the same even if when the companies consolidating its shares and converting them or dividing them into shares of a larger amount.
Another thing which a company can do is that it can convert it's share capital into stock and then re convert this talk back into the share capital.
Now what is the need of a company to convert it's share capital into stock and what is a stock? Let’s say that companies having a share capital of 10,000 rupees which is divided into 1000 shares.
The company consolidates all those shares into one and the stock is worth 10,000 rupees.
So it is not divided into shares.
So when the share capital is in lumpsum but it is not divided into shares then it is known as stock.
So the company will go for conversion into stock only when all the shares are fully paid up shares.
And company knows that how many shareholders are there and how many of them are having, what is the percentage of share holding that they are having, what are their voting rights, what are their dividend rights.
So that when they are converted into stock their rights remain the same.
There is no loss or no loss occurs to the shareholders when such type of conversion takes place.
And when company finds it convenient it can convert stock back into the shares also.
After that another way is that that company subdivides its existing shares into shares of smaller amounts which is also known as talks split or shares split.
Where a share having a face value one share of face value rupees 10 is subdivided, let say into 2 shares of rupees 5 each or 10 shares of rupees 1 each.
So this is how the conversion is made then also on this it has to be seen that when such type of a conversion is there whatever is the proportion of the amount which has already been paid up on the shares and whatever is the balance amount which is unpaid that proportion shall remain the same in the case of the stock split or share split.
Then if the company had decided to offer the shares but the shares have not been taken up by the person who had agreed to take those shares and companies not in a position to issue those shares then company can cancel that share capital that will also lead to the reduction of the share capital.
Now in such a case when although it seems to be reduction of the share capital but it is not taken as a reduction of share capital because these shares was not issued by the company.
So these are the methods these are the five methods through which a company can alter its a capital.
And so the face need is felt by the company to alter its share capital companies act silent about the reasons for alteration of capital.
Now let us discuss further issue of capital or which is also known as further public offering or which is also known as in FPO in abbreviation.
This is covered by section 62 of the Companies Act of 2013.
Now when a company goes ahead with further issue of capital there are certain requirements which are given by section 62 that first of all this further issue of capital should be offered to these persons who are listed under Section 62.
Now Companies Act, 1956 had dealt with this under section 81 and it is also known as the rights issue because first of all this offer has to be given to the existing shareholders of the company.
And they get this right under their pre emptive rights because they are existing shareholders ofthe company.
So that is why this issue is also known as rights issues because they are getting this offer of further issue of capital by the company because they are having the pre emptive rights as existing shareholders of the company.
Now how the rights issue have to be given.
In such a case an offer letter is made by the company and this offer letter gives the number of the shares which are offered to the existing shareholders in the form of rights issue.
The time period is also given to them which would be not less than 15 days.
But we should not be more than 30 days within which they have to accept these offers.
This offer or they can reject this offer, they can decline to accept these right shares.
Another important thing over there is that that these rights, these existing shareholders they are also given the right to renounce these shares in favour of any other person.
So they can renounce any part of this shares which are offer to them or the full number of shares can be renounce in favour of any other person.
So this is what is known as rights issue.
in case the 30 days passed and the shareholder, existing shareholders does not like to take these shares then these shares they go back in the possession of the board of directors.
And then they issue those shares they dispose off these those shares as they find it necessary.
not giving any loss to the company for this issue and also not to the shareholders.
So this issue of shares if the rights shareholders rights issue if it is not accepted by the existing shareholders then the board of directors they can issue these shares or dispose off these shares in a manner, we should not be disadvantages to the company as well as to the shareholders of the company.
Then the second persons which fall in this list is that these shares should be offered to the employees under the scheme of employee stock option.
And for this purpose the company has to pass a special resolution then the shares will be offered to the employees under the ESOs.
The third category is of any person if has been authorized by the special resolution of the company.
Now these a persons may fall in above two categories that is maybe existing shareholders of the company or they may be employees of the company or they may not be they may not fall within these two above stated categories.
And these shares can be issued for a cash or for a consideration other than a cash and the price of the issue of these shares has to be determined by a registered valuer and he has to submit valuation report on the basis of this valuation report the price of issue of such shares is decided.
Now after the company has gone ahead with the further issue of capital, after the process comes to an end within 30 days, this has to be notified by the company to the registrar of companies.
Now section 62 under subsection 4 has a very important provision which deals with power to convert loans into capital.
Then it can direct the company to do so.
Over here the terms and conditions of such conversion have to be decided and it is not necessary that the company has to accept this offer, company has the right to give its opinion on this that whether it agrees for such type of conversion or not.
And it is also not necessary that this option of converting debentures or loans into shares of the company should be at the time of issue of these debentures or taking of loan by the company.
So this can be later on consider in public Interest by the government that these shares, these debentures and loans they should be converted into shares of the company.
And so if the company wants to appeal it can go to National Company Law Tribunal and appeal it to the tribunal within 60 days of such order of conversion.
Now as of now National Company Law Tribunal has not been established, so all such powers are exercised by company law board which was earlier working under the Companies Act 1956.
So till the time NCLT get establish, this power will remain vested with the company law board only.
And again this has to be notified to the ROC.
next comes the bonus shares, under section 63 of the Companies Act, 2013 as the bonus shares as the name indicates they are given free.
So bonus shares they are actually an accretion to the share capital and they given free of cost to the existing shareholders.
So the funds which can be used by the companies for issuing such bonus shares can be the free reserves of the company, it can be the amount which is lying in the securities premium account or it can be the capital redemption reserve.
So these are the three funds or reserve which can be used by the company for issuing bonus shares.
And why a company wants to issue bonus shares? Because company has profits in its within its profit and loss account and company is in need of shares, so its a need of increasing the share capital.
So instead of going ahead with the further issue of capital, company issues unissued shares of the company to the existing shareholders.
So that there is the process of capitalisation of profit takes place and those unissued shares or the profit of the company they get converted into shares of the company.
Now sometimes this question arises that when there are reserved which are created from revaluation of the assets, can they be that reserve be used for the issue of bonus shares? No it cannot be used.
Any type of reserve which is created by revaluation of the assets, this amount cannot be used by the company in issuing a bonus shares to the shareholders.
Bonus shares also cannot be given in lieu of dividend.
This has to be kept in mind.
First of all that company should be authorised by its articles to issue bonus shares and resolution should be passed for issue of bonus shares and if the company has defaulted in payment ofany interest or any principal debt or any fixed deposit or debt securities of the company, company cannot go ahead with the issue of bonus shares.
And also if there are outstanding partly paid up shares of the company then those are partly paid up shares should be converted into, they should be made fully paid up only then the company can go ahead with the issue of bonus shares.
Next is reduction of share capital.
A company act does not want any company to reduce its share capital because this is the fundamental capital with, this is the most important requirement of the company or the amount which has to be maintained, whose santity has to be maintained by the company.
So the companies act says that we won't permit you to reduce the share capital unless and until you do it as per the procedure which is given by the companies act.
And why the company wants to reduce its share capital? As we have already discussed that depends upon the need of the company.
Reduction of share capital is dealt by section 66 of the Companies Act, 2013.
Under 1956 Act there was sections 101 to 104 which delt with the reduction of the share capital.
Now which type of a company can go ahead with reduction of the share capital? A company which is limited by shares, so it is having a share capital.
Any guarantee company which is having a share capital can also by passing its special resolution, can go for the reduction of the share capital.
Now how reduction of share capital has to be done? company can extinguish or reduce the liability of on any of the shares in respect of the share capital which has not been paid which has not been paid.
For example if a company has issued shares with the face value of rupees 10 and the premium payable is 490 rupees.
So the total for 1 share, a shareholder has to pay 500 rupees.
Now in such a situation if at the time of offer for the subscription of securities if the company has asked for 50% of the amount as application and allotment money, 50% of the amount has to be is kept in the balance to be called at the time of, through the times, through the means of calls being raised by board of directors.
In such a situation a shareholder has a paid 250 rupees per share and 250 rupees has been kept in the balance.
Now if a company wants to reduce its share capital what it can do, it can extinguish 250 rupees, it can make this 500 rupees share with the face value of 500 rupees can be converted as a fully paid up share of rupees 250.
So the shareholder is not required to pay extra 250 rupees now.
So that amount has been reduced.
So the share capital reduces by 50% of amount of the per share which the company wanted to raise.
So this is one of the methods through which a company can reduce and then the second point says that either with or without following this extinguishment or the reduction of the liability a company can cancel any paid up share capital which is lost or which is not represented by the available assets of the company.
When a company says that it has a share capital of 1 crore, it should have assets which should be worth 1 crore.
Now if the actual assets with the company are let say only 90 lakh rupees and the company is showing its share capital to be 1 crore that means company has lost 10 lakh rupees from its share capital or it is not available represented by the available assets.
This is the time when the company has to reduce its share capital to give to indicate it's a real work that it's share capital is actually 90 lacs but not 1 crore rupees.
And similarly the second requirement will be that if the company is having excess of the share capital beyond its needs.
So if the company has raised capital which the company not able to use it right now, so company can repay that to the shareholders and reduce its share capital because company will haveto incur additional burden of dividend payment on the shares which on the share capital which the company is not using currently.
So these are the ways in which a company can go ahead with reduction of the share capital.
Now what are the requirement for this, that company will not be allowed to reduce it share capital if it is in arrears of repayment.
This is what has to be seen that if the company has defaulted or the arrears of interest or the principal amount or the deposits has to be paid and company has not paid them.
The company will not be allowed to go ahead with the reduction of share capital and before reduction of share capital company has to propose a scheme to the National Company Law Tribunal or the company law board and seeks its approval before such type of a conversion.
And what tribunal has to take into account or the company law board has to do? It has to forward this scheme to the central government.
if the company is listed then it has to be sent to the SEBI also, otherwise it has to be sent to ROC and also the creditors of the company that tribunal ask for their representation after considering all their representation then the tribunal decides whether it should approve this scheme of reduction of share capital or it should reject the scheme.
Now let us discuss section 67 of the Companies Act, 2013 which says that there is a restriction on the company on purchasing its own share capital not share capital but purchasing its own shares or if the company wants to give loans to anyone to purchase its own shares that restriction is contained in section 67 of the Companies Act 2013.
Now what is meant by purchase by company of its own shares? Its a company is issuing coming up with the public issue of let say 1,000 crores and company is buying its own shares from the public issue worth 1,000 let say 100 crores.
So the company has to reduce it share capital because it is using its own money to purchase his own shares.
So accordingly there should be consequent reduction of the share capital because the ultimately company has been able to raise only 1,000 crore minus 100 crores.
So that reduction has to be done.
This is what is the restriction given under section 67, it says that a company is restricted to purchase its own shares but if it purchases its own share there should be consequent reduction of the share capital.
And no companies allowed to give any financial assistance to any person to purchase its own shares or it should not give any kind of loan, it should not give any kind of financial assistance, it should not give any kind of guarantee or otherwise help any person in purchasing shares of its own.
but there are certain exceptions to this, where these restrictions do not apply.
For example in the case of a banking company, if a banking company in the ordinary course of business is giving loan and the person is using loan to buy any public issue given by that banking company only.
So then it is buying the shares of the banking company but we need to understand this exception willnot, this restriction will not be applicable to this banking company because this is the ordinary business of the banking company to give loan to the the public for any reason whatever they have in their mind.
So their restrictions will not applied in the case of a banking company.
Next is about where the company is providing money to the employees for purchase of shares of its employees or where the employees they or the shares to be later on distributed by the employees they are kept with the trustees of the company.
So if the company is providing money for purchase or subscription of fully paid up shares of the company or its holding company if the shares are held by the trustee for the benefit of the employees or such shares are held by the employees of the company then such restriction will not be applicable.
Then company can also land money to its employees to buy the shares of the company or its holding company.
But the restriction is over here is that employees they will not include the directors or key managerial personnel of the company and the amount of loan should not exceed a six times six months of their wages or the salary.
That means for a period of six month whatever salary or wages they are getting, this amount should not be more than that amount.
So over here there another restriction is that employees do not include directors of the company or they do not include the key managerial personnel of the company.
Lets come to very important aspect of alteration of share capital which is in the form of buyback of shares.
Now buyback of shares is dealt by section 68 of the Companies Act, 2013.
When we say buyback that means company has issued first companies have issued those shares now they are buying back from the existing shareholders or they are buying back from the open market.
Now what is the fund and what is the need for buyback?Now the need is against felt by the company may be companies having surplus funds so that is why it want to give some kind of bonus to shareholders it is giving them more money at the time of buying back the offer ahhh is giving the shareholders more money in comparison to the current market price of the existing shares or the company wants to wind up any of the business, it wants to end any business of the company is having too much of shareholder, too many shareholders ,now it wants to reduce its share capital, wants to reduce the number of shareholders.
So that the dividend requirement is less or there may be tax related purposes for which the company wants to go ahead with the buyback of shares.
So companies act again is silent about the reasons for the buyback of shares.
But the procedure is given by the Companies Act, under section 68.
Now the fund which can be used for the purpose of buyback of shares includes again the free reserves, securities premium account of the company or the proceeds of issue of any shares or other securities which are offered by the company.
So free reserves, securities premium account or if the company had come up with any offer of initials or other securities that amount can be used by the company those proceeds can be used by the company for buyback of shares.
Now the restriction is that if the company has earlier issued any shares so from the proceeds of the earlier issue the same type of securities cannot be brought back.
this has to be seen that it says that no buyback of any kind of shares or other securities is allowed from earlier issue of the same kind of shares or same kind of other specified security.
Now there are certain conditions which are required to be complied with by the company before it goes ahead with buyback of shares.
First of all it should be authorized by the articles of the company to buy back its shares.
Then a special resolution should be passed by the company in the general meeting.
And where the buyback is less than 10% or less than 10% of up to 10% or less than 10% of the total equity share capital of the company.
In such a situation there is no requirement of the special resolution provided that the board of directors pass the resolution for the buyback of the of the shares.
And buy back should not be 25% or buyback should be 20% or less of the aggregate of the paid up capital and free reserves of the company, this is the third requirement.
It should be at least it should be 20% or less of the aggregate of the paid up capital and free reserves of the company.
And after that the ratio of the aggregate of secured and unsecured a debts owed by the company after buyback should not be more than twice the paid-up capital and its free reserve.
Yes higher ratio can also be provided by the central government later on but so far it is that it should not be twice the amount of paid up capital and the free reserves.
And all the shares which are under the scheme of buying back they should be fully paid up and if the shares they should also comply with the SEBI regulations.
Because SEBI has also given regulations for buyback of securities so those regulations have also to be complied with.
Where SEBI regulations are not applicable in such a situation the rules which are frame by the companies act those rules have to be followed by the company before it goes for the buyback of shares.
And the next condition says that buyback should not be made within a period of one year from the date of closure of the preceding buyback offer if company had made any.
So if the company they cannot be two consecutive buyback without a gap of one year between these two buybacks.
Now a notice has to be given to the shareholders because a resolution has to be passed which is a special resolution.
So notice has to be given to the shareholders and there should be an explanatory statement given to the notice that the company is going ahead with the buy back then all the material facts should be given, the necessity for such buyback should be given, what are the class of shares which are being bought back or the securities which are being up bought back and what is the amount total amount which is involved with the buyback of the securities and what will be the time limit for the completion of the buy back.
All such information should be given to the shareholders in the explanatory statement in the notice which is sent to the to the shareholders.
Now every buyback has to be completed within one year of the date of passing of the special resolution for the buyback.
This is a another requirement of section this section under the companies act and buy back and from whom the buyback can be done? It can be from the existing shareholders or the security holders on the proportionate basis or it can be from the open market or it can be from purchasing shares which are with the employees of the company, which were given this shares as sweat equity shares or under the stock option, employees stock option scheme.
So these are the three sources or three targets whom the company can decide from whom the company wants to go for buyback of shares.
Now another requirement is that there has to be a declaration of solvency by the board of directors of the company.
And what is the declaration of solvency, that the company is capable of meeting is liabilities and it will not be rendered insolvent within a period of one year from the date of declaration which is adopted by the board.
So this is what has to be kept in mind that declaration of solvency has to be given to the ROC that the company will not become insolvent within one year from the buy back.
Now over here if a company is a listed company then this declaration of solvency has to be given to SEBI also.
Then in the case of this declaration of solvency it has to be signed by two directors of the company and if the company has one of the managing directors then the managing director has to sign this declaration of solvency.
Then after the completion of the process of buyback these shares should be physically destroyed or extinguished within next seven days.
And company should not go ahead with restrict with the further issue of share capital or the allotment of the new shares within a period of six months if the company faces a ban on the further issue of share capital after the buyback is complete for next six months.
But only the routine procedure which the company has to do that can be done like company can issue go ahead with the bonus issue of share.
And if the company has to convert certain warrants into shares that conversion can take place.
If the company has to come up with stock option scheme that scheme can be taken place that scheme can be followed sweat equity shares can be issued.
And if the preference shares have to be converted into equity shares such type of routine matters can be done.
But only the restrictions for the new allotment of shares.
Then after the buyback is complete then return has to be filed to the ROC.
Now section 70 has a certain prohibition on the buyback of securities that buyback is not allowed under certain conditions it says that no company should directly or indirectly purchase its own shares or any other specified securities through its subsidiaries or including its through any any of its subsidiaries including its own subsidiary companies.
It should not be through any investment company or group of investment companies.
And if the company has defaulted in repayment of deposits or the interest payment or redemption of debentures or preference shares or payment of dividend to any shareholders or repayment of any loan or any interest payable to any financial institutions or banking companies if any of these defaults is present the company will be prohibited from going ahead with the buyback.
And this prohibition is given under section 70 of the Companies Act 2013.
Now section 65 deals with unlimited company which converts into a limited company by passing a resolution.
It has to provide for certain reserve share capital and it says that if it wants to convert into a limited company it has to increase the nominal share capital of the company by increasing the nominal amount of each of its shares.
But the condition over here is that the increase capital can be called up only in the event and for the purposes of the winding up of the company.
This was capital cannot be called up before that and it also says that it should provide specified portion ofits uncalled share capital to be called up only in the event and for the purposes of the company being wound up.
So such type of a reserve has to be created by the company which is converting from the unlimited to unlimited company.
So this is the reserve share capital under section 65A of the 2013.
Let us come to the SEBI regulations which were amended in 2013.
So we are referring to SEBI buyback regulations amendment of 2013, certain important amendments were made in these regulations and which are under lot of debate also that whether they will be workable or not.
So the companies are mandated that they should buy at least 50% of the offer size otherwise there is a provision forfeiture of 2.5 % of the total amount, earmarked for the buyback.
Companies are mandated to keep 25% of the amount earmarked for the buy back in an escrow account in a separate acount and should have to complete the buy back process within a period of six months instead of 12 months.
So the buyback has to be now completed within a period of six month and promoters have been restricted from executing any transaction either in the on-market or off-market during the buyback period.
So this is a restriction on the promoters of the company.
And companies are also prohibited from raising further capital for one year from the closure of the buyback or make another buyback offer within a period of one year from the date of the closure of the preceding offer.
And companies are required to buy back 15% on more of the capital only by way of tender offer which is similar to book building process.
So these are the amendments which are made by the regulations in 2013.
let's now take some recent examples of buybacks which have been completed in 2014 only in India.
So about eight companies they completed their share buy-back process in 2014 and they had targeted tobuy back shares from the public for rupees 297 crore through the open market route on the stock exchanges and the few of the names of these companies are Maharashtra Seamless, Motilal Oswal Financial Services, Gujarat Apollo Industries they were the major companies which offered buy- back and they had completed the buyback process of rupees 297 crores.
So this is all in brief about the alteration of capital and its implications.
Public Offer, as the term indicates that this is an offer which is made by the company to the public.
This is an offer for the public issue where the company wants to raise money from the public.
It can be in the form of IPO that is Initial Public Offering.
Or FPO, that is Further Public Offering.
Or OFS, OFS is Offer for Sale.
Now, what is meant by Initial Public Offer? As again the name indicates that the public offer which is initially made which is the first public offer by any company.
it can be a newly listed company which is going for public offer .
It can be any listed company which has so far although it has listed its securities but has not gone for any public issue.
that can be any unlisted company which wants to get its securities listed and reach the public through the public offer.
Or it can be a listed company which is for the first time going to the public through its Initial Public Offer.
In further public offering or the issue of capital is by the listed companies which have earlier gone through the public issues And now they want to increase their share capitals.
that is why they are going ahead with the further public offer.
Offer for sale is aware existing shareholders of the company.
They want to sell their shares to the, they want to propose to sell their shares to the public.
That will be known as offer for sale.
For example if a promoter is having 50% shares in the company and he wants to offer them to the public then through the means of the company he can offer his shares to the public for sale .
Then it will be known as offer for sale.
Similarly, in the case of disinvestment by public sector undertaking, the Government of India is holding shares in the name of the President of India which are offered to the public for the disinvestment schemes through the means of a public issue.
Then it becomes offer for sale.
Now, Section 23 of the Companies Act 2013 says that a company can issue, a public company can issue securities to the public through the means of prospectus.
They can also issue securities through the means of private placement through the rights issue of bonus issue.
what is meant by prospectus? discuss it little later.
prospectus is offer document which gives an offer to the shareholders for the for buying securities or subscribing to the securities or shares of the company.
Private placement, when it is given, when the offer is given to selected group of person.
And rights issue is when the offer is given to the existing shareholders.
Bonus issue is when the offer is WHEN THE shares are issued to existing shareholders where they don't have to pay the value of the shares.
And when a company is going for the public offer then it has to list its securities.
The listing of securities and the listing agreement is provided by SCRA only after the listing of securities any public offer can be made by the public company to the public.
Let us now discuss what is private placement.
Private placement defined by Section 23 of the Companies Act, 2013 where it first of all it says that have a private company can issue Securities.
A private company can issue securities obviously through rights issue and bonus issue because rights issue is given to the existing shareholders.
And bonus issue is also given to the existing shareholders free of cost.
A private company can raise funds through these 2 methods.
And also it can go ahead with the private placement.
Section 42 says that private placement does not include cannot be given to qualified institutional buyers.
And it can also not given to the employees of the company.
Because employees of the companies, they receive securities under the employee stock option.
this cannot be given to the employees of the company.
Let’s come to the Rights Issue.
The rights issue as I told you that it is made to the existing shareholders of the company.
when the company is in need of other issue of capital.
the first offer is given to the existing shareholders of the company.
they can 15 to 30 days time is given to them.
that if they want to accept those shares that can accept to share otherwise they can reject it.
Or they can use their right to renounce this shares in favor of any other person.
this is what is meant by the rights issue.
Bonus issue is when the capitalization of profit is done by the company.
if the company has free reserves or it has profits in the securities premium account .
Or if it has a capital redemption reserve, amount from this can be transferred in the form of shares.
And these shares can be issued to the existing shareholders of the company free of cost.
Now there are certain exceptions where the companies not required to issue any prospectus.
this is the first where shares are given to the existing shareholders.
or existing debenture holders has so than full a prospectus is not required Only an offer document is to be made by the company giving the necessity of raising this fund.
that is how the company decides the proportions.
no prospectus is to be issued but an offer document has to be sent to them.
And then in the case of where shares and debentures were earlier issued.
And they they already listed and their uniform, the new issues also uniform in the in all respects with the existing shares or debentures then the company is also not required to issue any prospectus.
Now let us come to the deemed prospectus.
Now any document where a company is giving offer for sale that is also deemed to be a prospectus.
Because in case of offer for sale one existing shareholders through the company is selling its shares to the company.
this is offer for sale by existing shareholders of the company but the document which is made through which the public is invited to subscribe for thes share that document is also deemed to be a prospectus.
Now let us understand what is a shelf prospectus.
Now shelf prospectus is meant for those companies or public Financial Institutions are scheduled commercial banks which are frequently raising money from the public.
if you look into the financial institutions or the scheduled banks, all of them.
They are raising money because they have to give this to the other people who require money from the banks or the loan from the bank.
they have to raise frequently from the public in such a situation every time they have to make a prospectus.
facility is given to them that they can make a shelf prospectus for one with the tendency of 1 years.
in during that year company can raise any company can raise 3 or 4 times a public issue through the same prospectous.
shelf prospectus is like a prospectus or the information which is lying on the shelf in the office of the registrar companies.
once the prospectus has been file.
During 1 year the company can go ahead with 2 or 3 or 4 depending upon the need of the company for the public issues on the similar type of shares or the debentures for which the shelf prospectus has been made.
They have to be uniform in all matters which are given in the shelf prospectus.
the company is not required to every time to write a prospectus and submitted to ROC.
Now over here but the thing which has to be maintained by the company that, let say that company has come up with one public issue.
Now after 3 months the company goes ahead second public issue on the same shelf prospectus.
Within these 3 months, whatever changes in the financial position of the company has incurred or is any information which the public should know.
That information should be filed in the form of information memorandum to ROC.
that the necessary changes can be made and this information can be circulated to the public also.
this is the requirement in case of a company goes for shelf prospectus.
let us now discuss the Red Herring Prospectus.
Red Herring Prospectus does not have the quantum of the securities which are being offered by the company and also does not have the final price of the securities.
If there is any change in the Red Herring Prospectus that changes to be notified in the full prospectus.
what is Abridged prospectus? Abridged prospectus is a short perspective which contains only the salient features of the prospectus.
Now prospectus is document and it is not possible for a company to give prospectus to the huge prospectus to everyone because a lot of expenditure is involved in treating such kind of a prospectus.
So the Companies Act gives this privilege to the companies that they can make an abridged prospectus which contains salient features of the full prospectus.
And they can be issued along with the application form to the respective investors.
if investor want to read the full prospectus he can write to the company and get the full copy of the full prospectus.
this is what is meant by the abridged prospectus.
we have discussed what is prospectus, shelf prospectus, red herring prospectus and abridged prospectus.
Now this prospectus as I told you this, all this information which is given by the company in the prospectus has to be through information because public is at the mercy of the promoters of the company.
What they write the prospectus on the basis of that they invest their hard earned money.
the golden rule public deposits it says that the public is at the mercy of the companies’ promoters.
whatever is stated in the prospectus should be stated as scrupulous and as scrupulous as accurate possible.
that is why there are liabilities which are put up on the promoters of the company or the directors of the company.
If the prospectus contains any untrue statement or any misrepresentation or any false statement.
let us now discuss the liability for misstatement in the prospectus.
first liability is in the form of tortuous liability.
This liability which is given under the heading of damages for deceit.
And the most important case in the leading case over here is there is Derry vs. Peek.
Now in this case what happened there was a company which was running, which used to run tramways through the mechanical power.
the company wanted to have a sanction for running the tramways by steam power and the company had applied for the sanctions .
2 sanctions are required.
1 was a from the Parliament and other was from Board of trade.
The Parliament had given the sanction that the company can go ahead with steam running tramways with the steam power.
On the basis of this ,they issued a prospectus where they had written the directors that written the prospectus.
If company has now necessary sanction for running tramways on the with steam power so the company will be a profit earning company and the huge profits will be gained by the company.
on the basis of this the shareholders applied for the shares.
Later on the board of trade refuse to give this grant this sanction to the company.
few shareholders they sued the directors of the company that the directors they had given a false statement in the company.
Due to which the shareholders they have faced loss because the company has not got the approval for running tramways on by the steam power.
over here the director were not held liable on the ground that they had this honest believe that the approval by the board of trade will be given.
Because once the approval is given by the parliament the board of trade will definitely give the there was a honest believe that approval will be given.
the directors were not held liable against the for compensating the shareholders.
Now this created a lot of problem.
Because on the basis of honest believe the directors they were able to save themselves against the dispute which was raised by the shareholders for the false statement which they had made.
that is why to take care of this issue requirement of compensation was fixed up which is in the form of civil liability under section 35.
That even if the directors have the honest believe but the statement is false, they will be held liable to compensate the shareholders.
every director of the company, every person who authorized himself to be named as the director of the company, every promoter of the company who is named as promoter in of the prospective and every expert who has consented to give expert opinion on the prospectus.
All 4 of them, they will be held liable to compensate the shareholder.
And shareholder who has suffered loss due to the statement which was false and their liability will be joint and several liability.
this is how the problem which was created through the decision of Derry vs Peek week was overcome by putting this section of compensation under section 35 of the Companies Act.
Next is a rescission for misrepresentation.
This remedy lies in the hands of the shareholder.
if he wants to take back his shares, he can apply to the court for cancellation of his contract for of shares.
he will return the share certificate to the company and company will refund his money back to him.
But obviously there are certain precautions which have to be taken by the shareholder over here.
They should not be undue delay in that, shareholder should not affirm that he has received.
And now he is keeping with his share and also the winding up process should not begin in between.
if the shareholder affirms, if there is undue long delay for offering for rescission for misrepresentation .
Or the winding up of the company has started than this remedy will not be available in the hands of the shareholder.
The next remedy is in the form of criminal liability which is given by section 34.
over here if any false statement or any untrue statement is given by the directors of the company then that they can be held liable.
Under section 447 of the Companies Act ,2013 which deals with punishment for fraudulent purposes.
this is a common section which supplies at number of places.
even if a person gives a false statement , even if the false statement relates to the prospectus the directors and promoters will be liable for this.
And criminally liable for this under section 447.
the false statement or untrue statement can be false in context.
It can be false in form.
It can be untrue.
Or it can be also misleading.
if it is misleading and due to these statement or the misrepresentation if the investor is mislead for investing in the company.
Then the directors that can be held liable under this particular section.
Now what will be the difference to the directors.
They can say that the statement was immaterial.
Or the fact was immaterial then they can say that they honestly believe and at the till the time of the issue of the prospectus they believe that this statement is true.
They can also say that the person did not authorize the prospectus containing such true statement or misrepresentation.
And when he came to know that this has been published he gave a public notice of this .
Or he can also give as a difference that he was not the director of the company.
And when he came to know that his name is put up as a director in the prospectus then he give a public notice of this.
these are few defences which are available to the person.
When they are criminally held liable under this particular section.
Then another a last remedy is under section 36 which is about punishment for falsely inducing persons to invest money.
if any person is inducing any person on the basis of the false information to invest money then this can also be punished under Section 447 of the Companies Act.
Good I am Dr. Harpreet Kaur.
I am professor of law at National Law University, Delhi.
Today, I will be dealing with module 5 of the course of Corporate Law.
This module is about share capital; the types of shares, the nature of the shares, kinds of shares and also what is the need of the companies to have a share capital and will also discuss the rights and liabilities of the shareholders.
So if we look into the objectives of this course the students will understand that what is the need of a company to raise a share capital or can it manage its affairs or business needs through the means of the borrowing.
Then, if it is a share capital has been raised what are the types of shares that can be raised by the company.
What are the rights of different types of shareholders and then what is the nature of the of a share what is the basic nature of a share and also we will also understand what are the expectations of a company from the shareholders and what are the rights and duties of the shareholders of a company? So, let us first of all understand what is the difference between capital and a share capital of a company? So, you see that whether it is a capital whether it is a share capital both the terms these terms are used synonymously.
So, capital if it is divided into smaller units in the form of shares it is known as a share capital and it is a need of the company to get incorporated with the capital if the company wants to conduct a business.
Although, the Companies Act does not say that having a capital is a compulsory requirement for incorporating a company.
But most of the companies they get incorporated along with the capital because they are incorporated for the purpose of running a business and for running a business and conducting a business a company needs to have a capital.
Now, the capital clause of the memorandum says that you have to mention what will be the authorised capital of the company and how many shares it will it will be divided.
The number of the share should be written and also the fixed amount of the share should also be written in the memorandum of the of any company which is getting incorporated.
Now, if you look into 1956 Act, then the section 13 4A of the Companies Act of 1956, it said that you have to mention the nominal capital its amount and also the value of the shares and also the number of shares which will be raised by the company.
Similarly, section 4E of the Companies Act, 2013 also gives this requirement that the company has to write the nominal value or the amount of the capital with which it is getting incorporated and also the fixed amount of the shares and also the number of the shares into which the capital will be divided and it is necessary that no subscriber to the memorandum should have less than one share.
Now, minimum Capital requirement is also a requirement at a given by the Companies Act like; for a public company it is necessary that it should have a minimum paid up share capital of 5 lakh Rupees at the time of incorporation and for a private company it is necessary that it should have a share capital of minimum one lakh at the time of incorporation and these provisions are given by section 2 subsection 71 and sub section 68 of the Companies Act, 2013.
Now, the question arises that how a company decides that what type of a capital? How it should raise the capital, whether it should be through the public issue whether it should be through the investors from the public or it should borrow the money.
So, complete financial analysis has to be done by the company with how much amount it wants to raise?What is the market sentiment, what is the interest rate or what type of dividend it will have to give, what amount of dividend it will have to give and it is also required to know that whether the borrowings, whether the loan is available for the company or whether the investors are ready to invest into the company? All this analysis has to be done by the company before it decides that how it should go ahead with the rising of the share capital.
Now, if the company decides ultimately that it should raise a share capital then the question arises that whether it should be equity share capital or the preference share capital because these are the two types of share capital which can be raised by the company under the present Companies Act.
And these were the only two types which were there under the 1956, Companies Act also.
Let us now have a look at what is the share capital? So, as I told you that memorandum has a capital clause which has to give the amount of the nominal value of the capital and its division into number of shares.
So, the amount which is authorised by the memorandum, the amount which can be raised by the company which is author memorandum that amount is known as authorised capital.
So, if a companies capital clause writes that company is authorised to raise one thousand crores, So one thou crores will be the authorised capital that can be raised by the company at the time of requirement of any money.
Now, out of this one thousand crore depending upon the need of the company, company can issue issue can go for public issue to have to raise the funds.
Let say the type company decides at present I need 50 percent of the capital so company can go at with public issue of 500 crores.
So, that 500 crores which is issued to the public is known as issued capital of the company.
Now, out of this issued capital every company wants that hundred percent should be subscribe by the public ,so that it is able to raise 500 crore rupees so the portion of the issued capital which is subscribed by the public is known as subscribed capital.
If it is hundred percent then it will be 500 crore if it is 90 percent then it will be accordingly 90 percent of 500 crores.
Now, there is another thing which we need to understand that there is a requirement of minimum subscription which a company has to achieve at the time of public issue.
So, presently the minimum subscription is 90 percent of the issued capital.
Let us now come to the kinds of share capital: the 1956, Act said that a company can issue equity share capital, preference share capital, derivatives and hybrids.
So we’ll take care of the equity share capital and preference share capital in a little while.
First of all let's understand what is a derivative so the Companies Act say the derivative,the same definition which is given by securities contracts Regulation Act of 1956 that will apply to the definition of the derivative.
In hybrid securities will be securities which will have characters of more than two types of securities and including their derivatives also.
But now this act has been repealed so we will not go into the details of this Act.
I will come to the position of 2013 and the under section 43 the Companies Act says that a company can raise equity share capital and preference share capital.
Now what is equity share capital? It says that the capital which is not having all that capital which is not a preference share capital will be known as will be known as equity share capital that means first of all we need to understand what is a preference share capital? The preference share capital is a capital where the shareholders will be having to preferred rights.
What are those two preferred rights? One is preferred right of dividend that is preferential dividend.
Another is that at the time of winding up of the company or repayment of the capital.
The preference shareholders they will have the right of payment.
They will have the first right or the preferred right of payment.
So, all that share capital which has these preferential rights these two of these preferential rights that will be known as preference share capital where as rest of the capital will be known as equity share capital, so that means that equity share capital is ordinary share capital of the company.
Now, there can be two types of equity shares, first equity shares with voting rights second equity shares with differential rights as two voting or dividend or otherwise whatever extra differential rights are given to them.
So, these are two basic types of equity shares which can be issued by the company .
Coming to the preference share capital we know that they have two preferred rights: one is preferential right of dividend and second is preferential right of payment at the time of winding up of the company and at the time of repayment of the capital.
So, these are two rights which are given to the preference shareholders.
Now, section this section 43 of 2013, Act has also talked about deemed preference capital.
Now, what is deemed preference capital? It says that if capital has either of the two rights or both the two rights apart from having their preferential rights which are given to them as the preferential right of dividend and preferential right of repayment at the winding up if any of these two rights are given given to the share capital share holders then that part of the capital will be known as a deemed share capital.
Now, what are the rights? First right is entitlement to dividend that along with the preferential right of dividend if the if the capital is having an entitlement to dividend in the surplus after the payment of dividend has been made in the surplus dividend .
If they are participating, if they are getting this right of entitlement into that dividend then then this will be known as deemed preference capital.
Now, they are participating along with the shareholders or along with the capital which is not having a preferential right of capital.
Now the second right says that they have entitlement to repayment at the time of winding up and this is in addition to the differential right of winding up which there already having.
So, in the case of deemed preference besides having two preferential rights which are given to them under the preference share capital they may have either of these two rights or they may have both of these two rights so then this capital will be known deemed preference capital.
Now, besides that there are two types of preference shares participating and non participating cumulative and non-cumulative.
Now, what are non-cumulative and accumulated shares in participating shares? So, in case of when the company has paid the dividend and surplus dividend is left.
If the preference shareholders they have the right to participate in the surplus dividend or at the time of winding up of the company.
If the preference shareholders they have right to participate in the cash which is left with the company or the assets which is surplus which is left with the company then they are known as participating.
If they do not have this right then their non-participating type.
In case of cumulative preference shares, if in one of the financial years let say company is not able to make any profit and the profit is not paid.
Preferred dividend is not given to the preference shareholders.
If this arrear of non-payment is carried forward to another financial to next financial year where the company is making profit and the preferred dividend is paid to the preference shareholders then the cumulative type of preference shareholders.
That means arrears of non-payment of preferential dividend if it gets carried forward to the next year where the company is making profit and distributing preferential dividend then they are known as cumulative type of preference shares otherwise they are non-commutative type of preference shares.
So, you can understand that when the company is coming up with public issue either of equity shares or of preference shares company has to indicate that what type of equity shares it is issuing to the public or what type of preference shares it is issuing to the public.
Now, there was the third category of preference shares which were known as irredeemable preference shares.
Now we do not have this category anymore with us.
So, there cannot be anything known as irredeemable.
So, this is given under the rules 2014.
Now, if the preference shareholders they agreed to it before 21st year also the preference shareholders they can be redeemed, depending upon the wish of the preference shareholders.
So this is how, we know that every preference share holder has to be a redeemable preference shareholders and the requirement is that only fully paid preference shares can be redeemed half paid or partially paid preferential shares cannot be redeemed.
Now, from where the money for redemption will come? Redemption means that we are paying back the money to the preference shareholders along with the premium if there has to be paid any.
So, the money which can be used by the companies that the company can use its profits which it has collected for dividend which is available for dividend and also out of the proceeds of an early in any any fresh issue which is made only for the purpose of the redemption of the preference shares.
So, two options are there with the company; either to go with the dividend, either to go with the profits which is available with the company for the distribution as dividend or company can have a fresh issue of shares only for the purpose of redemption of the preference shares.
So, in these two options company has to decide which way it want to go ahead with the redemption.
Now, where company is the redeeming preference shares from the profits of the company then the same amount has to be kept by the company in a separate account which is known as capital redemption reserve.
Now, why this capital redemption reserve is required? Because when we are redeeming preference shares we are having a loss of share capital.
Share capital is getting reduced.
We do not want the share capital to be reduce, so that is why the same amount is kept in the capital redemption reserve so that it does not lead to any reduction of the share capital and whatever premium has to be paid that premium can be paid at the time of redemption from the either from the profits of the company or from the securities premium account.
So, this was in brief about the issue and redemption of preference shares.
Another provision which has been put up by 2013, Act is about deemed redemption.
Now, what is deemed redemption? Let's say that a company has to redeem preference shares worth one crore in this year and company does not have money to repay and company does not want to go for fresh issue of securities maybe companies not sure that it will be able to raise that much of money for redeeming purposes, so both the options and it does not have profits to redeem also.
So, another option which has been given to the companies by the Companies Act, 2013 is that in the form of deemed redemption.
Now, what is that form,that whatever redemption amount has to be paid which is the principal amount the share capital, share value plus the dividend; all that can be redeemed in the form of issuing new preference shares to the company, to the preference shareholders.
So, instead of getting cash they are getting new preference shares of the company.
So, this will be deemed to be as redemption of the earlier preference shares and allocation or allotment of the new preference shares with the shareholders.
And once this year redemption of the preference shares is capital the company is complete the company has to inform to the ROC.
This is the requirement of the Companies Act that ROC should be informed that, that company has redeemed preference shares.
Let us now come to the rights of shareholders and or the members.
So the first most important right is of the voting rights.
Now section 47 talks about the voting rights of the equity shareholders and preference shareholders.
Now equity shareholders have the voting rights which can be exercised by them for all the decisions of the company which a company is entitled to make in the General Meeting of the company .
So the decisions which shareholders which the company has to take in the General Meeting of the company the equity shareholders they have the right to vote in all such decisions and on poll their rights will be in equal in proportion to the shares which they are having in the share capital of the company.
Now about preference shareholders, they have a Right to Vote only on the matters which are related to preference shareholders then they can vote they can exercise their voting rights on the winding up of the company, on the repayment of the company or reduction of the capital.
So whether it is the repayment of the preference share capital or reduction of equity share capital they have the right to vote .
So their right to vote is limited because equity shareholders are having more rights in comparison to the preference shareholder so they become more powerful in the company.
Another voting right which is given to the preference shareholders is that if for 2 years dividend is not paid to preference shareholders then they have the right to vote for all the matters of the company as they are voted by as equity shareholders would .
So this is a very important rights which comes to preference shareholders if they are not given the dividend by the company their preferential dividend by the company for a period of 2 years.
Now the next right is of dividend.
Section 143 is about the dividend.
Every shareholder of the company has the right to claim the dividend from the company,once it is declared by the board of directors and even if it is interim dividend is declared by the board they also have the right to claim this dividend but the difference over here is that once the dividend the yearly dividend is declared by board of directors , it becomes the debt owed by the company, where as interim dividend can be taken back by the company.
After its announcement it can be withdrawn by the company also.
So this is the right of the dividend of the shareholders.
Then third right is, right of to have uniform calls on shares.
So then the company is making calls for collection of uncalled capital of the company then at that point in time, the shareholders they have this right that this call should be uniform for one class of shareholders, so there should not be any discrimination in the case of a particular class of shareholders ,that a few of them are getting they have to give more amount in comparison to rest of them.
So they have the right that call should be uniform call when it is made by the company for one class of shareholders.
Then the third the next point is that they have the right to be paid at the winding up of the company.
So when the winding up starts an official liquidator is appointed and it takes into account of the statement of affairs of the company so first of all he has to pay all the statutory dues of the employees apart from that we are not talking about the statutory dues of the employees but first of all he has to pay out all the the creditors of the company.
So all the shareholders, they have the right to be paid at the time of winding up of the company.
Now let's come to Section 48 which talks about variation of shareholders rights.
Now if the company is making any change or modifying the rights of the shareholders and consent of those shareholders is required.
So, if there is variation in one particular class of rights of shareholders then they should agree in writing by three fourth majority or a special resolution of that particular class should be passed by the shareholders and then only the company can go ahead with the variation of shareholders right.
So company, on its own discretion cannot make any change in the variation of cannot make or vary the rights of the shareholders of the company.
The next over here if shareholders there are some shareholders who are descending to this variation.
Next is right of participation in the "Annual General Meeting".
Annual General Meeting is the most important meeting of the company which has to be compulsorily held annually as per the provisions of the Companies Act.
Now over here all the shareholders they have the right that they should participate they can participate in the Annual General Meeting because all the decisions are taken in this meeting.
Director's reports is given, Chairman's messages is given, director's responsibility statement, auditor's report is given, annual balance sheet of the company, financial accounts of the company for profit and loss account of the company ; all such information is laid before the shareholders in this meeting.
So shareholders have the right to participate in this meeting and they have the right to get the notice of as per the requirement of the companies Act that they are required to have a notice notifying them about the date,time and the place of the meeting and also the agenda which is the ordinary agenda and the special business at if it has to be transacted at the time of the meeting.
So all this information should be given to the shareholders to participate in the Annual General Meeting of the company.
Next is their rights issue.
Existing shareholders of a company, they have the right to have a first offer towards the further issue of capital.
So if the company is raising capital through the follow on public offering or FPO then the .
first right will be with the existing shareholders that these shares should be offered to them.
If they do not take any of the action in 30 days passes then these shares,they ago in the hands of the board of directors of the company and board of directors of the company they have to now allot these shares in such a manner that it should not be disadvantageous to the company.
It should not be injurious to the interest of the shareholders.
So these two factors have to be taken into consideration by board of directors at the time of issuing these shares.
Next is their right to transfer shares and securities or other interest in the company.
As we discussed that Section 44 says that securities shares or other interest of a shareholder or a member in a company is freely transferable.
So transfer is also one of the rights which is given to the shareholders.
In case of a public company there cannot be any restriction on the free transferability of the shares whereas in the case of a private company, restrictions can be put up by the board of directors of the company or these restrictions have to be written in the articles of the company only then company can restrict this.
The entire process of transfer has to be followed in the case when the transfer he wants to get registered as a shareholder of the company.
This is all about the share capital, its nature and rights and duties of the shareholders.

This is in brief introduction about the Corporate law course.
Welcome to the MOOC's Programme on Corporate Law.
As a part of the mooc's programme on Corporate Law this module is on the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016.
I am Dr. Risham Garg ,I am Assistant Professor of law and also the Research Director of Centre for Transnational Commercial Law in the National Law University, Delhi.
As a part of this Corporate Law, mooc's course is a model module on insolvency and bankruptcy code.
It deals with the Insolvency, Bankruptcy of Corporate persons as well as natural persons.
I will start by giving a brief overview about the module.
The IBC 2016 aims to consolidate the laws relating to insolvency of companies and limited liability entities.
Including limited liability partnership and other entities with limited liability.
Unlimited liability partnerships and individuals presently contained in a number of legislations into a single legislation.
Such consolidation will provide for a greater clarity in law and facilitate the application of consistent and coherent provisions to different stakeholders affected by business failure or inability to pay debt.
Key objectives of an insolvency law.
Although conferee approaches vary.
There is broad agreement that effective and efficient insolvency regimes should aim to achieve the key objective identified in a balanced manner.
Whatever design is chosen for an insolvency law that will meet these key objectives.
The insolvency law must be complementary too.
And compatible with the legal and social values of the society in which it is based and which it must ultimately sustain.
Although, insolvency law generally forms a distinctive regime.
It ought not to produce results that are fundamentally and conflict with the premises upon which laws other than the insolvency law are based.
Introduction an effective insolvency regime critical component of ease of doing business in India.
In India, the legal and constitutional machinery for dealing with debt default has not been in line with Global standards.
The recovery action by predators either through the Contract Act or through special laws such as the recovery of debts due to Banks and Financial Institutions Act, 1993 and the SRFAESI Act, 2002 has not seen desired outcomes.
Similarly, action through the SICA and the winding up provisions of the Companies Act, 1956 have neither been able to aid recovery for lenders nor a restructuring of firms.
Laws dealing with individual insolvency.
The Presidency Towns Insolvency Act 1909 and the Provincial Insolvency Act, 1920 are almost century old.
This has hampered the confidence of the lender.
When lenders are unconfident the debt access for borrowers is diminished.
This reflects in the state of the credit markets in India.
Secured credit by banks is the largest component of the credit market in India.
Now, starting with the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code 2016.
The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code 2016 here in after referred to as the code provides a comprehensive law to deal with insolvency and bankruptcy of corporate entities and natural persons.
This discussion is divided in following sections.
First, the salient features of the IBC 2016.
Second, 4 pillars of institutional infrastructure.
Third corporate insolvency resolution process.
And fourth, the liquidation process.
The statement of objects of the IBC states that code has been in acted to consolidate and amend the laws relating to reorganisation and insolvency resolution of corporate persons, partnership firms and individuals in a time bound manner for maximization of value of assets of such persons.
To promote entrepreneurship ,availability of credit and balance the interest of all stakeholders including alteration in the order of priority of payment of government dues.
And to establish an insolvency and bankruptcy board of India and for matters connected therewith or incidental there to.
The salient features of the IBC 2016 are as follows.
Clear, coherent and speedy process for early identification of financial distress and resolution of companies and limited liability entities of the underlying business is found to be viable.
2 distinct processes for resolution of individuals namely, fresh start and insolvency resolution.
DRT and NCLT to act as Adjudicating Authority and deal with the cases related to insolvency liquidation and bankruptcy process in respect of individuals.
Second, 4 pillars of institutional infrastructure.
The 4 pillars of institutional infrastructure are Insolvency Professionals, Information Utilities, Adjudication and Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India.
Now, Insolvency Professionals are the first pillar of institutional infrastructure.
They are a class of regulated persons.
They would play a key role in the efficient working of the bankruptcy process.
They would be regulated by insolvency professional agencies.
Information Utilities are the second pillar of institutional infrastructure.
These are required to store facts about lenders and terms of landing in electronic database.
This would eliminate delays and disputes about facts when default does take place.
Adjudication, the third pillar institutional infrastructure is an adjudication.
The NCLT will be the forum where firm insolvency will be heard.
And DRTs will be the forum where individual insolvencies will be heard.
These Institutions along with the replied bodies which the NCLT and the DRATs will be adequately strengthens whereasto achieve world-class functioning of the bankruptcy process.
Adjudicator the National Company Law Tribunal.
The Adjudicating Authority in relation to insolvency resolution and liquidation for corporate persons including corporate debtors and personal guarantors thereof is the National Company Law Tribunal here in after referred to as the NCLT.
The Territorial Jurisdiction of the NCLT will be over the place where the registered office of the corporate person is located.
The NCLT before which a corporate insolvency resolution process or liquidation proceeding of a corporate data analysis is pending will also have jurisdiction in the matter of the insolvency resolution or bankruptcy of personal guarantor of such corporate dater.
Civil Court not to have jurisdiction.
No Civil Court or authority has jurisdiction to entertain a nice to talk proceeding in respect of any matter on which NCLT or the NCLAT has jurisdiction under this code.
No Court tribunal or authority shall grant and injunction in respect of any action taken or to be taken in pursuance of any power conferred on the NCLT or the NCLAT under the code.
The Insolvency and Bankruptcy board of India.
The fourth pillar of Institutional Infrastructure is the regulator.
The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India hereinafter referred to as the board with head office in the National Capital Region and offices at other places in India.
The Central Government has the power to designate a financial sector regulator to perform the function still such board is constituted.
Until the board is constituted or a financial sector regulated is designated under section 195.
As the case may be the powers and functions of the board or such designated financial sector regulator including its power to make regulations shall be exercised by the central government.
Constitution of Board of and the selection of members.
There will be Chairperson, 3 ex-officio members from amongst the officers of the Central Government ,not below the rank of Joint Secretary.
And 1 ex-officio member to be nominated by the Reserve Bank of India.
And 5 others to be nominated by the Central Government.
The Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process, Commencement.
The standard to be made for commencement of Insolvency Proceeding is Central to the design of an Insolvency Law.
As the basis upon which insolvency proceedings can be commenced.
This standard is instrumental to identifying the debtors.
That can be brought within the protective anticipatory mechanism of the insolvency law and determining who make an application for commencement whether the debtor, creditor or other parties.
before moving onto the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process.
I would also like to point out that the Insolvency and Bankruptcy code also addresses the insolvency and bankruptcy resolution of the natural persons.
The person’s individuals and also the unincorporated partnership firms.
The Adjudicating Authority for the individuals, persons, natural persons and partnership firms is the DRT, the Debt Recovery Tribunals.
The Debt Recovery Tribunals are set up or are slated to be set up in each and every district of the country.
And as per the provisions in the code they will ensure the process for insolvency and the bankruptcy resolution of the unincorporated persons.
A major element which is provided by the IBC with respect to the natural persons is the process which is called as the first process.
And this process benefits the individuals with a minimum level of income.
The corporate insolvency resolution process commencement.
The standard to ‘We Met for commencement of insolvency’ proceeding is Central to the design of an insolvency law.
As the basis upon which insolvency proceedings can be commenced.
This standard is instrumental to identifying the debtors that can be brought within the protective anticipatory mechanism of the insolvency law.
And determining who make an application for commencement whether the debtor, creditor or other parties.
Trigger point for initiation.
Corporate insolvency resolution process may be initiated under Chapter 2 of the code in respect of a corporate debtor that has committed a default.
The trigger point for initiating the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process is the occurrence of a default.
A default would have occurred when the debtor fails to pay whole or any part or installment of the amount of that that has become due and payable.
Who can initiate the process? The process for initiating corporate insolvency resolution may be initiated by any of the following.
THE financial creditor and operational creditor or the corporate debtor itself.
Commencement by financial creditor.
Application by financial creditor.
A financial creditor may initiate the process either by itself or jointly with other financial creditors by filing an application before the NCLT .
If a default has occurred in respect of a financial that would not only to the applicant financial creditor but to any other financial creditor of the corporate debtor.
Ascertaining existence of debt default by NCLT.
Within 14 days of application by NCLT.
It must acertain the existence of a default from the records of information utility on the basis of other evidence furnished by the financial creditor.
If NCLT satisfied that the default is occurred or the application made by financial creditor is complete.
Or there is no disciplinary proceeding pending against the proposed resolution professional.
It may by order admit such application under SICA.
Admission of a reference midsto BIFR was by way of an administrative act of registration of reference by the registry of BIFR.
Now, an order must be passed by NCLT.
It appears that corporate debtor need not be heard by n NCLT while ascertaining the existence of default.
Date of commencement.
The corporate insolvency resolution process shall commence from the date of admission of the application of financial creditor by the NCLT.
Order of admission of such application shall be communicated by the NCLT to the applicant and corporate debtor and of rejection to the financial creditor within 7 days.
Declaration of moratorium and public announcement.
With regards to creditors 1 of the fundamental principles of insolvency law is that, insolvency proceedings are collective proceedings which required the interest of all creditors to be protected against individual action by one of them.
Many insolvency laws include a mechanism to protect the value of the insolvency a state that not only prevents creditors from commencing actions to enforce their rights through legal remedies.
During some or all of the period of the liquidation or reorganisation proceedings but also suspense actions already underway against the debtors.
Such a mechanism is variously termed as moratorium, suspension or stay depending on the effect of the mechanism.
Moratorium.
The order to declare Moratorium prohibits.
Firstly, the institution of suits for continuation of pending suits or proceedings against the corporate debtors including execution of any judgment, decree or order in any Court of law, tribunal, arbitration panel or any other authority.
Transferring, encumbering, alienating or disposing of by the corporate debtor any of its assets or any legal right or beneficial interest there in.
Any action to foreclose, recover or enforce.
Any security interest created by the corporate debtor in respect of its property including any action under the securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002 or the SRFAESI Act.
The recovery of any property by an owner or lesser where such properties occupied by or in the possession of the corporate debtor.
Exclusion from Moratorium.
The order of Moratorium should not affect supply of essential goods or services to the corporate debtor which shall not be terminated or suspended or interrupted during moratorium period.
This is important to explore resolution of the corporate debtor as a going concern.
Conduct of Corporate Resolution Process by Resolution Professional.
The resolution professional is responsible for the conduct of the entire Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process.
And manage the operations of the corporate debtor during the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process period.
For this purpose, the Resolution Professional has the same powers and must perform same duties as best it or conferred on the interim Resolution Professional.

A resolution applicant may submit a resolution plan to the resolution professional prepared on the basis of the information memorandum.
A resolution plan means a plan proposed by any person for insolvency resolution of the corporate debtor.
As a Going Concern in accordance with part 2 of the code as already mentioned resolution applicant means any person who submits resignation plan to the Resolution Professional.
The Resolution Professional shall examine each resolution plan received by him to confirm that it resolution plan is compliant of the specifications of the code.
Approval of Resolution Plan by the Creators.
A Resolution Plan must be played before the committee of creditors by the Resolution Professional for its approval.
the committee of creditors may approve a resolution plan by a vote of not less than 75 percent of voting shares of the financial creditors.
The resolution applicant may attend the meeting of the committee of creditors in which resolution plan of the applicant is considered.
Approval of the Plan by the NCLT.
If the NCLT is satisfied that the resolution plan as a proof by the committee of creditors meet the requirements of resolution plan under section 30 subsection 2.
It shall by order approve the resolution plan.
The resolution plan approved by the NCLT Shell be binding on the corporate debtor and its employees, members, creditors, guarantors and other stakeholders, involved in the resolution plan.
As a consequence of the order to have approval the Moratorium order passed by the NCLT shall cease to have effect.
Following the order of approval of resolution plan by the NCLT.
The resolution professional shall forward all records relating to the conduct of the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process.
And the Resolution Plan to the board to be recorded in its database.
Time Limit for Completion of Insolvency Resolution Process.
The Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process provided in Chapter 2 must be completed within a period of 180 days from the date of admission of the application.
To initiate such process which is called as the effective date.
The period of 180 days can be extent by NCLT up to a maximum period of 90 days.
Therefore the total period for resolution of corporate insolvency including extended period can be to a maximum of 270 days.
An extension can be granted by the NCLT on an application filed by resolution professional.
Only if instructed to do by resolution passed at the meeting of a committee of creditors by a vote of 75 percent of the creditors.
If it is satisfied that the subject matter the case is such that the corporate insolvency resolution process cannot be completed within the period of 180 days.
Appeals.
Appeal before the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal.

Designs to a prize potentially interested persons that a liquidation order has been passed.
and last the Repeal of Certain Enactments and Savings.
The Presidency Towns Insolvency Act of 1909 .
And the Provincial Town Insolvency Act 1920 are to be repeat.
This concludes this discussion on the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code.
Now, summarising the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code 2016.
The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code is a welcome initiative.
it prior to this code, the Insolvency Laws in India what we found in various statutes.
There were separate statutes for the personal insolvency for natural persons and also the partnership firms.
There were 2 of these acts and which are around 100 of old as far as corporate insolvency is concerned.
There is no provision clearly specifying the insolvency of a corporate person or a company.
What what what the 1956 Companies Act mention was that in failure to pay the debt the company can be wound up.
And most often misused or misapplied or criticized law where relating to the insolvency was the SICA.
So, SICA also involved the insolvency and also the restructuring of the companies.
The other 2 legislations related to insolvency weret the RDDB file Act and the SARFAESI Act, 2002.
But, these 2 legislations also were not able to effectively address the issues of the insolvency and the effective resolution of the companies.
The insolvency and bankruptcy also involves the winding up but also involves the opportunity of restructuring to be provided for by the company.
Apart from the IBC there are other mechanisms under the RBI mechanism which which is the corporate debt restructuring plan.
Which is a informal plan under which the companies can move the RBI for the restructuring of their debts.
Probably the most important aspect with respect to the person insolvency is a fresh start process which has been initiated in this IBC.
In the fresh start process individuals who have debt up to rupees with who have debts and personal assets till rupees 35,000 .
They are given a fresh start and there is a speedy resolution of their disputes.

Hello friends, myself Neha Kapur Assistant Professor at School of Law Galgotia University.
Today, I will be discussing about the SEBI regulations on issue of capital and disclosure requirements, that were passed in the year 2009.
The other parts of the first module will also deal with the promoters contribution in a public issue.
The pricing in a public issue the security requirements that have been laid down for the purpose of promoting or protecting the interest of investors such as the green shoe option application supported by backedamount etc.
The second part of the module which I will be discussing with you will elaborate upon the various kinds of issues laid down by a company through the private placement process as such.
These issues are basically the rights issue, the bonus issue, referential allotment of the securities.
Then qualified institutional placement institutional placement program .
And also In The End of the second module we will be discussing about the SEBI issue of and listing of the Dead securities regulations laid down in the year 2008.
First of all I will tell you a brief about what is the securities market in India.
The securities market in India is classified into two parts, that is the primary market and secondary market.
The primary market basically deals with the new issue segment or the first hand dealing of securities.
The first hand dealing of securities basically is done by a public issue.
That is through an IPO and FPO that is taken out by a company in the market and the secondary issue that is a secondary market consists of the dealings that are done in the second hand of the securities through a stock exchange that is the portion of the second market.
Secondary market the SEBI that is the securities and exchange Board of India regulates both the primary market as well as the secondary market.
First of all I will talk about the learning objectives that are supposed to be fulfilled by this particular module.
The most important objective firstly of this first module is to understand the need for the issue of capital and disclosure requirements and how it protects the interest of investors.
Initially in the year 2000 the SEBI had introduced the disclosure and the investor protection guidelines in the year 2000, which were later on resigned in the year 2009.
And they were replaced by the SEBI ICDR regulations, that is the issue of capital and disclosure requirements 2009.
These guidelines are basically applicable to public issues .
Secondly the rights issue where the aggregate value is 50 lakh rupees or more than thirdly preferential issues, then qualified institutional placement program by a listed issuer and the fourth is issues of Indian depository receipts.
First of all I will explain that what is a public issue, public issue basically is divided or as defined under the ICDR regulations means and IPO or an FPO that is an initial public offer or a further public offer.
Initial public offer is introduced by the company when it tries to first hand deals with the Securities or gives the issue to the people in the market to the investors for their issuance.
Specified securities which have been particularly defined under the ICDR regulations means the equity shares and the convertible debentures that are introduced by the company.
Coming to what is FPO, FPO is basically a further public offer where by a company introduces the shares of the debentures which are left over in the IPO to be introduced to the public for their subscription.
Coming next to what are the common conditions under the ICDR regulations passed in the year 2009.
The common conditions that a prescribed by the regulations are appointment of intermediaries, secondly filing of offer document, opening of issue, underwriting of public issue, dispatch of material, then minimum subscription.
Over subscription, the manner of calls allotment and the last being restriction on further issue etc.
First of all I will be discussing as to what are basically the common conditions that are laid down under this particular Regulation.
The common conditions are primarily are firstly that the company which is a listed company, a listed company basically means a companies that has been listed on stock exchange.
Listed company first of all has to appoint an intermediary in the nature of a merchant banker also in the terminology of the regulations known as a lead merchant banker, which is an intermediary in the securities market.
The lead merchant banker has to approach to the ROC and also has to file to the SEBI 30 days prior to the coming up with the issue the offer document of the securities.
The offer document of the securities is required to be filed 30 days before the coming of the public issue to be laid down by the company.
When we talk about the filing of the offer document.
It basically means that all the disclosures that are required to be done in the issue or in the of a document are required to be disclosed to the SEBI as well as to then ROC.
Secondly the offer document the details of the offer document that the company that is the listed issuer or the company is coming up in the securities market is required to be hosted on the website of the company where by it has to be disclosed.
That these are the disclosure that the company is making that is who is the promoter what is the capital with the company which company is coming up for the investors to subscribe to.
Thirdly, the issuer that is the company also has to disclose the details regarding the agreement that has been done between the issuer and the lead merchant banker including the due diligence certificate.
The due diligence certificate obtained from the debenture trustees and the certificate ensuring the Investors Protection.
Then coming to the specific requirements that have been laid down for a public issue under the ICDR regulations.
The eligibility requirements that have been laid down first of all under the ICDR regulations are that the issue or the public company is required to have the net tangible Assets of at least 3 crore Rupees at the time when the company comes up with a Public issue.
This is very important in the sense that any company coming up with the public issue or with IPO that is an IPO and FPO you should have net tangible assets.
That is the total amount of acids of that particular company should either be of the value of rupees three crore or even more than that.
The eligibility conditions regarding the pricing in a public issue basically provide for that what should be the price of the securities in the IPO or the FPO that the company or the listed company or the issuer has come up with.
The pricing in the public issue can be determined or on the basis of the prices that have been determined by the merchant banker in consultation with the company.
And also they can be determined through the book building process by the help of a book runner.
The prices of the securities are to be classified the prices of the securities can also be determined or can also be different from to the different investors that they are going to be given to.
The price band of the securities can also be decided by the company at the time of deciding or coming up with the public issue.
The next is the promoters contribution.
The promoter basically a person is a promoter of a company ,when he has taken the decisions pertaining to the capital formation or with respect to the functioning or the working of the company.
Basically a person is considered to be as a promoter who is having all the information, the first hand information of the company and regarding the formation of that particular company.
It can also be a promoter group and the ICDR regulations define the term promoter as well as the term promoter group as his relatives including his wife daughter or children etc.
A promoter should contribute in a public issue at least 20% of the post Issue Capital that is required to be obtained from the investors or 20% of the post Issue Capital after the subscription has been done through an IPO.
Regarding the conditions as laid down in the ICDR regulations about safety provisions concerning and IPO.
It is very important for a student of Corporate Law to understand that how the investors in the securities market are to be protected because the main aim of these regulations and these guidelines been laid down by the SEBI is to protect the interest of investors in the securities market.
As they are the people who are subscribing or paying money or providing funds to a particular company through an IPO.
The safety provisions basically mean that how the investor will be protected in the securities market.
First of all, I will be explaining as to what is meant by application supported by blocked amount ASBA is considered to be or in short which is known as ASBA.
It is considered to be as the most important feature now a days in the securities market because all the application money which the investor has to deposit to a particular company for subscribing to the shares of that particular company are to be now only transferred through a bank account of the issuer and of the investor.
And it is ASBA that is application supported by blocked amount is basically defined as an authorization to block the application money in bank account for subscribing to an issue.
It is now mandatory for issued to accept the funds for an issue only through ASBA.
That is application supported by blocked amount.
Secondly we will be discussing the safety net arrangement.
The safety net arrangement basically means or is an arrangement provided by the issuer under which a person offers to purchase the securities from the original resident retail individual allotee at the issue price.
The safety net arrangement has been basically made to ensure the protection of the investors in the securities market subject to disclosures and issuer may provide a safety net arrangement to purchase up to a maximum of 1000 specified securities per allottee within 6 months from the last date of dispatch of security certificate or credit of Demat account.
The third safety provision laid down under the ICDR regulations is the green shoe option.
The green shoe option which is in short also known as GSO.
Then the food safety provision under the regulations talk about underwriting of the shares under writing or basically underwriters are the persons who give a guarantee under the IPO that they will subscribe to the shares of a particular company in case there is the under subscription of the issue or if the securities have not been purchased by the investors underwriters subscribe to that particular issue.
Underwriting is basically a contract that is entered into by a company with persons or institution called underwriters who undertake to take the whole or a part of the open securities.
As may not be subscribed by the public in consideration of a remuneration that is called underwriting Commission.
That underwriting Commission the issuer company has to pay to the underwriters in lieu of which day will pay to the amount of the securities that are not being subscribed by the public.
Next the types of underwriting have been also provided under the company law that is the complete underwriting.
Secondly partial underwriting and the third is firm underwriting.
Complete underwriting basically means when the entire subscription that is remaining or that is left out will be purchased over by the underwriters to a particular issue.
Partial underwriting means that when only a part or a portion of the particular issue has been taken up or has been purchased by the underwriters to that particular IPO.
Firm underwriting basically means that when a firm arrangement has been made for the purpose of subscribing to that particular issued by the underwriters.
Next I will be discussing with the minimum offer to public and reservations etc.
Coming to what is minimum offer to public and reservations.
These guidelines under the ICDR regulations basically talk about as to what will be the minimum offer in a particular IPO that is required to be given to the public and what all has to be reserved in a particular case.
Allocation first of all we will study what is allocation in the book building process.
First of all coming to what is a book building process, a book building process basically means a process whereby the prices of the securities in the market are to be decided by the forces of demand and supply or on the basis of bids that are taken up by the investors on that particular issue.
That is the prices will only be determined on the basis of the bids that have been taken up the pubic and then the company would decide the prices of that the particular security taken now by on an IPO.
The allegation in the book building process students are I have told you.
Its to be classified into three parts, that is the non-institutional investors, the retail individual investors and the qualified intuitional investors as I have already told you the percentage of the issue that is required to be given to all these investors.
Retail individual investors are basically the investors who subscribe to lesser securities in the securities market or are less in number with respect to the securities allotted to them in non-institutional investors and the qualified institutional buyers are basically the people who invest more and they are in the form of mutual funds or debenture trustees or in the form of some insurance companies etc.
These companies and through these funds they have made lot more investment and not only a retail individual investor.
A retail individual investor would basically main a person subscribing to a maximum of hundred securities or shares in a particular company.
Moving ahead as to what are the safety provisions now apart from allocation in the book building process, a public issue should be kept open for a minimum of three number of days that is a minimum of three working days and a maximum of 10 working days.
It is required to be kept open for revision in price bank then secondly the issuer should make a free issue advertisement in English and Hindi national daily newspaper with a white circulation.
Then the thirdly the minimum application value with reference to the issue of securities should be in the range of rupees 10,000 rupees to rupees 15000 the minimum application value basically means that how much amount of money is the minimum amount to which the investors can subscribe to.
Coming to next the allotment of securities to retail individual investor applicants should be on proportionate basis proportionate bases basically hair signifies that calculating the total number of securities and the number of securities that are asked for by an individual investor in comparison to other investors should be decided on a proportionate basis.
the post issue lead banker should ensure that the money is received in respect of the issue are released to the issuer in compliance with the provisions of section 73 of the Companies Act 2013.
The Lead Banker to an issue is basically a bank with whom all the money of that particular issue or the applications that are received by the public are to be kept at, so that they can be later on release to the issuer.
The merchant banker plays a very important role in the securities market in relation to an IPO coming next the last portion of this particular module where we talk about the types of investors in a public issue.
Investors in a particular issue can be broadly classified into two parts that is the retail investors and the other being institutional investor students whenever we talk about the retail investors they are considered to be either individuals or some group of individuals who wish to subscribe or purchase the shares of a particular company .
The retail investor as such is basically an investor who applies or bids for some specified securities for a value of not more than 200000 rupees.
The examples of individual investors are angel investor that is individuals and group and sweat equity investor.
The retail investors can subscribe as per the regulations under the ICDR regulations a minimum of or not more than basically 200000 rupees.
The institutional investors on the other hand are in the form of investment collectives on behalf of companies through Mutual Funds investment trust etc.
Also it includes and anchor investor or a qualified institutional buyer.
Student’s institutional investors now a day play a very important role in the securities market because they are the people who can subscribe to these issues that is an IPO and FPO in a bulk amount.
The institutional investors are basically companies who are pulling it pulling a lot of money together in order to purchase the securities of a particular company Mutual Funds as such are considered to be a pool of investment or a hybrid form of a security.
Whereby a clubbing of the shares debentures and various other securities is done in order to make it more flexible in order to make it more transparent and more manageable regarding Mutual Funds as well .
The SEBI has laid down the SEBI mutual fund regulations whereby the investment in mutual funds are regulated by SEBI.
In the end students I will like to give you a summary of the module which we have covered which is the part 1 of the issue of capital and disclosure requirements issued by SEBI.
In this particular module students we have discussed and we have talked about the specific guidelines that have been laid down by SEBI, when a public company or when a listed public company that is the issuer comes up with a new issue in the securities market,that is by way of an IPO or an FPO.
In this particular module it is very important for you to understand that what are the practical conditions that have been laid down by SEBI when the company comes up with a new issue in the market The new issue in the market was initially regulated only by the provisions of the Companies Act and which was amended in the year 2013 and to which some recent amendments have also been made out and only regulated by the SEBI Act of 1992.
As to the powers being given to SEBI which is the securities and exchange Board of India.
But now these regulations lay down a proper legal and regulatory Framework whereby these companies that is a listed public company or an issuer is asked mandatorily to follow the guidelines with respect to the promoters contribution in that particular issue.
The pricing of the securities in that particular issue as to on the basis of what the price will be decided .
Also the protection of the interest of investors has been given the prime importance in the ICDR regulations.
In the regulations it has been also get in mind that the investors funds are not being underutilized or they are not simply being taken up by the company and not utilized for the purpose which has been specified in the IPO.
These guidelines with respect to the investor protection have been further strengthened by provisions like ASBA that is the application supported by blocked amount.
Students why ASBA is very important is the basic reason that initially the any transaction in the securities market used to take a lot of time in the clearing of the funds as well as the payment of the money to the particular issuer .
But now a days it has been made very simpler by the ASBA facility that is application supported by blocked amount, whereby the issuer has to specify in the IPO or at the time when the IPO is taken by the issuer.
As to this is considered to be that this particular bank will provide the facility of the application supported by blocked amount that is the application which will be made to a particular Bank for the purpose of ASBA.
In addition to this the price stabilization mechanism has also been laid down by way of the green shoe option which is considered to be a very important mechanism.
Whereby the prices of the securities will be decided on the basis of this process .
In this entire green shoe process or price stabilization process a stabilizing Agent will be appointed by a particular issuer and then he will decide the process of the price of the securities.
In addition to this the promoters contribution that is how much amount or how much percentage of money will a promoter contribute in a particular issue .
That is to be also decided or provided mandatorily by the ICDR regulations .
At least 20% of the issue or the price of the securities which have been laid down in that IPO has to be paid by the promoter .
In the last I have also discussed about the types of the investors that are purchasing or who are subscribing to the securities in the market.
The securities are being subscribed most importantly by two kinds of investors That is the retail investors and the second being the institutional investors.
Institutional investors are basically the companies or institution investing by way of mutual funds or by way of the investment trustees, debenture trustees etc.
That is the companies which are investing into the shares and the other being the retail individual investors that is one or two or maybe group of people subscribing to the securities.
In the second module basically students will be discussing about how the private placement of the securities takes place .
The most basic difference between the private placement of securities and the public issue being that in a public issue the securities are offered to the public at large by way of an IPO or an FPO ,whereas in the private placement of the securities they are being given only to a limited number of people that is to a maximum of 50 people in the securities market.
That is to a maximum of 50 investors in the market.
And they can be basically done by a qualified institutional placement program and institutional placement program etc these will be elaborated in the second module.
I hope the students who are going to this particular module will be able to learn more about the functions of SEBI, because as such the SEBI that is the securities and exchange Board of India, which is the regulator of the securities market has been regulating the market.
The primary and the secondary market which is the classification of our securities market in India by the SEBI Act of 1992 by detailing the functions and the various offences and the various provisions laid down under the SEBI Act, but by these specific regulations the role of SEBI has been further strengthen to keep an eye and to keep a watch on how the companies or how the public companies are to subscribe or to get funds from the people or investors in the market.
Hello Students!
Now we will be discussing about the second module of the ICDR regulations laid down by SEBI in the year 2009.
The Part 2 of this particular regulation will be discussing the issue of a rights issue done by the company that is a public listed company or the issuer.
Then the bonus issue, then qualified institutional program or institutional placement program.
Then issue of Indian depository receipts by the company and in the end we will be also discussing about the issue and listing of debt securities regulations laid down by SEBI in the year 2008.
Students, till now whatever we have discussed in the ICDR regulations talks only about the public issue or the conditions that have been laid down by the ICDR regulations in the case of a public issue that is an IPO on an FPO you taken up by the company.
Now what we will be discussing in the path two of the regulations is basically the placement program that is to be instituted by the issuer in case of private placement of the securities.
Students, it is a very important for you to understand that the difference between a public issue and a private placement of the securities.
The private placement of securities is only a process whereby a selected group of people that is only 50 persons as such to a maximum are given a subscription of a particular securities of the company.
The Companies Act, under Section 23 lays down that a public company can subscribe or get a subscription to the securities of the company either through a public issue that is through an IPO or an FPO or through a private placement of the securities.
The Private placement of the securities can also be done by a public company but in case of a private company it can only come out with the subscription through private placement only.
The private placement process is completely different from the public issue of securities.
Coming to students, the objectives first of all, in this particular module the objective of our study is to understand the conditions and the requirements for various kinds of issues and as well as the conditions and the requirements that are laid down under the regulations for a rights issue, a bonus issue, a QIP that is a Qualified Institutional Placement, institutional placement program, IDRs Etc.
Second objective, students will be to understand the meaning and the features of the rights issue, bonus issue, and the QIP institutional placement program IDRs etc.
The third objective of this particular module will be to understand the conditions and the eligibility requirements that have been laid down under the SEBI issue and listing of debt securities regulations 2008.
These regulations have also been laid down by SEBI which talk about the issue and the listing as well as the continuous listing of the debt securities.
Just as a reference here, students I would tell you that debt securities basically mean the securities which are issued by the company in pursuance of a convertible instrument or a debt instrument that is given by the company to the subscribers or the investors.
Coming to first of all the introduction, the regulatory framework of the securities market in the primary market consists of the issue of securities not only through an IPO or an FPO but it also consists of an issue through our rights issue, bonus issue, private placement etc.
The main elements relating to these issues are laid down under ‘The Companies Act’ of 2013 and the SEBI ICDR regulations of 2009.
The conditions and regulatory requirements relating to such issues have been laid down under the ICDR regulations.
The regulations provide a framework to protect the interest of investors by specifying the mandatory disclosures and the manner of such disclosures.
It also provides for other modes of raising capital by a public company which is neither a public issue nor a right issue but by way of private placement of the securities.
The private placement can be basically divided into three important parts that is a preferential allotment, a Qualified Institutional Placement and Institutional Placement Program.
Then in order to regulate the issue of the debt securities that is debenture or bonds, the regulations on issue and listing of debt securities 2008 have been issued by SEBI.
These regulations provide for conditions to be fulfilled by an issuer while issuing and listing the debt securities either through a public offer for a private placement basis on a recognized stock exchange.
In this, it is very important for a student of Corporate Law to understand that in case of the debt securities whereby the issuing and listing of debt securities is to be done.
It can either be done through a public offer or also through a private placement of the securities on a recognized stock exchange.
Now, students coming first of all the main content of this particular module.
In this module, you will understand first of all the rights issue.
Rights issue basically means an issue of the securities to existing shareholders as on a particular date that is the record date fixed by the issuer.
Students, it is very important to understand that a rights issue is only an issue that is done to the existing investors of a particular company.
All the people who have already subscribed to the securities of the company are given some additional shares by way of a rights issue.
Whereas as in the case of an IPO which we have discussed earlier in the first module the shares were first time to be given to the investors.
Whereas in the case of a rights issue it is considered to be an issue of the securities to the existing shareholders as on a particular date.
For the purpose of determining that particular date by the issuer that is a listed public company.
It is considered to be as the record date in terms of the guidelines.
The rights, in this case the rights issue are offered to the existing shareholders in a particular ratio to the number of securities held as on the record date.
It is very important for you to understand that this particular ratio is to be decided by the issuer only that in which particular ratio, the rights are to be given to the existing shareholders to the particular shareholders of the investors, in other words.
The company offers existing shareholders a right to purchase additional shares at a price lesser than the market price.
The price in case of rights issue is considered to be lesser than the price at which the securities of shares are being given to the public.
In a rights issue to the price determined by the issue will always be lesser than the price which is determined by the market.
A share holder has an option of applying for additional shares but the final decision would rest with the board of directors of a particular company.
Next, coming to the general conditions relating to the rights issue.
A rights issue can be offered through a letter of offer where the aggregate value of the securities offered exceeds Rs.50 lakhs.
As such, in case of a rights issue it should either be an issue been given to the public either for a value of Rs.50 lakhs or more than 50 lakhs.
So the first general condition with respect to rights issue provides us that it can be offered through a letter of offer that is an offer document given to the public or to the investors.
In case, the value exceeds Rs 50 lakhs, then the draft letter of offer has to be filed SEBI through a merchant banker at least 30 days prior to filing it with the designated stock exchange.
The letter of offer or the draft letter of offer basically is the offer document which is considered to be as the prospectus detailing out the terms and conditions that are required to be provided to the investors of a rights issue.
The terms and conditions are basically the prerequisites which are required or which the company on the basis of which will be issuing the securities to investors of the rights issue.
The draft letter has to be filed to the SEBI by way of a merchant banker at least 30 days prior to filing it with the designated stock exchange.
The designated stock exchange, students is considered to be as a platform, stock exchanges a platform where the securities of a company are listed for them to be dealt with in the secondary market and a designated stock change basically means one of the stock exchange where the company is going to list the securities.
A rights issue cannot be made unless form arrangements of Finance through verifiable means towards 75% of the state it means of Finance have been made.
Why it is very important for you to understand this provision students is that until and unless 75% of the form arrangements have been made for financing that particular rights issue, it cannot be offered to the existing shareholders.
Basically, it is providing a minimum cap on a particular issue of being subscribed of finance been provided for that particular issue in case of a rights issue to already being made by the issuer that is the company.
Then the issue shall be open for subscription for a period of 15 days and a maximum period of 30 days.
It is again important for the issuer to ensure that the rights issue remains open for a minimum period of 15 days and a maximum period of 30 days.
It is important to ensure that the issue that the investors or the subscribers get at least 15 days in case they wish to subscribe to the rights issue of that particular company.
Next are, students the specific conditions are the particular eligibility requirements in case of a rights issue.
The eligibility requirements for specific conditions have been classified into four important parts.
The first being the record date.
Secondly, being the letter of offer, then the abridged prospectus and third being the advertisement on the pre issue advertisement that is required to be made by the company and fourth being the restriction on rights issue.
Firstly, I will be discussing as to what is the meaning of the term record date.
Record date basically, students is the date or a particular date on which the issuer order public listed company is coming out with that particular issue.
The issuer making rights issue has to announce a particular date existing on which the eligible securities or the eligible shareholders will be allotted the rights issue.
The issuer it is very important that the issuer shall not withdraw rights issue after the announcement of the record date has been done and if it does so then it cannot withdraw or if it does so it cannot make an application for listing do securities for a period of 12 next month’s basically.
Again, why this time period has been laid down students is to make sure that the record date which has been decided by the issuer in case of a rights issue is not changed time and again by that particular issuer.
If the particular issuer is changing the record date or if there is any kind of change being done by the issuer then it cannot issue the same securities by way of a rights issue for a period of next 12 months.
The second requirement for the conditions laid down for the rights issue is restriction on the rights issue.
A rights issue of equity shares cannot be made if the issuer has outstanding fully or partly convertible debt instruments at the time of making rights issue.
It basically signifies, students that any issuer coming up with the rights issue should not have any kind of fully or partly convertible debt instruments that are pending or to be made at the time to be paid by that particular issued at the time of coming up with the rights issue.
If the issuer has got any of such instruments which are fully or convertible debt instruments that is an instrument which signifies the amount of debt to be paid by that particular company.
If that is there at the time it cannot come up with the rights issue.
Then next is the next eligibility conditions provides for letter of offer pricing and the period of subscription.
The letter of offer along with application form shall be sent to all existing shareholders at least 3 days before the opening of the issue.
Here, it basically signifies students that the letter of offer on the basis of which the issuer is coming up with the rights issue should be given to all the existing shareholders at least 3 days before the date of coming up of the rights issue.
Secondly, the issue price shall be decided before determining the recorded in consultation with the designated stock exchange.
The issue price here signifies students, the price of that particular issue or the price of the securities that are to be given by way of a rights issue.
It has to be decided on consultation with the designated stock exchange.
Then the issuer shall give only 1 of the following payment options to the investors in case of a rights issue, the part payment on application shall not be less than 25% of the issue price and the part payment on application with balance money to be paid in calls.
This signifies that the issuer will have to provide a condition under the rights issue that at least 25% of the amount of money that is to be paid ,can be paid partly and later on the rest can be paid up.
Then full payment on application, if such issue has obtained the necessary regulatory approvals.
That is full payment from the investors or the subscribers of rights issue will be taken by the issuer.
If all the necessary regulatory approvals have already been taken by that particular issuer.
The pre-issue advertisement of the rights issue provides that the following disclosures are required to be made by the issuer of the rights issue.
That is, the first being the date of completion of the dispatch of abridged letter of offer and application form.
Then a statement that the application form can also be directly sent to the issuer by the existing shareholders through the registered post with application money to the issuer.
Then the advertisement shall be made at least in one English and in Hindi daily newspaper and in one regional news paper in that particular area where the company is situated so as to ensure that the advertisement is circulated to all the existing shareholders of that particular company.
It is very important students for the company to disclose that rights issue is been given to the existing shareholders because it is a important opportunity that is being given to the existing shareholders to subscribe to the securities of the additional securities of that particular company.
Next, I will be elaborating about the bonus issue.
Students, first of all you should know what is the most important difference between the rights issue and the bonus issue?Before I start with the bonus issue, it is very important to understand that what is meant by a bonus issue and the basic difference between the 2.
A rights issue is given as I have already told you, is given to the existing shareholders on a particular record date.
The shareholders which was existing on a particular record date on the particular ratio that is being applied by them on the basis of the price that is decided by the company and which is paid by the investors or the existing shareholders.
Whereas students, in case of a bonus issue the thing is that the existing shareholders are given a particular issue of the securities out of the free reserves Auto Share Premium Account of a particular company.
A bonus issue as the term itself suggest, students is basically a issue which is given in addition to the number of the securities that are being held by the existing shareholders of that particular company.
The bonus issue can be defined as an issue of securities to the existing shareholders made by an issuer on a record date without any consideration from the shareholders.
The price of the securities, the price of that particular issue is the most important difference existing between the rights issue and bonus issue.
In case of the rights issue the price is to be paid up by the existing shareholders and on the basis of the price decided by the issuer.
Whereas in case of a bonus issue, it is considered to be that no prices to be paid by the issuers by the existing shareholders of that particular issuer because they are given without any consideration.
They are in addition to the existing shares which are there with the existing shareholders.
The shares are issued in case of bonus shares.
They are issued out of the free reserve or share premium account of a company in a particular ratio to the number of securities held on a record date.
To the number of securities here signifies that the number of shares that are held by the existing shareholders ,they are given securities out of the free reserves of that particular company.
Coming next to the Features of the Bonus Issue.
Bonus issue is basically a conversion of capital of the company to another.
When we say that it is a conversion of capital to another, it basically means that the capital of the company which was existing with the company as it is in the form of free reserves or in the form of profit of that particular company are being subscribed or being given as shares in the form of bonus issue to the existing shareholders.
Secondly, the total resource base of a company is not altered due to the issue of bonus share.
There is no scope of money mobilization from investors into capital structure of a company in the primary capital market.
They are issued by converting the reserves of the company into equity share capital.
Students, equity share capital basically signifies the amount of the capital out of the total share capital of the company which is given for subscription to the people or to the investors.
In case of Bonus and rights issue, it is the existing shareholders of the company.
It can be issued only if the articles of association of a particular company authorize it.
Students, the articles of association of a particular company is basically the most important document because it is the document that signifies that how the internal management or the management of the affairs of the company has to be done.
If the A.O.A of the company signify or provide for such a provision that the bonus issue of the shares can be done only then it can be done by the board of directors of that particular company.
Now, students you will study the conditions for the bonus issue.
The conditions for bonus issue first of all provide that the articles of association of the company must authorized for such a bonus issue and if it is not authorized then the company shall pass a special resolution and the General Body Meeting of the company.
Secondly, it is important that the issuer must not have defaulted in the payment of interest or principal or the fixed deposits or the dead securities issued by it.
Thirdly, the issue has not defaulted in the payment of the dues of the employees which are the mandatory dues like the provident fund, gratuity, etc.
These conditions basically students, provide that when a bonus issue is being issued by the issuer to the existing shareholders, these all obligations of the company should not have been existing on that particular date.
If any kind of obligation with respect to payment of money like gratuity or other employee benefits have not been given by the issuer to the existing share to their employees then it is not permitted for the company to come up with the bonus issue.
Second, the restriction of the bonus issue, the issuer should have should not have fully or partly convertible debt instruments at the time of making the bonus issue.
Secondly, the bonus issue shall be made out of the free reserves that are existing in the company or which are also can be the genuine profits or out of the securities premium collected in cash only that is the free reserves or the securities premium and the bonus shares shall not be issued in lieu of dividend.
In lieu of dividend, basically signifies students, that the dividend is given to the existing shareholders on the number of the shares that is held by them in that company.
If the bonus shares are been given out of the dividend that is being given it is not permitted for the company to do that.
The third condition for a bonus issue is the completion of the bonus issue.
The issuer announcing a bonus issue after the approval of its board of directors shall implement the bonus issue within 15 days from the date of the approval and once the decision to make a bonus issue is announced the issue cannot be withdrawn.
The bonus issue, it is very important that it cannot be withdrawn after it has been announced by the company and it must be also implemented within 15 days from the date when it is approved by the existing board of directors of the company.
In the third part, students, we will be discussing about Private Placement- Concept and Types.
As I have already discussed and told you in the first module that a private placement of the securities means the issue of securities to unlimited number of persons that is a maximum of 50 persons and which is the opposite of a publication issue.
The private placement refers to issue of the shares made by a company to a select group of investors instead of inviting the public at large.
It is basically of three types that is a preferential allotment, secondly qualified institutional placement and the third is institutional placement program.
A preferential issue means a issue of the specified securities to specified persons or group of persons on a private placement basis.
It is considered as a fresh allotment of the shares to promoters, their friends and relatives on a preferential basis, other than raising capital through a public issue, rights issue or a bonus issue.
Coming next to the conditions for a preferential issue.
In order to make sure that the I.C.D.R regulations have been fulfilled, the issuer has to abide or follow the basic conditions for preferential issue laid down under the guidelines.
First of all, a special resolution must be passed by the shareholders of a listed issuer for issuing preferential issue.
Secondly, allotment pursuing to the special resolution shall be completed within a period of 15 days from the date of passing of such resolution or thirdly all the equity shares held by the proposed allottees in the issuer must be in a dematerialized form.
Students, the dematerialize form basically means that the securities must be in a fungible and in an electronic form.
The electronic form here signifies that the securities now are to be mandatorily kept in a electronic form under the depositories act of 1996 and no hard copy of the securities should be there.
Then the issuer must be in compliance with the conditions for continuous listing of equity shares as specified in the listing agreement with the recognized stock exchange where the equity shares are listed.
Next, coming to what is a Qualified Institutional Placement? The Qualified Institutional Placement is basically a placement of the securities that is done to a limited number of people.
The features of a Qualified Institutional Placement are- the aggregate of the proposed QIP and all previous QIPs made by the issuer in the same financial year shall not exceed 5 times the net worth of the issued as per the audited balance sheet of the previous financial year.
Secondly, the tenure of the convertible or exchangeable eligible securities issued through QIP shall not exceed 60 months from the date of allotment.
Then the eligible securities allotted under QIP shall not be sold by the allottee for a period of 1 year from the date of allotment except on a recognized stock exchange.
Fourthly, the minimum number of allottees for each placement of eligible securities made under QIP shall not be less than 2.
And lastly, where the issue size is less than or equal to 250 crore rupees, five, where the issue size is greater than 250 crore rupees and no single allotment has been allotted shall be allotted more than 50 percent of the issue size.
Conditions for the qualified institutional program have been laid down under the ICDR regulations as follows.
A special resolution approving the QIP must have been passed by the shareholders of the listed issuer.
Secondly, allotment shall be completed within a period of 12 months from the date of passing of the resolution.
The equity shares proposed to be allotted through QIP must have been listed on a recognised stock exchange having nationwide trading terminal for a period of at least 1 year prior to the date of issuance of the issue.
Then, it must be incompliance with the requirement of minimum public shareholding specified in the listing agreement with the stock exchange.
Then, the QIP shall be made on the basis of a placement document which I’ll contain all material information.
Lastly a copy of the placement documents shall be filed with the SEBI for its record within 30 days of the allotment of eligible securities.
Next we will be discussing students about the Institutional Placement Program.
An Institutional Placement Program means a further public offer of eligible securities by an eligible seller in which the offer allocation and the allotment of such securities is made only to the qualified institutional buyers.
It is very important for you to understand students that, in a Institutional Placement Program only the QIBs that is the Qualified Institutional Buyers are further given the securities of that particular company.
You can say that it is an extension of the qualified institutional placement program that has been done by the company.
The important conditions for an IPP that is in Institutional Placement Program are that it must have been made only after passing a special resolution by the shareholders of the issuer in terms of section 63 of the Companies Act 2013.
Secondly, no partly paid up securities shall be offered.
Thirdly, the issuer shall obtain and in principle approval from the stock exchange.
Coming next to what is the meaning of an Indian Depository Receipt? An Indian Depository Receipt means an instrument in the form of a depository receipt created by a Domestic Depository in India against the underlying equity shares of the issuing company incorporated outside India.
Basically, in case of an Indian Depository receipt, it is a receipt which is created by the domestic depository as provided.
Domestic Depository is also a company provided under the depositaries act of 1996 and created against the underlying equity shares of the company incorporated outside India that is a foreign company not incorporated in India.
Next are the conditions for an IDR that is an Indian Depositary Receipt.
The following are students, the conditions for an idea.

Secondly, the procedure to be followed in each class of applicant should already be sanctioned in the prospectus.
Thirdly, there should only be one denomination of the idea at a particular time.
Next, the minimum application amount should be rupees 20,000.
And lastly, at least 50 percent of the issue should be allotted to the QIBs on proportionate basis.
The balance 50 percent among categories of non institutional or retail individual investors.
In the last part of the module, will be discussing about the SEBI issue and listing of debt securities regulations of 2008.
As the name suggest, the SEBI has made this regulations with regard to issue listing and the continuous listing of debt securities.
The regulations basically define debt securities laid down issue requirements for public issues such as disclosures in of a document filing of prospectus etc.
They also provide for listing of debt securities conditions for continuous listing and trading of the debt securities as well as the obligations of intermediaries and the issuers.

Thirdly the issuer has obtained credit rating from at least one SEBI registered credit rating agency which should be disclosed in the offer document.
And fourthly, the issuer has entertained or has already entered into an arrangement with a SEBI registered depository for their dematerialization.

I’m Deepika Prakash, from National Law University Delhi and this presentation is about other laws effecting companies under the Corporate Law.
This presentation will elaborate on laws other than Companies Act 2013 ,which have an impact on the companies that function in India.
The major focus of this presentation is to give an overview of all such laws and their respective provisions which have a consequence on the functioning of a company form of organization in India.
Company form of organization is by far one of the most ingenious and successful business organizations worldwide.
Over the years it has taken complex forms evolved to suit the needs and objectives of various businesses while maintaining its basic characteristics like, limited liability and perpetual succession.
Which are one of the appealing features as compared to other forms of business organizations like sole proprietorship and partnership? The history of regulating companies in India starts with the Joint Stock Company Act of 1850, which was subsequently replaced by the Act of 1857 more in line with the English Companies Act of 1855.
The first comprehensive Indian Companies Act was passed in the year 1866, which was amended on several occasions.
Subsequently, based on the Bhabha Committee report India passed the act of 1956.
Now, as corporate India continues to evolve at a lightning speed it is imperative that all the diversion Ranger stock whole stakeholders in it a well protected and represented.
In India company form of business in all its kinds are primarily regulated by the Companies Act 2013, which has recently substituted its predecessor that is the act of 1956.
The new act deals with various dimensions of companies giving detailed provisions for the regulation and compliance and raised the bar on governance.
However, companies in India are regulated by other diverse laws as well and the intertwining of these laws create a dynamic structure of regulations which makes corporate environment more transparent simple and globally acceptable.
Some of these laws are, the Banking Regulation Act of 1949, the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act 1992, the Securities Contract Regulation Act of 1956, the securitisation and reconstruction of financial assets and enforcement of securities interest act of 2002, the competition Act of 2002, the Foreign Management Exchange Act of 1999, the Insurance Act 1938, the Income Tax Act of 1961, then there are various labor laws, various Intellectual Property Rights, various environmental laws and finally the latest law the limited liability Partnership Act of 2008.
Let us briefly discuss them.
The first law that affects companies in India is the Banking Regulation Act of 1949.
It is the main law regulating banking in India.
However, this Act does not purport to codify the law on banking.
It merely lays down the regulations for the functioning of the banking companies and cooperation.
In addition to those already presented in the Companies Act.
Now, there are three types of banks in India.
First, are the Nationalised banks, like the State Bank of India and the Bank of Baroda.
Second, other banking companies which include private banks like ICICI and HDFC.
It also includes foreign banks, like, Citibank and finally there are cooperative banks, like; the Cosmos Bank.
Now, what does banking mean? The business of Banking in India means that the Bank must have three features: first, the ability to receive money as deposits, second, the ability to honor customer’s cheque and thirdly, ability to grant loan.
If a company does not carry out all these functions then it will not be called a bank.
The part two of the Banking Regulation Act of 1949, defines and Lays down the business of banking companies.
Section six elaborates on various forms of business in which such companies may engaging.
Few such activities are: first, borrowing raising or taking up of money, the lending or advancing of money either upon or without security.
Second, bills of exchange, hundies, promissory notes, coupons, draught, bill of lading, Railway receipts, warrants and other instruments and securities weather transferable or negotiable or not .
Third, providing a safety deposit vault, the collecting and transmitting of money and securities .
Fourth, the effecting, ensuring, guaranteeing, underwriting, participating, in managing and carrying out of any issue public or private companies.
Now, the act further lays down rules regarding appointment of board of directors and the chairman, licensing of a banking company; its capital, its loans and advances and the Reserve Bank of India’s power on banking company to name of you.
Therefore a company which is interested in starting banking functions must be well worth with these regulations.
Now, the Securities and Exchange Board of India is constituted in accordance with the provisions of the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act of 1992.
The Act states the functioning of SEBI to be first to protect the interest of investors in the security market, to protect the development off, and to regulate the security market itself.
Therefore SEBI is the regulator of the securities and exchange market of India.
The Act is divided generally into various chapters and these chapters mostly deal with the establishment of SEBI, the powers and functions of the board, prohibition of manipulation and deception devices, insider trading and provisions regarding substantive acquisition of securities.
The Act also lays down penalties for the contravention of the act, SEBI’s power of adjudication and establishment jurisdiction as well as procedure for the securities appellate tribunal.
Now, moving on to another law, the Securities Contract Regulation Act 1956 is another vital legislation which is applicable and effects companies in India where the securities are listed on stock exchanges.
The object of the Act is to prevent undesirable transactions in securities by regulating the business of dealing in it.
The Act lays down provisions for creation and recognition of stock exchanges, contracts in securities and listing of securities in stock exchanges.
The aim is to keep the functioning of the stock market transparent and to prevent undesirable contract in security market through due process of recognition and continued supervision.
Now, this Act can be measured divided into two parts: first, relates to recognising of stock exchanges and second, relating to penalties and procedure under the Act.
Coming to another law, which is the great significance to a company in India is the Competition Act 2002.
This Act replaced the monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Act of 1969 and as it was found to be insufficient with the needs of the growing Indian economy after liberalization.
The Act has objects: as first, to prevent practices having adverse effect on the competition, second to promote and sustain competition in the market, third to protect the interest of consumers and fourth to ensure freedom of trade in the market.
The Act establishes the Competition Commission of India and its function is to regulate three aspects regarding competition.
They are: first, prohibition of certain agreement under section three of the competition Act 2002.
Under this provision any agreement made by an enterprise or group which is made in respect of production, supply, distribution, acquisition or control of goods of provisions of services which causes or is likely to cause an appreciable adverse effect within India is prohibited.
Such agreements are called anti-competitive agreements.
Second regulation is regarding abuse of dominance under section 4.
This provision prohibits abuse of dominant position by any enterprise or group which will have an appreciable adverse effect on the market, and final is a regulation of combinations under Section 5 as well as section 6 of the company of the competition Act 2002.
Under it mergers and acquisitions which made the specified turnover or asset based test laid down in the Act itself ,have to be notified so as to regulate them from hampering the competition in the market.
Coming to another law which a company operating in India messed adhere to is the Foreign Exchange Management Act 1999.
Now, this Act was enacted to basically promote the foreign exchange market in India.
It repealed the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act of 1963.
By this new law a paradigm shift has occurred in the Foreign Exchange Policy of India.
Earlier, it was about control and regulation of all external transaction.
But now, it has been replaced to management of the foreign exchange for better capital inflow.
Now, FEMA Act of 1999 lays down rules regarding dealings in foreign exchange, holding a foreign exchange, foreign securities and any immovable property outside India, current and capital account transaction in foreign exchange through a person authorise under the act, export of goods and services, realisation and repatriation of foreign exchange to mention a few.
Now, the Act further lays down certain penalties for the contravention of the above rules.
Now coming to another law; the business of insurance is regulated in India under the Insurance Act of 1938.
The companies which are engaged in providing insurance have to comply with the provisions under this act.
This is a comprehensive Act relating to matters of insurance company.
Now, this tax is levied on the strength of an Act called the Income Tax Act, which was passed by the Parliament of India in the year 1961.
The income tax Act is one of the core laws, which every company in India has to comply with.
Now, the income earned in India is not limited to Income earned within the geographic limits or the boundaries of the country.
Certain incomes are also Deemed to have been earned in India although they may have been and outside the country.
The Income Tax Act lays down various rules relating to resident, for the purpose of taxes in India, special tax provisions for SEZs, deductions, computation of total income as well as offences under the Act and penalties for contravention of the rules.
It also establishes a tax income tax authority for carrying out the provisions under this Act.
Hence, a company in India also has to be aware of the Income Tax Act.
Now, India introduced a new form of business organisation by the enactment of the Limited Liability Partnership Act 2008.
An LLP of the Limited Liability Partnership combines the flexibility of a partnership and the advantages of limited liability of a company at a low compliance cost.
LLP therefore provides its members the flexibility of organising the internal management on the basis of a mutually arrived agreement as it is in the case of a partnership firm.
The LLP form of business vehicle is useful for small as well as medium enterprises.
Now, the main features of the Limited Liability Partnership Act of 2008 can be briefly state to be firstly, the Indian Partnership Act is not applicable to LLPs.
Second, the LLP has a body corporate and a separate legal entity from its partners.
Third, the mutual rights and duties of partners inter see in an LLP and those rights and duties.
The LLP and partners are governed by an agreement of provisions under the Limited Liability Act of 2008.
Fourthly, every LLP must have two partners and two individuals as designated partners of whom at least one must be a resident in India.
Therefore, any company or LLP must be well versed and comply with this Act of 2008.
Now, another set of laws that a company specially and industry must comply with other countries labor laws.
These labor legislations regulate various aspects of the relationship between employers and employees in an industry.
It regulates the health and safety of its workers, minimum employment requirements, employees rights to name a few.
It is important for the corporate India to be aware of these labor legislation as they have direct consequence on the working and regulation of the company.
The term ‘labor’ here refers to any productive work especially physical work done for wages.
I will discuss now very briefly the main labor laws in India.
The very first and most important labor legislation is an Industrial Dispute Act of 1947.
The statement and object of this act, is to make provisions for the investigation and settlement of industrial disputes.
The Industrial Dispute Act of 1947 was enacted to make provisions for investigation and settlement of industrial disputes and for providing certain safeguards to the Act work.
The Act contains about 40 sections which deal with defining an industry, industrial dispute; lay off, lockout, retrenchment, trade union, strike, wages and workmen.
It provides machinery for investigating and settlement of disputes through works committee, conciliation officers Board of Conciliation, courts of enquiry, labor courts, tribunal and voluntary arbitration.
It also lays down provisions for reference of dispute for adjudication.
Payment of wages to workers; during pendency of proceedings in the High Court are also dealt with under the Industrial Dispute Act.
Then, what are the rights of appeal, settlement in or outside conciliation, notice of change in employment conditions, protection of workmen during the pendency of preceding, strike and lockout procedure, lay off compensation, retrenchment compensation, proceedings for retrenchment and various penalties for contravention of the provisions under this Act.
Now, another important legislation is the employees State Insurance Act of 1948.
This is a social welfare legislation, enacted by the parliament to achieve the socio-economic justice and strength in the Directive Principles of State Policy under the constitution of India.
Its primary purpose is to provide relief to the employees in case of maternity, injury during the course of employment as well as a time of sickness.
In such situations, employees receive medical relief, cash benefits, maternity benefits, dependence of deceased workers; receive pension and compensation for fatal other injuries and diseases.
It also establishes the employees State Insurance Corporation.
Now coming to another labor welfare legislation.
It is the Workman Compensation Act of 1923.
The Worksmen Compensation Act 1923 aims to provide workman as well as the dependent, reliefs in case of accidents arising out of an in course of employment which has caused the death or disablement of workman.
This Act is to be noted does not cover workers under the Employees State Insurance Act.
The reason for exclusion is that they are already covered under the SEPRO Act.
Now, let’s see some of the main provisions of the workmen compensation Act of 1923.
The Act deals with defining of a workman, disablement then under what circumstances employer is liable to compensate, provisions regarding accidents arising out of and in course of employment and provisions regarding the amount of compensation to be paid in various circumstances.
Now, the final labor law that we will look at today is a factories Act 1948.
The primary object of the Act is to secure safety measures in the factories for the health and welfare of its workers as well as create a system of approval method for starting of factories.
The major provisions this Act can be said to be: first that the Act defines what factories are? Then, it lays down safety and health measures, it lays down working hours, what are the overtime wages because of workman, facilities; which are to be provided in large factories, provisions on women factory workers, rules of employment of children in factories and also how to deal with, with hazardous processes in a particular factory.
Coming to another set of interesting laws that a company engaged in creation of Intellectual Property Right or the IPR, the laws relating to IPRs to such companies a very crucial.
These are rights granted to the creator, a owner of works which are results of human intellect and creativity.
This could be literary, musical, software, industrial, brand names or scientific.
World Trade Organization is the primary international body in the field of IPR.
It has laid down standards to be followed by its member nations on the following areas: first is the patent, second is the trademark, third copyright then there is geographical indication, industrial designs, layout designs and integrated circuits and plants varieties.
Let us look at a few main laws out of these that have been established in India.
First is the Patent Act of 1970.
Patents are exclusive rights granted to the owner of an invention.
These rights include right to create, use and market these inventions in India.
These rights imply that no one else can manufacture, use or market the same products for the period which the patent has been granted.
This Act lays down the procedure for application and grant of patent and other matters connected to it.
It also creates a controller of Patents as well as patent offices in various places in India.
The Act also lays down issue compulsory licenses.
Now the second and important intellectual property right law is that ‘The Trademark Act’.
The Trademark Act of 1999 is something that a company must be aware of under which ,any sign or any combination of science capable of distinguishing the goods or services of any one undertaking from those of other undertaking may be registered and protected from infringement.
The Act creates a central trademark registry for this purpose.
It also lays down the procedure for the duration of registration, rights guaranteed after registration, assignment and transmission of such rights.
Another pertinent law under the Intellectual Property Rights that a company must be aware of is ‘The Copyright Act’ of 1957.
Under this Act, works having a degree of originality are entitled to get copyrighted.
Such works are original, literary, dramatic, artistic or musical works, sound recordings in films and the typographical arrangement of published editions.
Now the rights which are granted to the owners under the Act are: right to copy the work, rent or lend the work to the public, perform show or play the work in public, broadcast the work including electronic transmissions.
These rights under the Copyright Acts are granted to the owner for a specific duration which is mentioned under the Act itself.
In case the work is copied during that time period by someone without the permission, the owner can bring an action against the infringement under the Act.
Now the rapid economic and industrial growth in India in the last few decades has raised the issue on environmental protection as well.
This module is the Corporate Insolvency Legislative Framework in India.
This module is a part of corporate law module for the UGC MOOCS.
I am Dr. Risham Garg of National Law University Delhi.
I shall be discussing the essentials of the corporate insolvency legislative Framework in India.
In the absence of a unified common framework of corporate insolvency laws, corporate insolvency relies immensely on a series of debt recovery laws, administrative orders, judicial decisions, debt recovery laws include primarily for legislations.
Companies Act 2013 and Old Companies Act of 1956, the SICA 1985, the SARFAESI act of 2002 and the RDDBFI Act of 1993.
This myriad of legislations have been recognized unanimously as for the delaying the process of insolvency and bankruptcy in India.
Which is further effected by a variety of forum enjoying jurisdiction such as the High Court's the BIFR, the CLB, the DRT’s.
This has led to plummeting foreign investments in India and its abysmal standing in the World Bank's ease of doing business index 2015 on the ease of resolving insolvencies.
Now what are the legislations mainly dealing with the corporate insolvency and restructuring in India.
Under the SICA industrial companies whose net worth has eroded by hundred percent as are identified as being in distress and a reference to the BIFR.
There after the BIFR must investigate the potential viability of the industrial company and then either recommends its rehabilitation scheme or winding up before the High Court.
SARFAESI, the act provides mechanism to the secured creditor to take possession of the property of the data without intervention of the courts or tribunals.
Appeals against such position may be made to the DRT.
RDDBFI, this act focus is specially on the easing, recovery for banks and other financial institutions both secured and unsecured creditors.
The act additionally provided for the establishment of DRT’s and the DRAT’s.
As mentioned above a host of legislation and forum combined with potentially conflicting jurisdictional issues has resulted in systemic delays and complexities in the insolvency and bankruptcy process.
Additionally all these legislatives have been identified as being inadequate in by themselves and it would be pertinent to discuss a few issues relating to the same.
First let us start with the SICA and its problems.
The functioning of SICA has been at the receiving end of immense criticism with judicial pronouncements further complicating and worsening matters.
Delays further contribute to the further issues such as debtors used the delay to defer payments to the creditors because of the moratorium that is placed upon creditor enforcement.
Corporate assets have often been siphoned off during the long drawn process.
The managers coerce creditors into extending further finance or end-up extracting concessions as a result of the delays and the obstacles that lie in the path of debt recovery.
In the past high courts have received several frivolous applications of judicial review of BIFR decisions and they have often strayed beyond the limits of Judicial review and have engaged with the merits of the case.
Moreover the efficiency and overburdening of official liquidator are also responsible for causing delays.
SICA is capable of achieving a swift liquidation where creditors rejected possibility of revival.
For instance a company moving relatively swiftly through the BIFR was able to obtain a liquidation opinion being issued in under one year.
In proper identification of companies that can be restructured.
It has been repeatedly stated that the BIFR has failed satisfactorily identify the restructurable companies or sanction feasible schemes.
Which has severely hampered the creditors interest.
SICA does not assist to the creditor.
It has been observed that the High Courts have often sent cases back to the BIFR to conduct enquiry into rehabilitation.
The High Court have does not followed the text of the SICA which says that they shall give effect to winding up orders of BIFR.
The Kanoria Jute Industries Limited vs. The Appellate Authority.
In this case there were two writ petitions challenging the BIFR liquidation opinion.
The company had been registered under the act in 1987 and the opinion of BIFR was issued in 2002 and was affirmed by the appellate authority in 2005.
After one more rehabilitation attempt.
The Calcutta High Court permitted the remaining case back to the BIFR based on the ground that the new parties were interested in rehab.
This was done on the basis that it will greatly serve the cause of the workers and employees of the company.
The interest of the creditor was not given due importance and the opposition to such remission was rejected.
Then debtor is in control during companies revival.
The process followed in SICA as such that the debtor is in control of the company when attempts are being made to revive it.
This often goes against the interest of the creditors.
No winding up orders can be passed by BIFR.
If the BIFR opines that liquidation is required.
It has to forward such opinion to the state High Courts to given effect.
It has interim powers to order sale of assets and receiving court is bound to give effects to such opinion.
The act provides that the High Court shall on the basis of the opinion order winding up.
The most important judicial innovation that has been done is enabling companies to explore, rehab after the issuance of a liquidation opinion by the BIFR.
This relief is often given on an interim basis.
This option is given not on the basis of any finding of error on the part of BIFR rather it is given on an ad hoc based on merits.
Now let us take up the SARFAESI Act and the problems associated with the enforcement of the SARFAESI Act.
The Supreme Court by providing the DRT’s the right to set aside still affected by the creditor seems to have defeated the objective of the SARFAESI Act.
In some of its earlier decisions however in some recent decisions, in the recent decision in 2016 the matter has been settled and the priority of the SARFAESI Act has been established.
Previously it had the held that the DRT is on appeal can look into claims and counterclaims essentially opening doors to heightened intervention, which defeats the principle of non intervention.
Section 17 of SARFAESI Act 2002 provides for the right of appeal against the action initiated by the bank under the provisions of the SARFAESI Act of 2002.
The possession notice issued under section 13 subsection 4 of the SARFAESI Act can be challenged by the borrower or anyone aggrieved within a specified time limit.
On the other hand the judiciary has held that each measure initiated by the bank under the four mentioned section may be challenged by the borrower as a matter of right.
Thereby making the time limit mentioned above redundant.
Let us now take the some problems of the RDDBFI Act.
The whole purpose of the RDDBFI Act has remained unfulfilled despite creation of specialized revenues failing to help banks recover the dues on time due to significant delays.
The absence of any legal provision for facilitating, securitization of financial assets and that the banks did not possess the power to take possession of securities created in their favour adds to the problem.
There is an evident lack of clear and consistent interpretation of several issues by the chord which has led to greater confusion.
The problems while existent in the legislations themselves are compound when they are viewed with each other.
Conflict between SICA, SARFAESI Act and the RDDBFI Act.
Section 22 of SICA has led to a host of conflicts between the provisions of SICA and those of debt enforcement statutes.
This section imposes a moratorium of enforcement once a request is made to the BIFR.
This concern is reflected in the amendment to section 15 sub section 1 of SICA, which was made by passing the SARFAESI Act.
According to weight reference could not be made to the BIFR under SICA.
If a creditor had comments enforcement action under the SARFAESI.
In addition any reference that had already been made to BIFR would have to update if three fourth in value of the creditors decided to take enforcement action under SARFAESI Act.
Yet there has been a number of judgments where this conflict has a reason, for example a pertinent dispute arose as to whether the public interest in recovering debts due to banks and financial institutions is to give way to the public interest in rehab of sick units.
It was held that the debt recovery from a sick units take importance over returns to revive it.
Hence SARFAESI Act will gain precedence.
Hence despite of provisions of SICA, a secured creditor of a sick industry can seek records in the SARFAESI Act.
In contrast if at least 60% of the secured creditors don't agree to exercise the right to realize their security under the SARFAESI Act, then the provisions of SICA would prevails.
Finally SICA proceedings cannot be preceded with where secured creditors representing not less than 75% in value of the outstanding loan decides to enforce their security under the SARFAESI Act.
Conflicting jurisdiction, judgments and parallel proceedings.
In the case of Kritika Rubber Industries vs. Canara Bank, parallel proceedings in the DRT and the Karnataka High Court with a group of secured creditors approaching the DRT and another filing a winding up petition in the High Court resulted in completely opposite decisions.
The HC ordered winding up of debtor and appointed official liquidator.
The DRT whereas the DRT favoured the creditors and ordered attachment of property securing the debt which was subsequently sold in auction.
The official liquidator sought and order to set aside the sale by auction ordered by the DRT.
High court held that disposal of property were to be carried out in association with the official liquidator upon filing of winding up.
According to the DRT simultaneous proceedings under the SARFAESI and RDDBFI are allowed with request to SARFAESI Act not being prohibited during pendency of proceedings during RDDBFI Act and vice versa.
The Patna High Court had in contrast quite held the opposite that proceedings under the RDDBFI Act could not be initiated if the SARFAESI enforcement action had begun.
In reconsolidated steel and alloys the Delhi High Court was unable to issue a winding up order following the BIFR’s reference.
Thus the creditors to file a separate winding up petition.
While the BIFR’s order was made in 1998.
The HC issued a winding up order only in 2005 because of a winding up petition that was filed by a creditor in 2002.
Such delays cause depletion in the value of the debtors assets and dilute any recovery that creditors might otherwise have been able to obtain.
The multi layered insolvency law framework has given rise to conflicts and multiple proceedings.
These proceedings direct us to understand that we urge to have unified bankruptcy code which can be made applicable to each and every aspect of a company in distress and also for all stakeholders.
Now I would like to discuss a case note on the Pegasus Arc V Haryana Concast Ltd.
This is a recent Supreme Court judgment of 2016.
Overview of facts.
The matter in the landmark case of Pegasus Asset Reconstruction Private Limited vs Haryana Concast Limited arose out of the Companies Act 1956, the SARFAESI Act 2002 and the apparent conflict between them.
Specifically section 529A and section 529 of the Companies Act and section 13 of SARFAESI Act.
The judgment dealt with the 4 cases that were clubbed together after conflict in judgments were passed on the matter by the Punjab and Haryana High court and the Delhi High Court.
Section 529A of the Companies Act of 1956, section 529 of the companies act provides the dues owed to the workmen shall be deemed to be Pari passu with the charge imposed by secured creditors on the company in case the creditors choose to enforce the security through insolvency laws.
Additionally disparity between the claims of workmen and creditors must be affected by the official liquidator appointed for the winding up of the company who shall represent the workmen in winding up proceedings and thereby enforce their charge.
Section 529A then provides that in a scenario that the secured creditors attempt to realize that charge during winding up that is through sale by the official liquidator then the dues owed to the workmen shall be paid first and foremost and thereafter the secured creditor can claim their dues.
On the other hand section 13 of SARFAESI Act provides a secured creditor within alibi within ability to enforce his or her charge or security interest without the intervention of courts or tribunals by taking possession of the secured property or taking control of the management of the defaulting business.
What were the issues pleaded in this case.
As a consequence of the provisions of the companies act the company judge imposed certain restrictions on the enforcement of security interest by a secured creditor under the SARFAESI Act so as to ensure a compliance under section 529 and Section 529A of the companies act.
The Delhi High Court found these restrictions to be in conflict with the SARFAESI Act, while the Punjab and Haryana High Court had held that the company judge could in fact place such restrictions.
Now what were the two pertinent issues, that were raised in the case.
First, whether any power can be exercised by the company court, directly or through an official liquidator, in relation to the sale of a secured asset by a secured creditor in accordance with the provisions and rights stipulated to the creditor under the SARFAESI Act.
Second whether a later offer a bettering the previous sale price in an auction is valid.
The reasoning of the High Court's.
The two High Courts chose very different lines of reasoning and argumentation incoming to diametrically opposite conclusion with regards to the relationship between companies act and SARFAESI Act and the priority to be afforded to secured creditors vis a vis a workmen.
First the Delhi High Court.
The arguments advanced by Pegasus.
1. Pegasus argued that SARFAESI Act was a complete act in itself and has to be interpreted as a standalone code without any reliance taken from the companies act.
2. Non intervention by the courts and tribunals formed an essential part of the act which was clear from the non obstante clauses present before most section of the act.
3.The framework provided for the enforcement of secured assets and the non obstante clause provided for the SARFAESI Act not only reflect the fact that the act is a complete code in by itself but also that in situation of conflict with other law the act being the specialized legislation the field would then have an overriding effect with the other law.
4.Other statutes as provided for in section 37 of the act, such as the companies act only complement and supplement the provisions of the SARFAESI Act.
As these acts are only subsidiary to the SARFAESI Act, they may be relied upon only in so far as their consistent and not contradictory to the provisions of the SARFAESI Act.
Now what was the judgment of the Delhi High Court.
The judgment of the Delhi High Court gave great way to the afore said arguments presented by Pegasus and made two main conclusions as to its judgment.
1. First the court first held that the association of an official liquidator with the sale of secured assets of winding up business would result in defeating the purpose of the SARFAESI Act which envisaged minimal judicial intervention and sought to provide secured creditors with an efficacious remedy.
2. Secondly additionally and quite conclusively the court held that the SARFAESI Act is a complete code in itself.
This means that the rules and provisions given under the act would prevail over any other legislation, in the case the companies act in the case of conflict.
Now what was your decision by the Punjab and Haryana High Court.
The Punjab and Haryana High Court on the other hand took a different approach and allowed for fretters to be put in by the company judge on the sale of secured assets by secured creditors so as to ensure Pari passu treatment of workmen.
The court relied upon the case of Rajasthan state financial corporation variant was held that a financial corporation had the right to proceed against a debtor in accordance with the provisions of section 29 of the SFC Act only if so long is there was no order of finding pind finding the past against the debtor company.
Finally the Punjab and Haryana High Court referred to the Employees Provident Fund Commissioner vs. OL case.
This case dealt with the dues payable by an employer under section 11 of the EPF Act 1952 and the conflict with section 529A of the Companies Act.
It was held that section 529A has a priority over the case of the companies act.
The SARFAESI Act took care the interest of the workmen through its own provisions by means of association of official liquidator with the proceedings before the DRT under the RDB act.
Similar interpretation must be taken in contents of the SARFAESI Act as well as other reason being so that section 13 requires notice to the borrower at various stages.
So the Punjab and Haryana High Court thus going by the past direction taken by a few high courts and perhaps a welfare intent set it in favour of workmen held in situations of conflict.
The workman will be held Pari passu with the companies act.
Now what was the decision of the Supreme Court analysis.
The apex court started with the opinion of the Delhi High Court and granted priority to the SARFAESI Act in coming to the decision.
The court relied on several factors and thereby give the following issues.
The reasons provided by the Supreme Court were firstly that there existed no inconsistency between the companies act and the SARFAESI Act as Section 529A of the companies act was specifically mentioned in section 13 sub section 9 of the SARFAESI Act.
Secondly the intent behind the passing of the SARFAESI Act was minimal judicial intervention in ensuring that the secured creditor could enforce its security interest as provided for in section 13.
The act also ensures that in case of any grievance the liquidator will have the right of seeking redressal under section 17 or 18 of the SARFAESI Act.
The respondents had failed to show that there existed ambiguity in the SARFAESI Act, which required reliance upon the provisions of the Companies Act.
The court then went on to compare the three legislations taken into consideration by the Punjab and Haryana high court.
That is the SFC Act, the RDDBFI Act, then the SARFAESI Act.
Upon a comparison the court found that while the first two acts could be surpassed by the companies act.
The SARFAESI Act is the complete code in itself and the reasons provided were section 9 and 13 of the SARFAESI Act strongly indicate that for the enforcement of the security interest of the secured creditor was provided for exhaustively and with the detailed procedure within section 9 and 13 of SARFAESI Act and the same was to be effected with minimum intervention of the court or tribunal.
Moreover the proviso to section 13 sub section 9 provided for detailed instructions being mindful of the provisions of section 529 and 529A of the Companies Act in 1956.
The proceedings under RDDFI Act have been previously up held by the Judiciary to prevail over the laws as it was a law enacted later in time, while section 529 was amended by the insertion of section 529A in 1925 and workmen's dues preference over the dues.
However the RDDBFI Act was passed in 1993 and therefore acted as a priority legislation over companies act.
The SARFAESI Act rules framed under SARFAESI Act also required that notice be given to the borrower or his agent at different stages.
Thus the rules ensure that oral has the knowledge of the proceedings under the SARFAESI Act.
In case the borrower happens to be a company under winding up.
Now reconciling the SARFAESI and the companies act.
Several provisions within the SARFAESI Act itself insure protection of the interest of workmen and enable them to realize that use without any association of the official liquidator.
The act provides the liquidator to raise an appeal to the DRT in situation where the liquidator is not satisfied with the remedies provided to the workmen.
Additionally a further appeal under section 18 is also envisaged as a further safeguard.
Several protections are already present in the legislative scheme to ensure adequate safeguards to workmen and the same can be achieved without providing further powers to company code or the official liquidator to interfere in the sale of secured assets.
There is thus no need to borrow anything from the companies act till the stage the secured assets are sold by the secured creditors in accordance with the provisions in the SARFAESI Act and the rules.
Furthermore even in accordance with the provisions, the rights of the workmen are protected by sub section 9 of section 13 and its five provisions.
Thus the necessary provisions of the companies act has been incorporated in the SARFAESI Act to protect the interest of workmen and also achieve harmony between the two acts.
Therefore the company judge cannot interfere in proceeding by a secured creditor to realize its secured interest as per provisions of the SARFAESI Act.
Now I will discuss in brief regarding the institutions in the involved in insolvency process, namely the insolvency professional agencies and the insolvency professionals.
The insolvency professionals play a central role in the effective and efficient implementation of an insolvency law with certain powers of debtors and their assets and the duty to protect those assets and their value as well as the interest of creditors.
And employees and to ensure that the law is applied effectively and impartially.
Though the design of an insolvency law and the respective roles assigned to participants.
Insolvency laws adopt a variety of approaches for example to the relationship between the insolvency representative and the court in particular to the delineation of power between them.
As well as to the roles the creditors might play in overseeing certain decisions of the insolvency and wrap and another issues such as remuneration and even removal from office.
Insolvency professional agencies, the insolvency and bankruptcy code of 2016 provides for registration by board of insolvency professional agencies.
Hereafter refer to as insolvency agencies, having insolvency professionals registered with the board as its members.
An insolvency professional agency is defined in the court as any person registered with the board under section 201 of the code as an insolvency professional agency.
An insolvency agency may be a person which includes the following: An individual, a Hindu undivided family, a company, a trust, partnership, a limited liability partnership and any other entity established under the statute.
The person includes a person resident outside India, a person resident outside India means a person other than a person resident in India.
And a person resident in India has the same meaning as assigned to such term in clause 5 of section 2 of the Foreign Exchange Management Act of 1999.
Now can an individual be registered as an insolvency agency? It appears that a foreign entity can be registered as an insolvency agency.

Now I will discuss with the cross border insolvency arrangements with other countries as provided in section 234 of the insolvency and bankruptcy code of 2016.
The central government may enter into an agreement with the government of any country outside India for enforcing the provisions of the court.
The central government may by notification in the official gazette direct that the application of provisions of the court in relation to assets or property of corporate debtor or debtor, including a personal guarantor of a corporate debtor.
As the case may be situated at any place in a country outside India with which reciprocal arrangements have been made shall be subject to such conditions as may be specified.
There is also a provision for letter of request to a country which may be issued.
If in the courts of insolvency resolution process or liquidation or bankruptcy proceedings as the case may be the resolution, professional, liquidator or bankruptcy trustee as the case may be is of the opinion that assets of the corporate debtor or debtor including a personal guarantor of a corporate debtor are situated in a country outside India with which reciprocal arrangements have been made under section 234.
He may make an application to the NCLT or DRT as the case may be that evidence or action relating to such assets is required in connection with such process or proceeding.
On receipt of such an application the NCLT may issue a letter of request to a court or an authority of such country competent to deal with such request.
Now I have discussed in this module. 
We have covered the aspects of the various legislative provisions.
The legislative framework for the insolvency laws in India.
So corporate insolvency was not basically covered in the Companies Act of 1956.
The Companies Act of 1956 only had a provision for winding up of a company.
If a company is unable to pay its debts.
The insolvency procedure was mentioned in just section 529 that in the event of winding up what will be the priority of payments.
In the priority of payments there were a few conflicting decisions of the Supreme Court.
There was a few conflicting decisions of the High Courts and before the matter was put to rest by the Supreme Court the various tribunals exercise their jurisdiction and which led to conflicting results.
Now again coming up to the analysis of the judgment of the Supreme Court.
The SARFAESI, the proceedings under the IDDBFI Act had been previously up held by the Judiciary to prevail over other laws as it was a law enacted later in time.
While section 529 was amended by the insertion of section 529 A in 1985 and workmen's dues preference over dues.
However the RDDBFI Act was passed 1993 and therefore acted as a priority legislation about the companies act.
The SARFAESI Act took care of the interest of the workmen through its own provisions by means of an association of the official liquidator with the proceedings before the DRT under the RDDBFI Act.
Similar interpretation must be taken in context of the SARFAESI Act as well.
Another reason for doing so is that section 13 requires notice to the borrower at various stages which in the case of a company under winding up being a borrower would mean requirement of notice to the official liquidator.
Now when the honorable Supreme Court delivered this recent judgment in 2016.
It acted as a major relief by reconciling the SARFAESI Act in the companies acts.
And ultimate opinion was that, thus there is no need to borrow anything from the companies act till the stage the secured assets are sold by the secured creditors in accordance with the provisions of the SARFAESI Act and the rules.
Thus the necessary provision of the companies act has been incorporated in the SARFAESI Act to protect the interest of the workman and also achieve harmony between the two acts.
In case of the insolvency process, the insolvency process has been covered under the insolvency and bankruptcy code which has provided in detailed the corporate insolvency resolution process.
The corporate insolvency resolution process has been provided for in the separate module which has been dealt with under the insolvency and bankruptcy code module.
So for further details on the corporate insolvency resolution process the module on the insolvency and bankruptcy code of 2016 may be referred to.
with this we come to an end to the module of the corporate insolvency.
And for further details and for the information you may also go through the text and material that are self assessment questions which are appended at the end of the module.
And for the further information you are most welcome to consult the respective teachers through the UGC website.
Thank you.
Investigation of Companies, its Need and Procedure.
Good morning, I am Dr. Ritu Gupta faculty National Law University, Delhi.
This module focuses on the importance of investigation relating to the affairs of the companies and the applicable procedure.
The new companies are that is Companies Act, 2013 provides for inspection, inquiry and investigation of companies which is provided in chapter 14 from sections 206 to 229 and these sections to 206 to 209 empower the registrar to call for information Inspect the books and conduct enquires.
Such powers maybe exercise if any scrutinies of any document file by a company or any other information he feels that any other explanation or information is required.
Section 210 that is Section 210 provides that the central government any conduct investigation into the affairs of the company and section 211 to 216 provide for the establishment of SFIO that is serious fraud investigation officer and investigation by Inspector when appointed.
The procedure of such investigations have been stated under section 217 and the further section in this particular chapter they provide for related steps for investigation and penalty for furnishing false, statement, mutilation and destruction of documents by the erring companies, companies they are committed any type of fraud.
The objectives: The objectives of this module are to provide preliminary knowledge about the investigation of the companies to the students.
Further the objectives are to appraise the students of the need and importance of Investigation of the companies.
And to make students understand the procedure of Investigation as prescribed under the Companies Act.
In the last few decades there have been a radical shift in the perception towards the business generally and incorporated Enterprises specifically.
If we talk about a case in National Textile Workers Union the Supreme Court of India observed that the company is now no longer a mere profit making enterprise.
But it has assumed the role of a social institution to discharge its social responsibilities for accomplishing the socio-economic objectives of a welfare state as enshrined in part 4 after constitution of India that provides for the Directive Principles of State Policy.
Further to keep an effective control and check over the functioning of the companies the Companies Act, 2013 provides for administrative machinery as well as the procedure for inspection, inquiry and investigation of the companies.
The act imposes a duty upon the directors and officers of any company to produce books and papers and provides information demanded by the registrar.
Disobedience on the part of the directors makes them liable for imprisonment as well as fine.
The registrar or the Inspector may order for search and seizure of books and papers if they have some grounds to believe.
So, those grounds should be reasonable.
The central government is authorized to issue orders for such investigations.
The activate for establishment of SFIR as I told the overview to investigate these type of frauds.
Now, let us talk about what is need about investigation of companies.
Since, the shareholders themselves are unable to supervise and ensure efficient functioning of the companies, the organized supervisors by government agencies assumes significant role.
Its only efficient and smooth functioning of the corporate that can ensure an adequate return on capital invested by the shareholders and this need is was explained by the Supreme Court in Barium Chemicals Limited case.
In Barium Chemicals Limited the Supreme Court has observed the elementary philosophy of the Companies Act is to trust the shareholders for ensuring efficient performance.
But for reasons more than one the shareholder they have already receded to the background.
Firstly, he is an investor who, for the most part does not wish to be bothered except for dividends.
Secondary, due to great diffusion of stock shareholders become indifferent to voting and controlling.
And thirdly, the shareholders are ill equipped to challenge the wisdom and experts of officers.
Fourthly, for shareholders have the means or ability to act against the management.
If we here we can take a quote from fuend (1:29) he says the reality of control can only be found in the action of public opinion and in the organized supervision exercise by government agency.
Hence, this is the importance of Investigation that is why we are doing this module and that is why the companies unclear (1:48) have provided for these positions.
Thus, the provisions for investigation they help prevent corporate abuses, as well as wrongs and ensure efficient functioning of the corporate managements.
If we compare inspection and investigation.
First, I will talk about inspection: The registrar is empowered to carry out inspection of the books of accounts and other documents of the company.
Where on a scrutiny of any document filed by a company or on any information received by him.
The register is of the opinion that any further information or explanation or any further documents relating to the company is necessary, he may by a written order required the company to furnish and writing such information.
This has been provided subsection 1 of section 206.
For carrying out on inspection or inquiry, the registrar or inspector shall have powers of a civil court in relation to the matters as has been prescribed under subsection 3 for section 207.
The registrar or inspector shall submit a report to the Central Government and recommend, if necessary, further investigations is required into the affairs of the company.
Further the registrar or inspector may enter and search the place or place or places and seize such books and papers if he has reasonable ground to believe the such papers as mentioned are likely to be destroyed, mutilated, altered, falsified or somehow they have secretary depositavely somewhere.
No company or member can ask for a copy of Inspection Report.
The expenses of Inspection are war either by the government and these are not recoverable by the company section 225 provides by.
And if we compared inspection and investigation; so let us talk about the procedure of Investigation.
First: on receiving the report of the registrar or Inspector under section 208 or on intimation of a special resolution passed by a company or in Public Interest, the Central Government may order an investigation, where necessary, into the affairs of a company.
The central government may appoint one or more persons as inspectors to investigate into the affairs of the company.
And no firm, body corporate or association shall be appointed as inspector.
Further the Central Government shall establish an office we should be termed as I told you in the introduction SFIO that is Serious Fraud Investigation Office to investigate frauds relating to companies.
It is a multi-disciplinary organization consisting of experts from various fields.
If we name banking, Law, Corporate Affairs; they may be expert in taxation or information technologies and further the details are provided.
The director of SFIR may designate such number of Inspector as he may consider necessary to investigate into the affairs of the company.
Where any case has been assigned to SFIO, no further investigation order of agency of either Central or State Government can investigate the same case.
The officer designated shall have the powers of an inspector as has been provided under section 217.
SFIO shall conduct the investigation in the matter and follow the procedure as per the provisions.
And he is going to submit his report to the central government within the specified time period.
The Central Government may demand an interim report of the investigation.
The Director, Additional Director or Assistant Director of SFIO may a rest any person who he believes is guilty of an offence punishable under the section.
Such person arrested shall within 24 hours be taken to a Judicial Magistrate or a Metropolitan Magistrate who have got the jurisdiction.
A copy of investigation report may be obtained by any person concerned by making an application in this regard to the court Section 212 subsection 3 can be referred for this.
The expenses, in the first instant, shall be defrayed by the Central Government but may be reimbursed partially or fully by the person as prescribed under section 225.
Let us talk about the rights of bail of persons charged and arrested guilty persons.
Sections 212 subsection 6 to 10 provide for at the deal with the procedure aspect.
The offences specified under various provisions of the act that attract punishment for fraud under section 447 are to be cognizable offences.
The persons accused of any such offence shall not be released or on his own bond unless the public prosecutor have been given an opportunity to oppose the application for such release.
The court is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for believing that he is not guilty of such offence and that he is not likely to commit any offence.
However, the following may be release on bail if the special court so directs, if the situation is that the person is below 16 years of age.
It’s a women or somebody who is sick or somebody who is frail (8:13) or info.
The special court is not to take cognizance of any offence except upon a complaint in writing made by the director, or by the SFIR investigating officer or any other officer of the Central Government authorized by a general or special order in writing.
These limitations of section 212 subsection 6 are in addition to the limitation as have been provided under the Criminal Procedure Code, 1973.
Let us now discuss the powers of the Central Government: The central government may appoint persons having expertise in the field of investigations, cyber forensics, I have they may be persons from financial accounting, management accounting, cost accounting and any other field as may be necessary for efficient discharge of SFIO functions under the act.
Rule 3 of the Companies Act inspection, investigation and enquiry rules 2014 provides for it.
The Central Government where it deems appropriate, may assign the investigation into the affairs of any erring company as per the provisions of Section 212 to the SFIO.
Further if the central government so directs, the SFIO shall submit an interim report or investigation report on completion of the investigation to the central government.
On receipt of the investigation report, the Central Government may after examination of the report and after taking such legal advice as it may think fit direct SFIO to initiate prosecution against the company and its officer or employees, who or have been in employment of the company or any other person directly or indirectly connected with the affairs of the company.
Where the Central Government orders such investigation, it may required the applicant to give such security not exceeding rupees 25,000 for payment of costs and expenses of investigation as per the criteria which has been mentioned in the rule 5 of the companies inspection investigation rules as I just talks 2014 rules.
And now talk about investigation by the tribunal and section 213 of the new companies act provides for it and it says that the following other cases: the terminal may order investigation into companies affairs where an application has been made by a member not less than hundred members or members holding 110 of the total voting power in the case of a company having share capital not less than one-fifth of the person on the company's register of members.
In the case of a company if the companies without share capital and the said application should be supported by such evidence as may be necessary for the purpose of showing that the applicant has a good reason for seeking an order.
And if that application is made by any other person or otherwise the circumstances suggest that the business of the company is being conducted with intent to defraud its creditors, member or any other person or otherwise for fraudulent or unlawful purposes or in a manner oppressive to any of its members or that the company was formed for any fraudulent or unlawful purpose.
Persons concerned in the formation of the company or management of the affairs have been guilty of fraud, misfeasance and other misconduct towards the company or towards any of its members or the members of the company have not been given all the information about its affairs which they might reasonably expect including information relating to calculation of the commission payable to managing or other directors, or to the manager, of the company.
Reasonable opportunity of being heard must be provided to the concerned parties.
The Central Government shall appoint one or more persons or inspectors to investigate into the affairs of the company.
Such Inspectors shall submit their reports to the government.
The defaulting persons are liable to be punished for fraud and that have been provided under section 447.
Let us talk about investigation of ownership of the company.
Sometimes what happens in Public Interest, it becomes necessary for the central government to know that true person who are financially interested in the success or failure of a company and control its policy, or materially influence the policy? So, in view of these mentioned reason section 216 of the act provides that the Central Government shall appoint one or more inspectors to investigate and submit report on matters pertaining to the company and its membership.
Moreover, the Central Government is bound to appoint Inspectors if the tribunal, in the course of any proceeding before it, directs that the affairs of the company ought to be investigated as regards its membership and other purpose.
The Central Government may define the scope of the investigation, whether in respect to the matters or the period which it should extend and particularly may limit the investigation to matters connected with particular shares or debentures.
The powers of Inspector shall extends to the investigation of any circumstances suggesting the existence of any arrangement or understanding, which though not legally binding, may be observed in present or past or is likely to be observed in future or in practice and which is relevant for the purposes of investigation.
Now, we talk about the procedure and power of Inspectors.
Section 217 of the acts provides for it.
Which state that it is the duty of all officers, employees and agents, past and present, including those of any other corporate whose affair are under investigation section 219 states to preserve and produce to the Inspector all books and papers relating to the company and otherwise are reasonably able to give.
For investigation the Inspector has the power of civil court and a reasonable assistance shall be provided to him by the officer of the Central or State Government or police or any other statutory authority.
Notes of the examinations are to be taken in writing, read over to the person, signed by him and they become evidence against him.
Failure to furnish requisite information, or procurer books and papers, to appear before the inspector in person whenever required or to sign notes makes a defaulter punishable.
That punishable can be imprisonment for a term extending to 6 months and fine of not less than rupees 25,000 and extend up to rupees 1,00,000 and rupees 2,000 for everyday during which the default continues.
The central government may enter into agreement with the government of a foreign state for reciprocal arrangements to assist any inspection, inquiry or investigation.
Further, section 218 which protects employees from any action been taken against them during the course of investigation without approval of the tribunal.
Section 219 enables the inspectors to conduct investigation into the affairs of the related companies.
Further, section 220 empowers the inspector to conduct searches and seizures as if he had the right to do so under the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code, 1973.
The tribunal is empowered to order for freezing of the assets of the company during inquiry and investigation under the prescribed circumstances.
Further impose restriction upon securities if appears to be necessary which are needed for finding the real facts.
Section 223, provides that the inspector may submit his interim reports and final report on the conclusion of the investigation in the Central Government.
A copy of the report can be obtained by making an application to the Central Government and the report has to be authenticated by the seal of the company whose affairs have been investigated, or by a certificate of the public officer having custody of the reports as per section 76.
If we can recall evidence act, 1872 and this report is admissible in any legal proceeding as evidence to its contents.
This section shall not apply to the report of SFIO and section 212.
Now, we talk about the action which is to be taken in pursuance of the report section 224 of the act provides and its states if from the report, it appears that any person have been guilty of an offence for which he is criminally liable, the Central Government may prosecute him for the offence.
If the report shows that it would be expedient to wind up the company, the Central Government may file a petition for winding up on the following grounds can be stated that is just and equitable grounds or if an application for prevention of oppression and mismanagement under section 241 or both this factors are present.
If it appears to the Central Government from the report that the proceedings ought to be brought in public interest by the company or anybody corporate whose affairs have been investigated for recovery of damages in respect of fraud, misfeasance or other misconduct in the promotion, formation or management of the company or for recovery of any property of such company, then the central government may itself bring proceedings for winding up in the name of company, for which the company has to indemnify the government of its costs.
Now, we discuss the disgorgement of benefits obtained by the director, section 224 subsection 5 states where the report states that a fraud has taken place in a company and due to such fraud any director, key managerial personnel, other officer of the company or any other person or entity, has taken undue advantage or benefit in any form what so ever, the Central Government may file an application to the tribunal for appropriate order for disgorgement of such benefit.
And also for holding the person concerned liable personally without any limitation or liability.
Section 225 of the act provides for expenses of the investigation which are to be borne by the Central Government at the initial stage but the government can seek reimbursement from any person who has been convicted or prosecuted or called upon to pay damages or restore the property of the company.
The company in whose name the proceedings have been brought or persons dealt within the report or applicants for investigation where the inspector was appointed under section 213.
Further section 226 provide for voluntary winding up of the company which should not stop somehow investigation.
An investigation can be initiated and it is not to be stopped only because an application has been made under section 241 or the company has passed a special resolution for voluntary winding up or any other proceeding for the winding up of the company is pending before the tribunal.
The Inspector has to inform the tribunal of the pendency of the investigation.
The Tribunal may pass such order as it deems fit.
Legal Advisers and Bankers not to disclose the information certain information under section 227 that those legal advisor or bankers they should not disclose any privileged communication or information relating to the affairs to the customers of the bank.
And section 228 provides for investigation of foreign companies with effect from first April, 2014.
The provisions mentioned herein shall apply mutandis to inspection, inquiry or investigation in relation to the foreign companies.
Penalty for furnishing false statement, mutilation or destruction of documents is provided under section 229 which provides that any person who is required to provide an explanation during the course of inspection enquiry or investigation destroy, mutilates or falsifies or conceals or tempers or unauthorized removes documents related to property or affairs of the company or makes a false entry in any document concerning the company or body corporate or furnishes false information shall be punishable for fraud as provided under Section 447.
In this module,we have learnt about the need and importance of Investigation of companies.
We have understood the legal framework of Investigation pertaining to the affairs of the companies.
And we have tried to find out the prescribed procedure for the same under the New Companies Act ,2013.

Now I will introduce you to the contents of the module .
The new companies Act confers powers on the central government to constitute National Company Law Tribunal and National Company Law appellate Tribunal.
These tribunals are Quasi judicial bodies that govern the companies which are functioning in India and administer the provisions of the Act .
The present act has replaced the earlier body known as company law board club .
It would exercise almost similar powers that were being assigned to by the erstwhile company Law Board.
The constitution of one body that is NCLT has streamlined the administration of justice under the Act .
It is intended to have greater expertise to adjudicate disputes more efficiently and expeditiously .
The appeal from NCLT orders would lie before NCLAT .
The second appeal maybe file with Supreme Court.
The whole justice administration system has been made time bound .
The Tribunals comprise of senior judicial and Technical members and these Tribunals are not bound by the procedure as has been laid by the Civil Procedure Code 1908 and have the power to regulate their own procedures.
These are to be further guided by the principles of natural justice pngs .
Their orders are enforceable just like the degree of any Court .
Now, let us discuss the constitution of National Company Law Tribunal which has been provided under section 408 .
National Company Law Tribunal is a successor quasi judicial body of Company Law Board.
The central government is to constitute this Tribunal that will consists of a President and such number of judicial and Technical members as may be deemed necessary.

The central government shall notify such appointments.
The appellate Tribunal has to hear appeals against the orders of the Tribunal.
Further section 411 states the chairperson shall be a person who is or has been a Judge the supreme court or the chief justice of a High Court .
A judicial member has to be a person who is a sitting or retired judge of the high court or judicial member of the Tribunal for 5 years .
A technical member has to possess the same qualifications as stated in the constitution of the Tribunal.

The members of the Tribunal and Technical members of Appelate Tribunal have to be appointed on the recommendation of a selection committee .

Then we have the following members.

Further the secretary in the Ministry of Corporate Affairs shall be the convener of the selection committee.
The said Committee shall determine its procedure for recommending persons as we have just discussed .
However no such appointment of the members of the Tribunal or the appellate Tribunal shall be invalid due to any defect or vacancy in the constitution of the selection committee .

Section 413 to 414 provide for it.
The president in every other member of the terminal is to hold office for a term of 5 years from the date on which enters upon his office.
He shall be eligible for reappointment for another term of 5 years.
The age of retirement would be 67 years for the president while that of the members is 65 years .
The salary allowances and other terms and conditions of service of the members of the Tribunal and the appellate Tribunal would be prescribed under the rules .
However we have to see it that is provided further that neither the salary and allowances nor the other terms and conditions of service of the member shall be varied to the prejudice of those who have been appointed.
National Company Law Appellate Tribunal, salaries allowances and other terms and conditions of service of the chairperson and other members rules 2014.
And National Company Law Tribunal salary, allowances and other terms and conditions or service of the president and other members rules 2013 may be referred for the same along with the other rules.
Whatever rules have been drafted and when whenever these rules are framed by the concerned authorities.
Section 415 provides that, if any Casual Vacancy arises in the office of the President or chairperson or in his ability to Act .
The senior most member is to act until new appointment if the chairperson, the president or any other member wishes to resign .
He may do so by .

And tell the expiry of 3 months from the date of receipt of such notice by the central government or a person duly appointed as his successor and enters upon his office or his term of the office comes to an end or out of above mentioned whichever is earliest becomes applicable in that particular situation.
Now, let us discuss how these members can be removed .
Section 417 provides for the removal of the members .
The central government may order for the removal of any of the persons appointed under earlier sections ,which we have just discussed ,after consultation with Chief Justice of India in the following He has been adjudged as an insolvent or has been convicted for an offence which in the opinion of the central government involves moral turpitude or has become physically or mentally in-capable of acting.
In such cases the President , the Chairperson or the member or has a acquired such financial or other interest as is likely to affect prejudicially his functions.
As such president ,the chairperson of the member or has so abused his position as to render his continents in office prejudicial to the public interest .
Further, the provider to the section is also there , states that accept for the extra reason mentioned under clauses A.
The removal on any other ground would require reasonable opportunity of being heard.
A removal may be effected by the central government in case of proved miss-behaviour or if the situation is of any incapacity where enquiry has been made by a judge of the Supreme Court .
Such person must have been informed of the charges against him and he should be given a reasonable opportunity of being heard in accordance with the principles of natural justice .
Although he may be suspended during the period of enquiry .
Now it's the time to discuss orders of the Tribunal.
And how the appeal can be filed ?The provisions which are necessary here are sections 422, 423.
The Tribunal within 2 years from the date of the order may rectify mistakes in its orders.
No amendment however can be made to an order against which an appeal has been referred.
The copy of every order shall be sent to the concerned parties.
Further , the Appeal may be preferred before the appellate Tribunal against any order of the Tribunal by any agreed within a period of 45 days from the date.
We have to count from the date on which the copy of the order of the Tribunal is made available to the aggrieved person .
Section 421 subsection states 1 this and if any order is passed by the Tribunal with the consent of the parties.
No appeal shall lie against any such order to the appellate Tribunal .
The appeal to appellate Tribunal shall be in such form and accompanied by such fees as may be prescribed.
In case the Appellate Tribunal is satisfied that the appellant was sufficient cause from filing the appeal within the period of limitation of 45 days, the appellate Tribunal may condone the delay in filing of appeal but not exceeding 45 days.
After the expiry of period of limitation of 45 days and entertain the appeal after expiry of said period of 45 days.
On receipt of appeal the appellate Tribunal shall provide a reasonable opportunity of hearing to the parties to the appeal.
And after hearing the parties to the appeal shall pass such orders.
There why confirming modifying or setting aside the order which has been applied against as its thinks fit and send a copy of every order made by it to the Tribunal as well as to the parties to the appeal.
Further, we can see that section 422 provides that every application has to be dealt with and disposed off as expeditiously as far as possible.
It should be disposed of the time frame.
You can note that it is within 3 months where such disposal is not done.
Reasons for not doing so should be recorded in writing .
After taking into account such reasons, the president or the chairperson may allow a further period of 90 days for disposal .
Anybody who is aggrieved by any order of the appellate Tribunal may file an appeal to the supreme court within 60 days from the receipt of the order of the appellate Tribunal to him .
It should involve a question of law .
The period may further extended by another set of 60 days and it should specify sufficient cause.
Now is the time to discuss procedure which is being followed by the Tribunal and Appellate Tribunal.
Section 424 of the Companies Act 2013 provides for it.
The Tribunals shall not be bound by the procedure as has been laid down by the Civil Procedure Code 1908 but guided by the principles of natural justice .
These have a powers to regulate their own procedure for the purpose of discharging their functions .
Under the act, Tribunal shall have the same powers as are vested in a Civil Court while trying a suit with respect to the following.
I am just , I am narrating the instances summoning and enforcing the attendance of any person and examining him on it requiring the discovery and selection of documents.
Receiving evidence on affidavit subject to the provisions of sections 123 and 124 of the Evidence Act 1872 requisitioning any public record or document or a copy of such record or document from any office .
Issuing commissions for the examination of witnesses or documents dismissing representation for default or deciding it ex-parte, setting aside any order of dismissal of any representation for default or any order passed by it .
Any other matter as may be prescribed.
The orders of the Tribunals are enforceable in the same manner as a decree of the court.
In the case of a company, the order will be sent for enforcement to the court in whose local limits the office of the company is situated .
If the order is against an individual, the order is to be sent to the court in whose local limits the individual resides or carries on business or professionally works for gain.
These tribunals shall have the power to punish those who commit contempt of tribunals .
Further, the tribunals have limited power of delegation of their powers.
The president members and officers are deemed to be Public servants by virtue of the provisions which have been provided under section 427 .
And they are not to be punished for any action which has been taken in good faith section 428 provides for it.
Further, section 429 provides for the powers to seek assistance of chief Metropolitan magistrates while section 430 provide that due to the extent of powers vested in the Tribunal ,no Civil Court would have any jurisdiction.
This is again a very any relevant provision.
Any vacancy in the Tribunal shall not invalidate any acts of proceedings by virtue of section 431 .
Section432 confers the right to legal representation upon the parties regarding limitation .
Section 433 describes that the provision of the limitation act 1963 are as far as possible would apply to the proceedings or the appeals before the tribunals.
The proceedings before the said tribunals are deemed to be judicial proceedings within the meaning of Section 193 and section 228 of the Indian penal code and also for the purpose of section 198 of IPC .
These are to be demmed to be civil courts for the purpose of section 195 as well as chapter XXVI of The Criminal Procedure Code 1908 .
The tribunals have the power to punish those who commit content of the Tribunals.
This has been stated under section 425 .
Section 425 provides that the Tribunal and appellate Tribunal shall have the same jurisdiction power and authority in respect of contempt of themselves as the High Court has and may exercise for this purpose.
Thus the powers under the provisions of The Contempt of courts Act 1971 which shall have the effect subject to modifications which can be that the reference to a high court shall be construed as including a reference to the tribunals and the Appellate tribunals.
The reference to advocate general under Section 15 of the said Act shall be construed as a reference to such law offices as the central government may specify.
Now, let us talk about the delegation of powers .
The power which are vested with the tribunals .
The Tribunal or appellate Tribunal may by General or special order direct subject to certain conditions .
If that may be as specified in the order ,any of its officers or employees or any other person who has been authorised by it to enquire into the matters connected with any proceeding or as the case may be appeal before it and to report it in such manner as may be specified in the order.
Further section 427 and section 428 state that the president members and officers are deemed to be public servants within the meaning of Section 21 of Indian penal code as stated as we have seen under section 427.
And they should not be punished for any action taken in good faith.
This section stated in section 428 .
Section 429 provides for the power to seek assistance of chief Metropolitan magistrates.
It states that the tribunal may in any proceeding relating to a sick company or winding up of any other company in order to take into custody or under it’s control.
All property Bank of accounts or other documents request in writing today the CMM that is Chief metropolitan magistrate ,chief judicial magistrate or the district controller within whose jurisdiction any such property, books of accounts or other documents of such sick company are situated are found to take possession thereof.
Such officers may take possession of such property ,books of accounts or other documents and cost to be entrusted to the Tribunal or other person authorised by it.
Here we can see that the purpose of securing compliance with the provisions of all of the provisions as we have just discussed the CMM, CGM of the DC may take such steps and use such force as may in his opinion is necessary .
No Act of the CMM that is Chief metropolitan magistrate ,Chief Judicial Magistrate or the district controller done in pursuance of this section shall be called in question in any Court or before any authority on any ground whatsoever .
Section 430 provides that to the extent of powers vested in the tribunal, no Civil Court would have any jurisdiction .
Moreover any vacancy in the Tribunal shall not invalidate any acts or proceedings by virtue of section 431 .
Section 432 confers the right to legal representation upon the parties.
If we talk about limitation section 433 prescribs that the provisions of the limitation act 1963 are as far as possible would apply to the proceedings or if we talk about the appeals before the Tribunals.
Transfer of proceedings has been mentioned under section 434.
Now let us see what are the outcomes of the today's module.
In this module ,we have discussed many things about tribunals as have been provided under the Companies Act 2013 .
Specially we have learnt about these quasi-judicial authorities .
Then we had tried to understand how this tribunal is constituted, how the members are selected and how the members can be removed from their respective positions,.
We have also looked into the details of the their salary and the term of the service .
We have also tried to find the prescribed procedure as per the Companies Act 2013 and what can be the time for filing of appeal before appellate Tribunal and the supreme court.
We have also known at the end of this module how the orders are being passed by these tribunals and how this act is effective in expeditious disposal of the applications.
Thank you.
Hello I am Santhi, today we will be doing the Corporate law MOOC course.
Under this course, today we will be looking at corporate governance in Indian companies.
What are the objectives of this particular module? The first objective is to understand the concept and importance of corporate governance.
The second important objective is to understand what are the issues in corporate governance.
The third objective is to understand what are the provisions relating to corporate governance under the Companies Act 2013.
The other and the final objective is to understand what are the requirements of Clause 49 of the SEBI listing agreement.
First let us look at how did the corporate governance emerge.
During the begining of the twentieth century, we had a lot of illegal and unethical corporate business practices of the high profile business companies.
You we can take all of you might be knowing about the and Enron issue that had happened during the mid 20th century.
Now this resulted in the requirement of good governance practices.
So actually the and Enron and the various scams it shocked the business world.
What is happening? You need to have good business practices, you are playing with the money of the shareholders and for this you need to have good business practices.
And so this resulted in the requirement for having a very good governance principles.
And this laid to the thought process that fair and transparent mechanism has to be evolved to run and administer the corporation.
So, this fair and transparent mechanism that the businesses they tried to evolve.
They are based on four principles and this basis of which the fair and transparent mechanism emerged.
The first pillar was accountability, that is the company should be accountable for its action.
The company should adopt fairness in its dealings, the company should be transparent in its dealings.
The company should be having independent authority, the directors that is the CFO, there is executive, there should be an independence in the functioning of the company.
So, the four pillars of corporate governance are accountability, fairness, transparency and independence.
Now let us look at what is the definition of corporate governance.
So, corporate governance basically as you would understand is a fair and transparent mechanism to run the business.
According to the OECD the definition given by the Organization of Economic Council and Development corporate governance lays down the procedures and processes according to which the company is controlled.
Corporate governance is also set of relationships between a company's management, its boards, its shareholders and other stakeholders.
Now what are the issues under corporate governance? What all would come under corporate governance? How do you distinguish between the board and the management? What is the composition of the board of directors and related issues? What is the role separation, I mentioned earlier independence CEO and the Chairman of the company.
What are the remunerations of the directors? what should be the disclosures that should be done by the company? What should be the auditing process? how would you protect the shareholder rights and their expectations? What would be the role of the institutional shareholders? What would be the role of the investors? Now these are some of the issues under the corporate governance.
These are the issues that basically is taken care of in the corporate governance.
Now let us look at what is the importance of corporate governance, if a fair and transparent mechanism is followed how does it help the company.
It helps in the prosperity and progress of the company, it showcases the integrity of the company, it creates wealth through legal and ethical standards.
The benefits of corporate governance are that it will help the company in maintaining good relations with the various stakeholders, its various stakeholders.
It would provide protection to the interest of the shareholders.
It would help in , giving confidence to the investors.
It would help in increasing the value of the corporation.
It would ensure that the laws of the land are complied with.
You are more into compliance with the legal and the ethical standards.
Now let us very briefly look at how did the corporate governance emerged in India.
As you know, during the periods of 1991 we had lot of liberalization policies coming in.
Now it was the confederation of Indian industry in December 1995.
It set up a task force to draw a voluntary code of corporate governance.
This voluntary code of corporate governance was released in 1998 and this is called as the desirable corporate governance a code.
The name of the code was desirable corporate governance a code.
We had a Companies Act 1956 now, what was corporate governance or the what were the mechanism of corporate governance that was mentioned in the Companies Act 1956.
Let's have a look, the Companies Act 1956 is provided a formal structure of governance.
However it did not address the corporate governance problems adequately such as it need the prescribed any formal qualification, not duties for the directors of the company.
There were no difference in the management between the arrangement between the duties of a executive director and a non executive director.
And the focus on the financial reporting, it was rather on the rules, rather than on being transparent enough.
Then there was no chance of the auditors or the relation I mean the interaction between the auditors and the shareholder.
So, this resulted in and it could result in malpractices 'corporate malpractices'.
And then the company they did not have any provisions redressal of grievances.
So, this Companies Act 1956 had many lacunars as far as the functioning of the corporate governance was concerned.
Now the confederation of Indian Industries took an initiative under Mr. Rahul Bajaj and a task force was constituted and certain recommendations were prescribed by the Bajaj committee for the CII.
Now some of those recommendations were the board of directors were required to meet at least six times a year.
A person could not be a director of more than 10 companies.
A listed company of rupees hundred crores and above should had a professionally and competent recognize, independent non-executive director having clearly defined policies.
And the annual operating plans and budgets they had to be incorporated in the annual report.
The other recommendation was the stock exchange had to insist on a compliance certificate would should be signed by the CEO and CFO that all the accounting policies and procedures were followed.
After this, after the CII confederation Bajaj Committee report.
We had the next commitee that was constituted was by SEBI and SEBI constituted a committee under the chairmanship of Mr.Kumaramangalam Birla.
Now the Birla committee made certain recommendations.
the recommendations were applicable to all listed companies with paid up share capital of rupees three crores and above.
And the board of directors were to consist of an optimum combination of executive and non executive directors of which the number of independent directors had to be at least one third in case of a company, had to be a non executive chairman and at least one half in the company has to be have an executive chairman.
Further there has to be an independent and qualified audit committee to setup to enhance the credibility of the financial disclosures and promote transparency.
The other recommendation was the remuneration of non executive directors were to be decided by the board of directors.
The next recommendation was the board meeting was to be held at least four times a year with a with a maximum gap of not more than 2 months.
Then the management discussion and analysis were to be covered the report that need to be presented should covered the industry structure, the opportunities, the threats, the segment wise system etc.
Then a separate section on corporate governance covering the companies philosophy on code of governance, board of directors, audit committee, remuneration committee, shareholders committee etc was to be included in the annual report.
So, these had to be included in the annual report.
Now keeping this in mind, keeping these recommendations SEBI introduced clause 49 in its listing agreement on January twenty fifth in the year 2000 on January twenty fifth.
So, now as per this particular clause the information that was required to be placed before the board of directors on a periodic basis was budgets and annual operating plants, update on capital budgets, results for the company and its operating divisions or business segments of every quarter minutes of the audit committee meetings, the labour relations fatal or serious accident.
All these had to be incorporated in the report and that report had to be placed before the board of directors on a periodic basis as per clause 49 of SEBI’s listing agreement.
Subsequently, in 2002 the Ministry of Corporate Affairs appointed a committee under the chairmanship of Mr. Naresh Chandra.
The Naresh Chandra committee gave certain recommendations.
What were those recommendations? The first recommendation was that the board of directors needed to have at least half of its members as independent directors for the formal letters of appointment mentioning the fiduciary duties, terms of appointment, companies code of business ethics should be issued to the directors.
The next recommendation was the remuneration committee had to be constituted with majority being the independent directors.
Then the constitution of an audit committee compromising mainly of non executive directors with independent directors mainly constituting the majority.
The office of the chairman and chief executive officer, they were required to be separated.
And then the other recommendation was that the audit committee had to pre approve all related party transactions and stringent guidelines for the relationship between auditors and the clients were required to be maintained.
These were the recommendations under the Naresh Chandra Committee report.
Now in the year 2003 a committee was constituted under the chairmanship of Narayana Murthy, this initiative was taken by SEBI.
Now the Narayana Murthy committee give certain mandatory recommendations and certain non-mandatory recommendation.
Now, what were the mandatory recommendations? The audit committees of publically listed committees were required to review financial information records of related party transactions, risk management and legal compliances.
Further at least one member of the audit committee was required to have expertise in financial management.
So, an expert had to be nominated in the audit committee.
The next recommendation was the statements relating to related party transaction was required to be placed before the independent audit committee.
The next recommendation was the board of directors were required to lay down a code of conduct for all board members and the top management of the company.
The next recommendation was that the nominee directors should be appointed by the shareholders.
These were mandatory recommendations.
Now, what are the non mandatory recommendations? The first one, the board members were required to be trained in the business model of the company.
The second recommendation was that the board was to set up a remuneration committee to decideremuneration packages for the executive directors.
The next recommendation was that a performance evaluation of non executive directors had to be carried out by the board of directors.
So, the Narayana Murthy Committee gives certain mandatory recommendations and non mandatoryrecommendations.
Then in the year 2005 the Ministry of Corporate Affairs under the chairmanship of Dr. JJ Irani was required to submit a report on company Law.
Now in that particular report the recommendations were that in any particular listed company one third of the total number of directors or the board should compromise of independent directors.
The next recommendation was that, that the total number of directorship that could be held by a director was up to the maximum limit was 15 and then the corporate should allow be allowed to maintain pyramidal structures.
That is a company which is a subsidiary or holding company should be a holding company.
Then in the year 2009 SEBI came out with the corporate governance voluntary guidelines.
Now what are those voluntary guidelines?Some of the we can look at some of the provisions of the voluntary guidelines.
Under those voluntary guidelines a formal letter had to be issued to the independent and non executive directors.
There had to be a demarcation between the office of the chairman and the non executive officer.
A nomination committee had to be constituted of majority of the independent directors for searching and recommending and for appointing appropriate Independent and executive directors and the number of directorship should be limited to 7 members.
This was the corporate governance voluntary guidelines.
Now the companies if they wanted to they could ensure and follow these guidelines.
There were some companies which made these I mean they under took these voluntary guidelines.
However under the Companies Act 2013, the corporate governance got a new focus.
Now the provisions that were incorporated under the Companies Act 2013.
What were the those provisions? Let us look at those provisions that are incorporated under corporate governance.
So the Companies Act 2013, emphasized a lot on improving the corporate governance of the companies that is in improving the fair and transparent mechanism of managing the companies.
Now as relating to the independent directors.
The independent directors should be persons of integrity that is the Companies Act two 2013 laid down that the independent directors had to be persons of integrity and should possessrelevant experience of 5 years upto a period should possess relevant experience and had to be appointed for a period of 5 years.
And the code of conduct of the independent directors were also being prescribed in separate schedule to the act.
Now, the listed companies and other public companies with paid up share capital of rupees 1000 crore or more or turnover of rupees 300 crore or more as on the last date of the last latest audited financial statement was required to appoint women director.
So, a new concept emerged, the appointment of women directors.
The other points that was incorporated in the corporate governance under the Companies Act2013 was the key managerial person should also include a whole time director.
Provisions were also introduced for appointing a residential director who had stayed in India for a total period of not less than 182 days that is a person who stayed 182 days he could be appointed as a residential director.
And then a person could not hold directorships of more than 15 companies.
Further a director was disqualified if he was convicted with any offence which related to third party transactions.
Now the report of the board that is the board of directors this should also contain an additional disclosure.
So, the provisions of an additional disclosures were also incorporated.
Now what are those additional disclosures? CSR policy, implementation of risk management policy, the director's appointment and the remuneration policy and also policies relating to and also provisions relating to the related party transactions.
So, all those had to be additionally disclosed by the companies.
The next provision that was incorporated was that the company cannot enter into transactions or agreement with related parties unless approved by the shareholders.
And this is one of the very important changes that have been brought about by the Companies Act 2013 that is you cannot enter into transactions with related parties unless you get the approval of the shareholders.
The other most important provision that was incorporated under Companies Act 2013 was that regarding to insider trading.
The insider trading is prohibited and in case there are violations then punishment shall be imposed if the persons are involved in insider trading.
Another very very important provision that has been incorporated under Companies Act 2013 is provision for class actions suits.
Now, these class action suits they empowered the minority shareholders to seek action against mismanagement.
Now all these changes were incorporated in the Companies Act 2013.
The class action suits, the related party transactions, the insider trading, new provisions were introduced in Companies Act 2013.
Keeping in this the SEBI also modified its listing agreement.
Now as per the SEBI’s new listing agreement that is clause 49, the board of directors should compromise of both executive and non executive directors but non executive directors should not be less than 50% of the full strength of the board.
Then the compensation of fees paid to the non executive directors including independent directors shall be fixed by the board of directors with the previous approval of the shareholders in the general meeting.
The other requirement was the related party transactions that is the disclosure of all the transactions with related parties had to be undertaken by the companies.
Then the annual report should also contain a management discussion and analysis regarding the company's competitive position.
The shareholders had also to be given information regarding the appointment, reappointment or remuneration of the directors.
And also the companies had to provide a certificate stating that financialstatements had tobe reviewed by the chief executive officer and chief financial officer.
And every quarter a compliance report had to be filed and these compliance certificate and these compliance report had to be certified either by a auditor or the practicing company secretary.
And further the annual operating plans and budgets, they are also required to be filed in the companies.
So, now we have looked at the provisions of the corporate governance under Companies Act 2013.
Now, let us look at certain corporate governance practices in the Indian companies.
Now, for example in the case of ITC, the four principles of corporate governance which they believe in are trusteeship, empowerment, accountability and control and ethical corporate sustainability.
Then in the case of Maruti Suzuki, it considers itself to be a conscious and vigilant organizations.
The company has initiated good governance practices and it forms an integral part of the companies culture.
It has also constituted a control self assessment mechanism which evaluates the effectiveness of its internal control over the financial use.
Now Infosys, Infosys is another company which seeks to have good corporate governance practices.
The company has won many awards for undertaking the best corporate governance practices in India.
the company discloses to seek to attend the company disclosure they seek to attend the best practices of international governance standards.
Then you have HCL Technologies, the companies undertakes independent review of the corporate governance practices.
Now there are companies with good corporate governance practices but there are also corporate governance failures.
For example in the case of Sahara in the case of Sahara the Supreme Court has directed the SEBI to oversee the refund of investments that has been made by the investors through OFCDs in the two group companies, Sahara Indian Real Estate Corporation and Sahara Housing Investment corporations.
The Supreme Court has held at the SEBI could have special powers to investigate, adjudicate and protect the interest of the shareholders.
Now here the question of Sahara corporate governance was an issue and then you have the case of the real estate firm DLF which was barred by SEBI for 3 years on the grounds of non disclosure of financial details.
You have another case of financial technologies which came into light for executing a number of related party transactions without the approval or it was not in the best interest of the shareholders.
Then you had the leading pharmaceutical company Ranbaxy which is being accused of committing systemic fraud and then you had the case of Reebok in 2012 which to fraud of 8700 crore.
Now, the next concept which is very important is the concept of whistleblowing, which allows the reporting of malpractices or misconduct or corruption within the company which affect the third parties.
Now there are global legislations the Sarbanes Oxley Act or you have the the Public Interest Disclosure Act at the international level, in India also we have the Clause 49 which has a non binding requirement of establishing a whistleblowers policy for all listed company.
So, in case if there are genuine concerns you could approach the you could take the help of the mechanism and report the corrupt practices.
Then section 177 clause 9 of the Companies Act allows the listed companies makes the listed requires a listed companies to have a vigil mechanism in case of if there are they have to have a vigil mechanism which is to be operated by the audit committee or the board.
So for that a director shall be nominated who will undertake the role of the audit committee and the whistleblower could report any unethical behaviour or policies or frauds that are committing being committed in the company.
Now here section 177 clause 10 it provides for the safeguarding the victimization of the persons but the anonymity of the person that is still not been given by that particular provision that's a drawback of that particular provision.
Now this audit committee can take care it can take action in case of any frivolous complaints.
And then it is the independent director has been given a duty ascertain whether the vigil mechanism in functioning properly or not.
Now the vigil mechanism the details about the vigil mechanism should be displayed on the website.
And now if we see the corporate governance policies these corporate governance policies have actually provisions that have been incorporated in the Companies Act 2013 has laid to an improvement in the India's position in the world rankings.
India is now Ranked at 130 in the World bank’s doing business in the year 2016.
Now, the improvement in these rankings can be linked to better governance practices that are being followed by the Indian companies.
Now the further focus on the corporate governance standards it should not be merely as compliances but it should be a part of the companies culture.
Now, if it becomes a part of companies culture the effectiveness of the corporate governance would increase and this would lead it to better competition better Indian companies could which stand global competition and can sustain in the long run.
I am Shanti, assistant professor with school of business studies Sharda University.
Today, I’ll be taking up the Corporate law mook course and the topic under that Corporate law mooc course is Corporate Social Responsibility.
The objectives of the module are: the student should be able to understand the concept and importance of CSR.
The students should be able to understand the advantages and disadvantages of CSR, the CSR in company is and what are the requirements as per the Indian Companies Act, 2013? Now, let us first understand what is CSR? Now, we all know that Business and Society, they are inextricable part of this particular world.
You cannot separate business from the current day economic situations.
So, for these businesses to function in a particular manner without harming the resources or sustaining the resources in the long run, we need to understand that the business also become responsible in certain ways towards the society.
So, the corporate social responsibility concept: it refers to the way businesses are managed to bring about an overall positive impact on the cultures, communities, societies and environment.
Now, businesses influences all aspects of the society: so, the actions of these businesses, as I said earlier makes a tremendous impact on the society as a whole and as I said companies are a part of the society, so their very existence depends on the society itself and in fact the companies are a making use of the society to make profits for their business.
So, whenever there is business, the leaders of that those particular businesses, they keep the economic functions and the economic contributions in the minds that is their foremost thoughts in their minds.
Now, once the businesses has started functioning the society also started expecting that the company had to be not only transparent about its profits but also wanted the companies to account for the methods in they were earning the profits.
So, the society’s expectations where the company should tell us, how are they earning these profits that was what the society's expectations where and to meet these expectations of the society something needed to be done.
So, a new thought process emerged.
A new wave of thought emerged among the business leaders that if our society is expecting something we need to reciprocate to that particular thought.
Now in the cases of businesses we know making profits is the biggest motive and we call that as ‘capitalism’.
So, we say that the outcome of capitalism is only for profit but this process as I said earlier the business leaders wanted to have a re-think.
So, recently a new concept has emerged called as Corporational Capitalism or co-capitalism.
In this even though the focus is on the profit motive yet it incorporates the essence of cooperation, accountability and values in the social context.
So, this is reflected in the new generation corporate leaders.
So, the new generation corporate leaders now had a emerged with the new thought process that we should not only focus on the profit motive but we would also focus on the corporation, accountability and values in the social context.
So here, the profit optimisation garners more importance than profit maximization and because now there was more profit optimisation the accountability shifted from the from the shareholder to the stakeholders who all were involved in the running of the business.
So, there was also a growing realisation that the businesses in long-term will depend upon the optimal use of the ecosystem.
So, if we use our resources and we don't leave it for our future generations then the business cannot sustain in the long run.
So, this responsibility to act and influence the society in a positive manner, keeping in mind the future generations and taking into account the consideration of its potential negative impacts in the decision making process and doing business became a key factor and this thought process lead to the development of this key concept.
Now, this concept as I discussed of Corporate Social Responsibility was first laid down by H.R.Bowen in his book Social Responsibility of Business.
So, the attribute H.R.Bowen as the father of Corporate Social Responsibility, further even Milton Friedman discussed the concept of corporate social responsibility.
He felt that the business was usually for making profits but, this is not only this profit that the business make should not be made causing negative impacts of the society, no negative impact of the society should be there.
Now, the other person when we practically see the Corporate Social Responsibility Steven Hunts the CEO of the Employee Engagement Platform be inspired, said that the Corporate Social Responsibility in Walt, processes, practices that gave back something to the society.
Now, this particular concept of CSR has been a very emerging kind of a concept in the recent times.
Now, this aspect of CSR or we say that the business is that are there they are not only for the economic contributions to the society.
So, in the context of CSR we need to understand that there are three aspects which are the important base of the CSR.
The first aspect is the economic aspect, the environmental aspect and the social aspect.
That is, the corporate social responsibility will not only focus on the economic aspects but will also focus on the environmental and social aspects.
This approach where we take the economic aspects, the environmental aspects and social aspects into consideration is called as the triple bottom line approach of CSR.
Now, the most common definition anybody you ask anyone the most common definition that anybody would mention about CSR is: CSR is the responsibility of the corporation towards the society and the environment.
This is the common kind of a definition.
But this definition did not come about in a day.
This definition has evolved over a period of time.
The first thing, first definition in evolved was in the fifties and this approach which was taken in the 50s is called as the Social Responsibility Approach.
Now, according to the Social Responsibility Approach businessman when under an obligation makes decisions keeping in mind the objectives and values of the society that is the shareholder approach of the 1906 50s and in the 1960s we have the stakeholder approach.
Now, what is the stake holder approach? When a socially responsible enterprise takes into account the interest of the stakeholders and the interest of the whole nation rather than only striving for the returns to its shareholders.
That means you are not only the interest of the shareholders but the interest of the whole nation.
The interest of the all the stakeholders were taken into consideration.
This was the approach in 1960.
In the 1980s we had the ‘three P’ model.
Now, what does the ‘three P’ model say? This is an evolving system which envisions and integration that is a joining together, a coming together of the Principles, the Policies and the Social Issue Management and Process of Action.
So, you have the three Ps: Principles, Policies and Process of Action which indicated the definition of Corporate Social Responsibility.
Then, in the 2000s we had the three domain approach.
Now, as per the three domain approach: ethical, legal and economic domains were considered as the three domains of CSR.
And after that period of time we had the emergence of new concept in the 21st century we had the emergence of the new concepts.
Now, the European Commission defined CSR as and integration of social Human Rights please understand Human Rights came into the context of CSR; consumer and environmental concerns with business operations.
So, it is not only the Business Operation but you have the context of Human Rights, consumers, environmental concerns coming together in close association with the various stakeholders.
Then, the next definition of CSR was given by the World Bank which is very much prevalent.
Now, that is when business commit to contribute to Sustainable Economic Development, please note the new concept that has emerged Sustainable Economic Development by working with their employees and the families, local communities and societies to upgrade lives in ways that boards good for business and development.
So, the World Bank's definition emphasizes on upgrading the lives of communities and societies.
So, the communities and societies their wellbeing is given a lot of consideration in this concept of Corporate Social Responsibility.
Hence, the Corporate Social Responsibility is not a mere charity.
It's not, but it is an act which requires the corporate to go beyond its legal obligation.
It has certain legal obligations; it has to go beyond those legal obligations to integrate, to bring in together, the ethical, the social and environmental issues in the company's business processes.
So, we have to integrate the ethical, the legal and the social issues into the business processes.
Now, when there is integration, we say that a concept of Corporate Social Responsibility has emerged.
Now, when will look at CSR there are certain basic principles that form the basis of CSR.
What are the three basic principles? The first is the concept of sustainability.
Sustainability is: the company has to be taken into consideration whatever it is doing in the present has some effect for the future generations keeping that in mind.
So, whatever it is doing now it has to remember it has to keep in mind that the future generations are getting affected.
Accountability: the company is accountable for its actions towards the society .
So whatever it is doing it has to be accountable to the society.
The third principle: transparency: that is whatever the actions of the company are it should be transparent enough to the various stakeholders.
So, the three basic principles of CSR are sustainability, accountability and transparency.
Now, what are the advantages of CSR? It addresses the social issues that are caused by the businesses.
The second is it addresses issues being proactive, that is the company knows that there are certain issues that are going to be caused because that certain how much going to be caused by the society.
So, it proactively takes steps in order to see that harmful effects do not happen.
The next advantage that CSR has is – it creates short term employment opportunities, for example: if they are building up schools, they are building up sanitation for the sanitation they are building toilets.
So, you have people who are employed in those building development.
So, people are getting employment in those particular projects.
The advantage which the Corporate Social Responsibility will provide us, it increases the sales, the productivity, the loyalty of the customers.
You will get more customers when the customers know that your products or say, you are a company that is involved in responsible business practices.
The Corporate Social Responsibility is providing something back to the society.
So, that means you are taking into future generations into account.
So, that is a sustainability issues.
You are providing sustenance for the future.
The next advantages that it helps in the increased attraction and retention of employees.
So, when you have employees with a social bent of mind those employees would prefer the kind of company these which are more engaged in the corporate social responsibility practices.
The next advantage would be that the company would focus on the product safety issues because the wellbeing of the consumer, the wellbeing of the society is in the mind of the company.
So, the company keeps in mind the product safety and it kinds of decreases the abilities that it would incur on itself.
We had looked at the advantages but the CSR has also certain disadvantages.
Now, what are those disadvantages? It restricts the free market goal of profit maximization.
Businesses want to maximize the profit, but there is in this case there are certain restrictions that happens because you have to contribute a bit to the society, it might affect your profits.
The Other disadvantages, the social issues might not be really handle properly by the companies.
Social issues like maybe there are issues which are very very harmful which the companies might not considered in a proper manner.
The next disadvantage is: it dilutes the primary aim of the business the primary aim of the business is profit maximization.
Now, the primary aim gets diluted.
Till now, what we looked on, what’s we looked at, how the corporate social responsibility definition had evolved? What is the importance of Corporate Social Responsibility? What are the three basic principles of Corporate Responsibility? Now, in India the corporate social responsibility was always a voluntary part that was required to be done by the companies.
But, the companies were not actually doing it.
They were creating falls images that they were doing corporate social responsibility.
It was completely voluntary.
But, the government thought that it was time that we introduce the corporate social responsibility as something as a part of our law and this particular thought process was reflected windy introduction of the Companies Act, 2013.
So, if we look at the history of Companies Act, 2013 ,it was on 18 December, 2013 when the companies bill was approved in the Lok Sabha.
Then on the , on 18th December, 2012 the companies bill was approved 8th August, 2013 the companies bill was approved by the Rajya Sabha and on 30th August, 2013 the gazette notification of the Companies Act, 2013 came about.
Now, in this Companies Act, 2013 a new provision regarding corporate social responsibility was introduced, section 135.
Now, the rules relating to Section 135 was notified by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs on 27th February, 2014.
What does in 135 speak about? What is one 135? Let's look at it.
Section 135 states that a company which is having a net worth of rupees 500 Crore or more net worth of rupees 500 Crore or more or has a turnover of rupees 1000 or more or has a net profit of rupees 5 crore or more during any financial year will have to constitute a corporate social responsibility committee.
So, the companies which fall under any of these three categories will have to constitute a corporate social responsibility committee.
So, let's look at what this CSR committee is composed of? The CSR committee has to be composed of at least three directors and of the three directors at least one should be an Independent Director among them.
However, in the case of private companies this requirement of independent directors being appointed to the CSR committee is exempted from.
Now, this particular composition of the CSR committee is required to be disclosed in the board’s report.
Now, what are the functions of the CSR committee? The first function of the CSR committee is to formulate a policy for the company formulator CSR policy for the company indicating what are the activities that would be undertaken by the company? What are the activities that the company would undertake for the purposes of the CSR? Now, this activity is also listed in schedule 7 to the Companies Act, 2013 which we will be looking at a little later.
And the next function of this particular committee is to recommend the expenditure that would be incurred on the CSR activities.
The CSR activities that they had decided to undertake.
The next function would be to monitor these activities by a transparent monitoring mechanism from time to time.
Now, the CSR policy which they have to frame it has to be state broadly the projects or programs that a company would undertaker.
It should also list the CSR activities and their implementation schedule that that would be undertaken in the financial in a particular financial year it should also contain a declaration to the effect that the surplus that is arising out of the CSR would not be treated as the business profits of the company.
And it should also incorporate a statement to the effect that the corpus of the CSR funds would include 2 percent of the net profits of the preceding three financial years.
So, the requirement here is that the CSR the corpus of the CSR fund should include 2 percent of the net profits of the preceding three financial years and would include any income and surplus that would arise of the CSR activities of the company.
Now, the net profit that is calculated here, is the net profit before tax as per the accounts of the companies and this particular CSR policy has to be approved by the board of directors based on the recommendations of the CSR committee.
So, a company during a financial year should ensure that 2 percent of the average net profits that it made during the immediately preceding three financial years is spend on the CSR activities.
Now, what are the modes of carrying out CSR activities? it can be through an organisation or it could be through a trust or we could be through a Section 8 company or could be a collaboration between the company or it could be through other institutions but the requirement of the other institution is that that they should have a three years track record and the expenditure should that they incur for the other institution should not be more than 5 percent.
Now, what are the CSR activities that companys could undertake? As I mentioned earlier it has been mentioned in schedule 7 and these are not activities that are considered in the normal course of the business.
Now, let's look at what are the CSR activities that are mentioned in schedule 7? The first, eradication of hunger, poverty and malnutrition, providing sanitation and Healthcare facilities, promotion of education, promotion of gender equality and help in empowering women, training in youth for employment, enhancing vocational skills and to promote rural sports, contribute to the Prime Minister's National Relief Fund or other socio-economic development funds or other rural development projects.
The latest entry into the schedule 7 are the contributions to the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.
Now, these are the activities that are mentioned in schedule 7 but there are certain activities which cannot be treated as CSR activities.
That is, in CSR activity that is undertaken by the company outside India or any political contribution that is made by the company.
A 1 of events a company conducts a marathon, that is not considered as a CSR activity or you have certain kind of sponsored activities that is for the benefits of the family members even that is not considered as a Corporate Social Responsibility activity or if there are expensive that are incurred for the fulfillment of certain legal obligations that also cannot be considered as a CSR activity.
Now, what is considered as a CSR what is expenditure? CSR expenditure includes the contribution to the CSR corpus fund.
The contributions to the projects or programmes undertaken in relations to the CSR, the payments towards salaries incurred to the employees engaged in CSR, the payment to the volunteers, the but it does not include the expenditure for any other activity other than the what is scheduled in the schedule in schedule 7 of the Act.
Now, this particular CSR activities whatever the company has to be undertaken has to be reported in the annual report which is mentioned in section 134.
Now, the annual report should contain a report of the CSR activity which indicates the manner in which the amount spent, the projects that are being carried out the detail expenditure that is incurred on the implementation of the CSR projects.
The report should also specify what is the unspent amount? So, it’s not only the amount that is spent but what is the amount that is unspent? And the report should also state why the amount has been unspent? Now, the foreign companies there are required to annexe the CSR report along with the balance sheet that they are submitting.
The penalty for the disclosure is, there are fine on companies which amounts to not less than 50,000 and not more than 25 lakhs and the officer can also be penalised for rupees 50,000 to rupees 50 lakhs.
Now, the CSR policy has to be displayed on the website.
The names of the members of the CSR committee has to be mentioned.
Now, there are some CSR initiative that are being done by the Indian companies.
We have the Tata Steel with the Tejaswini Program – ‘the hospital on wheels’,.
We have the ITC; the e-choupal from ITC IOC Foundation taking care of the cultural heritage.
The Infosys Foundation taking care of the many of the CSR activities that are being carried out.
Now, these initiatives, they are contributing to the society however the economic cause that a company along with them Sometimes provide a deterrent to carry forward of these activities .
So on one hand the objectives of the corporations and the shareholders and of the society and the stakeholders there been trying to be balance in this particular Act.
However, the challenges of implementing this particular at will determine how objective this regulation of CSR will be met in future? So, if we look at the concept of CSR, the CSR has a potential to bring in a revolution to the development of economy because we are now mandating that the businesses has to be not only be getting profits making profits but it should equally contribute back to the society.
So, whenever a businesses has two function and has to earn profits it also should think about the future.
So, when business start thinking about the future the effectiveness of the corporate social responsibility practices would increase.
Thank you!
Good afternoon, everyone! This is Swati Bajaj
I am an advocate.
I have prepared a module on the topic Shareholders and Creditors Remedies of Personal Actions Derivatives Actions or Class Actions including cases of operation and mismanagement.
Firstly, I will give you an overview of this topic.
Like the shareholders and creditors are the most vital organs of an artificial body called company.
A company can grow only if its shareholders and creditors are happy and satisfied from the working of the company.
As soon the company involved with any misfeasance like oppression or mismanagement, its future starts seeing its nightfall.
So, in this module we will discuss the following topics in detail that is concept of oppression and mismanagement then the minority shareholders vs majority shareholders and then the remedies of shareholders.
This includes three main important remedies that are personal actions, derivative actions and class actions.
Now firstly, we will discuss about the concept of oppression and mismanagement.
Now, the meaning of the term oppression as explained by Lord Copper in Scottish case that is Elder vs. Elder and Watson Limited.
This is case of 1952
This was sighted with the approval of justice WANCHOO of the Supreme Court of India in the case of Shanti Prasad Jain vs. Kalinga Tubes Limited and this is the case of 1965.
The term oppression was explained in this case as the essence of matter seems to be that the conduct complaint of should at the lowest involve a visible departure from the standards of fair delay and a violation of the conditions of fair play on which every shareholder who interest his money to the company is entitle to rely.
This basically explains did you know what whenever a person in a public company whenever a person wants to invest their money in that company then they don't invest blindly they get to know about the company and its affair, its objects in details.
They go through the whole memorandum of association and the article of association and only after satisfying themselves that they are investing in a trusted organisation, they invest their money .
So, in such a case if a person is investing in the company because of this fact and then the suddenly those things get changed after they have invested the money.
So, the main primer unclear (3:01) objective on the basis of which they have invested their money in that company face.
So, in that case this oppression on the part of the company and in this case the shareholders become the victim of that in oppression.
After the term oppression the next term to be explained is the mismanagement.
To explain this term we need an illustration that is arsalan (3:31) case law that is Rajahmundry Electric Supply Corporation versus Nageswara Rao.
This is case of 1956.
It has been decided by the Supreme Court of India.
In this case a petition was brought against a company by certain shareholders on the ground of mismanagement by directors.
The court found that the vice chairman grossly mismanaged the affairs of the company and had drawn considerable amount for his personal purposes.
That large amounts were owing to the government for charges for supply of electricity, that machinery was in a state of disrepair, that the directorate had become greatly attenuated and a powerful local Janta was ruling the roost and that the shareholder outside the group of the chairman was parless to set matters’ right.
This was held to be a sufficient evidence of mismanagement by the Supreme Court of India.
Minority shareholder and Majority shareholder: The group of shareholders in a company is divided into two parts - Majority shareholders and Minority shareholders.
Majority and minority here doesn't mean that the majority like 522 or something like that.
This is not the majority or minority here.
Here, the majority and minority refers to that the majority shareholders are those shareholders who have the controlling power in their hands, controlling power of the company.
They are controlling the affairs of the company and the minority shareholder of the another hands are those who don't have the controlling power, they just have some shares of the company in their own hands.
They have their investment in the company but they are not controlling the affairs of the company.
So, in this case what happen that sometimes these minority share holders who are not in the company, who are not inside the company, they are the outside players of the company so their interest sometimes get neglected because every time they don't bother that what the what the majority shareholders are doing in the company or what’s not.
So, in that case sometime these majority shareholders by abusing their controlling power of the company misuse their power and then the minority shareholders have to suffer.
It is a very very important case on this point and it’s a case of 1843.
It is in this case where the basic principle was laid down by the court and that basic principle has certain exception because the principle is something which was in violation of the interest of the minority shareholders.
So, in that case the basic principle is this but then certain exceptions were given that in which cases this principle cannot be followed.
So, the basic rule which laid down in this case was that the courts will not enter when at the instance of shareholders in matters of internal administration and will not interfere with the management of a company by its directors so long as they are acting within the fast conferred on them under the articles of the company.
Now what we need to understand here is, you know what, then the companies are something which always involved in some competition.
One company is in competition with another company, another companies is in competition with another company and also with the first company.
There is Company Law board; they can settle their disputes by themselves.
There is no need to enter the court or to as a court to settle this disputes now but there are some circumstances where the court’s intervention is required and because this rule is something which is making the minority shareholders more and more week because they cannot challenge the actions of the majority shareholder in the courts because court is not at all allow to intervene in the matters of the company.
So, in such circumstances there are certain exceptions to this also.
Now, it has been stated by Justice Sinha of the Calcutta High Court in Kanika Mukherjee vs. Rameshwar Dayal Dube.
This is the case of 1966.
It was observed or stated by Justice Sinha that the principle imbedded in section 397 and 398 of the Indian companies act which provide for prevention of oppression and mismanagement is an exception to the rule in Foss vs.
Harbottle which lays down the sanctity of the majority rule.
So, we have discussed up till now 3 main points that is the concept of oppression and mismanagement, the concept of minority vs majority shareholders and the rule of Foss vs. Horbottle.
After discussing the 3 main 3 essential points what we came to the conclusion is that this oppression and mismanagement, these are the two atrocious activities we need to be prevented and because these 2 activities are those which are with the members get self indulge in these activities, so in such a case it become very difficult that as we have already told the court should not intervene in the small small disputes of the companies.
So, whether the acts of the majority shareholder of the oppression of mismanagement can be taken in the court by the minority shareholder.
This principle is not accepted by the court in the case of Foss vs. Harbottle.
So, in the case of Foss vs. Harbottle the court says that no, the court should not intervene.
But, in Indian case like; I have told you that the Justice Sinha in the case of Kanika Mukherjee this he did no this rule need some exceptions to it because if it doesn't give an exception to this rule then the interest of the minority shareholder will get violated.
And then the shareholders will know that the person will not become the shareholder in the company and they will not invest in the company and if they will not invest in the company then how the company can be administered.
So, the operation and mismanagement become the exception to this law; Foss vs. Harbottle.
Now, we will discuss the remedies which are available to the shareholders in case of this oppression and mismanagement.
Section 241 of the Companies Act, 2013 provides that any member of a company who complains regarding any oppression or mismanagement being occurred in a company may apply to the tribunal moreover even the Central Government, if of the opinion that the affairs of the company are being conducted in a manner prejudicial to the public interest then it may itself apply to the tribunal for an order.
In this module, we will discuss three different actions which the shareholders can take that is personal action, derivative actions and class action.
Personal action.
in this the shareholder claims their personal rights which arise from the constitution of the company was constitution of the company.
This constitution of the company is memorandum of association and articles of association.
So, the rights with each and every shareholders have which they which right they get from the memorandum of association and articles of association these are the personal rights of the shareholder and the shareholders can claim their those rights without any help from the other any other share holder.
So, these are the personal right and for these personal actions can be taken by the shareholders but however in Indian Companies Law personal actions of the shareholders aggrieved from the acts of oppression or mismanagement do not possess any statutory provision.
Now, we come to another action that is derivative action.
It is a very important.
An interesting area of law is the law governing derivative action which enables the company shareholders of the companies that is means group of shareholders.
To bring in action on behalf of the Company against a third party before a regular Civil Court again there is no specific statutory provision for the derivative action claim in the Indian companies law.
However, the doctrine of derivative action is recognised by the Indian courts.
if a shareholder alleges that are wrong has been done to the company by persons in control thereof he may bring a derivative action where he derives the authority from his corporate right to sue on behalf of the company.
The premise on which the court entertained is extra ordinary form of action is upon the complaining shareholder assertion that the company cannot sue as a persons in control would not bring an action or its behalf for its benefit.
Now, derivative action is basically defined as an action by one or more shareholders of a company where the cause of action is vested in the company and relief is accordingly sort on its behalf.
Since the company has the distinct legal personality with its own rights and liabilities which are different from those personal rights of individual share holders.
This action is brought by shareholder not to enforce his or her own personal right.
I’ll repeat that since the company has a distinct legal personality with its own rights and liabilities which are different from those personal rights of individual shareholders this action is brought by shareholder not to enforce his or her own personal rights but the right and liabilities of the company on its behalf and for the benefit of the company which the company cannot itself do as it is controlled by wrong doers.
In order to be classified as a derivative action the following aspects must be satisfied.
Firstly, it must be brought in a representative form that is though it is a company rather than the other shareholders whom the people initiating the league action / proceedings seek to represent.
By implication of all other shareholders are bound by the result of the action that is a group of shareholders came came together and they file a represented the suit in a representative form.
Here, whatever with a result of that action all the shareholders will get affected by that.
Now, although the action is brought on behalf of the company, the company appears as a defendant so that the action takes the form of a representative action by the initiating shareholders on behalf of himself and all other shareholders [other than the alleged 'wrong -doers'] I mean those shareholders doesn’t include the wrongdoers also and this action is against the alleged wrong doers and the company.
So, shareholders are taking action in a representative form against the company as well as against the wrongdoers and these wrong- doers are the part of the company itself they are also the shareholders of the company.
Now, the derivative action may be brought by shareholder or shareholders in the following instances.
First is ultra vires.
A shareholder may bring an action against the company and its directors in respect of matters which are ultra vires the memorandum of association or the articles of association of the company and which no majority shareholders can sanctioned.
For example directors of the companies sanctioning an action that is contrary to the objects of the company.
So, objects as I must told you that the objects of the company are the basic things on the basis of which the company is trending its building or its business.
If the company fails to satisfy those object that the main purpose for the establishment of that company get failed and then the existence of the company is not at all allowed not even by the court or by the other person associated with a company like its creditors.
Next is the Fraud on Minority.
Directors and the company would also be liable if the conduct of the majority of the shareholders constitutes a 'fraud on minority' that is, a discriminatory action.
For example, where the shareholders have passed a special resolution with an effect of discriminating between the majority shareholders and minority shareholders, so as to give the former an advantage of which the latter were deprived.
I repeat the example again where the shareholders have passed.
These shareholders are the majority shareholders that is shareholders who are in control of the business, where the shareholders have passed a special resolution with an effect of discriminating between the majority shareholder and minority shareholders so as to give the former an advantage of which the later word deprived.
Former is the majority shareholder and the later is the minority shareholder.
So in such cases, this is a fraud it is a fraud on the part of the majority shareholders on the minority shareholders and in such case also the group of minority shareholders in a representative form can take representative at derivative action in the court.
Another is required resolution that is certain actions of the company can be approved only by passing a special resolution at a general meeting of shareholders.
So, if the majority seek to circumvent this legal requirement and pass only an ordinary resolution, or do not pass such a special resolution in the manner required by law, then any member or members can bring an action to restrain the majority.
The majority shareholders and minority shareholders; they both are the part of the company.
The interest of both, the majority as well as the minority shareholder needs to be protected.
So, there is no need for the majority shareholders to take action by themselves and do not involve the minority shareholders with them.
It is their duty that whenever they take any crucial actions which need any special especial resolution and which needs the accent of the minority shareholder they have to get that accent they cannot exclude the minority shareholder that cannot neglect the interest of the minority shareholders.
The another one is to safeguard interest of the company.
For example, an obvious wrong may have been done to the company by the directors but because of the control of such directors on the majority shareholders, such shareholders may not permit an action to be brought against the wrongdoer directors.
Therefore to safeguard the interest of the company any member or members may bring a derivative action.
So, as both the majority shareholders and minority shareholders are liable or as well as responsible for the company.
They are responsible on behalf of the company.
They have to maintain the goodwill of the company.
So, if the minority shareholders of came to the opinion that the acts of the majority shareholders are not in favor of the company or that they are doing any act which is privilege to the interest of the company then in such case minority shareholders can take an action against the majority shareholders for the interest of the company.
Next is the Individual Membership Rights.
As a general rule personal rights for say are not to be enforced through derivative actions.
However, some exceptions have been recognised.
These exception often arise in case of rights that have been conferred upon the shareholders by the company act itself or the respective articles which is known as individual membership rights.
For example, the right to vote, the right to have one's vote recorded or the right to be nominated as a candidate for the post of a director during the election of directors at a General Meeting of the shareholders.
Prevention of oppression and mismanagement a representative action may be brought for prevention of oppression and mismanagement which are cases where the majority acts in a manner that oppress the minority where the majority acts in a manner which oppress the minority or where the affairs of the company are being conducted in a manner pre judicial to the public interest or oppressive to any member or members or in a manner pre judicial to the interest of the company including an adverse material change in the management or control of the company.
Since these proceedings are initiated for the benefit of the company, it can be considered a form of derivative action and find specific place in the scheme of the Indian Company Law under the Companies Act.
In order to obtain relief the company law board can be approached by not less than 100 shareholders or not less than one tenth of the total number of members or members holding not less than one tenth of the issued share capital of the company provided all the dues of the shareholders having by the applicants.
Winding up of the companies, its needs, grounds and effects: As we all are aware of this fact that now we have a new company’s law that is the Companies Act, 2013 and it has replaced and old age companies law of 1956.
In the new Companies Act several new section of provisions were inserted and several old provisions were deleted.
We have total of 470 sections in the new Companies Act, 2013.
Side by topic is winding up of the companies.
So, company is an artificial body.
Artificial as well as an independent body .
So, the question of winding up is very serious where up the persons for coming together to make their companies, to establish their company why they want to wind up their company.
So, winding up is a process whereby the existing companies affairs are brought to an end.
It is a very complex situation where the companies which came into existence in a inspire to grow higher with the passage of each day, in fact each second.
The turn of their entire business and this winding up can be voluntarily as well as can be compulsory.
Voluntary winding up can be understood at the if the members of the companies want to end of their business.
This is genuine, this is natural but where the compulsive binding up came into question than the question is the why, what are the ground, what are the factors with lead up the company to wind up their business.
So, basically, it is a process by which the properties of the company and administer for the benefit of its members and creditors.
You know, companies formed not only but the members there are few person like crediters who invest their own money in the company.
And if they invest their money then obviously they want some good return after that.
further of their investment.
So, whenever a company fails to give them the good return or whenever the company failed to satisfy their creditors than that lead the very complex situation of the companies where they made face the winding up on establishment.
In winding up is also known as the liquidation because here the person appointed for administering the assets and liabilities is called liquidator.
If there is a compulsory winding up the liquidator is appointed by the tribunal that is a company law tribunal under section 275 of the Companies Act, 2013 .
This is new company law.
So, on liquidation the companies name is deleted from the list of the companies by the registrar of companies and the same is published in the official gazette.
I have already told you that there are there two types of winding up: compulsory winding up and voluntary winding up.
Compulsory winding up is also known as winding up by tribunal because there it involves the there is a involvement of tribunal.
Section 270 of the Companies Act, 2013 provide these two modes of winding up.
Now, I will tell you the basic difference between these two modes of winding up compulsory as well as voluntary.
In case of compulsory winding up petition is filed before the Tribunal either by the company or the any creditor or by the contributory or by Registrar or any person authorised by the Central Government on the their behalf.
This is Section 272 of the Companies Act, 2013 which provides the persons who can file petition in the tribunal for the winding up of the company.
Whereas in the case of voluntary winding up section 304 of the Act provides that no petition is required no petition is filed before the court or the Tribunal.
In this case what happens the company passes a special resolution in its meeting or it passes a General Resolution in case of expiry of the period of its duration.
Suppose if a company form for a specific purpose and to compare in the article of as we all note that article of association and memorandum association two important document for the formation of a company.
If they have mentioned that they are establishing their company for a specific purpose and after the completion of that specific purpose they will end up or they will demolish their company then it is a very general or genuine reason that when they complete the specific purpose they will wind up or they will demolish the company.
So, this is the voluntary winding up given in section 304 of the Companies Act, 2013.
Now, in case of compulsory winding up the Tribunal at the passing at the time of passing the order of winding up appoint an official liquidator please note that here is a official liquidator or the liquidator from the panel maintained by the central government.
This is given in section 275 of the Companies Act, 2013 whereas in the case of voluntary winding up the liquidator the companies owned liquidator from the panel prepared by the Central Government.
Here, the panelist of the Central Government but who appoints the liquidator it is the company.
This is given in section 310 of the Companies Act, 2013.
Third difference is in case of compulsory winding up the official liquidator can be removed by the tribunal on the grounds which are mentioned in section 276 of the Act, whereas in the case of voluntary winding up the company liquidator can be removed by the company itself if it is appointed by the company or by the creditor if it is appointed by the creditor on the grounds mentioned in section 311.
Now, as we all know that a company company is established and a company is administered by two main vital organs: one is a member of the company.
They are the directors or the shareholder and another one is the creditors who invest their funds in the company.
So, if the company itself want to wind-up their business then in that case company itself can appoint the liquidator and if the creditors want to wind-up this value business then in that case creditors have the right to remove any company liquidator if they want.
Another main difference is that in case of compulsory winding up the order of winding up of the company shall operate in favour of all the creditors and all contributories of the company as if it had been made out on the joint petition of creditors and contributories, this is given in section 278 of the Companies Act.
While in case the voluntary winding up section 309 says that the company shall from the commencement of the winding up cease to carry on it business, except as far as required for the beneficial winding up of its business.
So, this is the main difference between the compulsory winding and the voluntary winding up as well as two modes of winding up.
it means that the winding up the company can either be compulsory or can either voluntary.
Now, further even the voluntary winding up is of two types.
Again I will repeat the same that a company is administered by two main vital organs one are the members of the company the shareholders and the director and another is a creditors and I have told you that voluntary winding up can be in forced by either the members or the creditors.
So, the voluntary winding up is also having two types: members voluntary winding up and creditors voluntary winding up.
In case of the members voluntary winding up declaration of solvency is made by the directors.
While in case of creditors voluntary winding up there is no need of such declaration.
In case of the members voluntary winding up only meeting of member is called.
While in case of creditors voluntary winding up meeting is of both the member as well as the creditor is called.
In case of members voluntary winding up the liquidator is appointed and remuneration is fixed by the company itself.
While in case of creditors voluntary winding up the liquidator in fact, it appointed by the creditors and remuneration is fixed by the committee of inspection.
In case of members voluntary winding up no committee of infection is appointed and I have already told that in creditors voluntary winding up committee of inspection is appointed.
In case of members voluntary winding up the liquidator can exercise some powers with the sanction of a special resolution of the company, while in case of creditors voluntary winding up the liquidator exercise powers with the sanction of the tribunal.
In case of members voluntary winding up meeting of members is called on completion of procedures of proceedings of winding up in another case that in the case of creditors meeting of members and creditors is called when the proceedings for the winding up has been completed.
So, these are the main difference between the members voluntary winding up and the creditors voluntary winding up.
So, till now we have discussed the concept of winding up, what is the winding up, the two modes of winding up that’s the voluntary winding up and the compulsory winding up and the two further modes of voluntary winding up ,that is members voluntary winding up and the creditors voluntary winding up?
A company came into existence with an aspire of growing higher and higher with an aspire or aim of earning huge and huge profit.
So what are those situation obviously there must be some serious situations serious reason on grounds which force the company to wind up its business.
In voluntary winding up there are no such grounds it shows the willingness of the company to wind up their business but in case of compulsory when the word compulsory rather than it shows that there is some force behind the winding up of the company.
There is not any willingness of the company.
So we will now discuss the grounds of winding up of the compulsory winding up of the company where there is involvement of The Tribunal.
Section 271 of the Companies Act 2013 provide various grounds on the basis of which a petition of can be filed in the Tribunal for the winding up of the company.
The first and the most important ground is that inability to pay debts.
Inability to pay debts itself clearly, clarify its meaning that whenever a company fails to pay its debts.
A company is always having some debts due, because a company is something which runs on the investments made by other persons and their duties and responsibilities of the company to satisfy those investments but if the company fail then what? Obviously if the company fails to pay their debts from the pocket of the company then the consequences have to be suffer by the company itself not by the members.
Members will do only one thing they allow the winding up of the company, they will never pay their debts of the company from the own pocket ,because company is one thing and its member is another thing .
They both are separate bodies.
So in case of inability to pay debts the compulsory have to suffer the consequences and the consequences the petition for the winding up of the company.
Section 271 of and subsection 2 provides it the inability to pay debts primarily arise under three circumstances.
It means when the creditor has made an demand for to the company that their company should pay their debts and from that demand three weeks preceding from the date of demand three weeks have passed then in that, after the completion of those three weeks the creditor can immediately file a petition in the court or Tribunal further winding up of the company.
Second is where execution or other process issued on a decree or order of any court in favour of the company is returned unsatisfied in whole or part.
So if if there is any dispute against the company in the court and a court has passed the decree against the company and company fails to satisfy the decree, then in such a case court can sue motto taken action sue motto plus on any application made by the decree holder.
So the court can proceed for the winding up of the company.
Thirdly, where it is proved to the satisfaction of the court that the company is unable to pay its debts now these three other main circumstances but there is a difference between these three, that in the first two the firstly when the company fails to pay on the demand of the creditor and secondly with the executional unsatisfy in those such cases it doesn't mean the company is lack of funds or the company is unable to pay.
It doesn’t show the unability of the company or the inability of the company is just show that the companies not paying whatever be the reason which is they don't want to pay or there are some personal reason or there can be some bonafide grounds on the base of it they are refusing to pay the amount.
but in the third case it is clearly mentioned that the company is unable to pay its debt.
A petition for winding up on the ground of inability to pay debts must contain all the relevant information about the debt.
The petition must disclose the assets of the company and whether they are sufficient to meet the liabilities including contingent and prospective liabilities.
Further the petition must also disclose the position of fixed assets as well as a valuation of plant and machinery of the company.
Now where a debt is a bonafied disputed by the company and the court is satisfied with a company’s defense a winding up order will not be made.
So even if the creditors or the tribunal itself sue motto had taken an action against the company for the winding of the company it doesn't mean that the company will came to an end.
There can be some bonafide reason on the behalf the company that why they are doing so or why they are not doing so.
So, in case of K Appa Rao vs Sarkar Chemicals Private Limited, the Andhra Pradesh High Court held that where a company has a prime facie sustainable defense or a bonafide dispute of its obligations to discharge the alleged debts of liabilities where the court may not entertain proceeding for the winding up of the company.
And once there is an admission on part of the respondent company of liability of dues payable then a petition under section 273 cannot be dismissed on technical grounds.
Company courts can exercise their discretionary powers of dismissing the petition even before issuing a show cause notice regarding admission.
Further, despite of repeated demands if a company neglects to pay its debts, here the word is company neglects to pay it will be considered as an inability of the company to pay its debts and an order of winding up can be passed by the court.
By non-payment of the undisputed debt within the period of statutory demand the company is deemed unable to pay its debts and where the companies unable to pay its debts, winding up ought generally to follow in public interest.
another ground of winding up a special resolution that is special resolution passed by the company’s member in a board meeting.
A company may by special resolution resolve that it be wound up by the Tribunal The resolution may be passed for any cause whatsoever.
However the Tribunal must see that the winding up is not opposed to public interest or the interest of the company as a whole.
There is a case on this point a New Kerala Chits and Traders Private Limited vs Official Liquidator.
This is the case of 1981 in which it is observed by the Tribunal that a tribunal has a discretion in the matter and under no obligation to order winding up merely because the company has so resolved.
Even or the constitution of India protects the national interest as well as they give the duties to the citizen of the country or the non-citizen also that they must do something in favour of the national interest but not against anything done against the national Law will be condemned.
Here also if the company work against the national interest then is such a case it can be wind up by the Tribunal.
So, if we said that if the company has acted against the interest of sovereignty and integrity of India, the security of the state friendly relations with foreign states, public order, decency or morality.
Then in such a case the company can be wind up by filing a petition in the Tribunal.
Next is the failure of scheme, failure of scheme what is scheme here? Scheme here means that if the scheme of revival and rehabilitation is not approved by the creditors, than the company administrator shall submit a report to the Tribunal within 15 days and the Tribunal shall order for the winding up of the sick company.
The Tribunal, on passing the order of winding up shall conduct the proceedings for winding up in accordance with the provisions of chapter 20 ,that is section 271 sub section 1 clause d.
Another important ground is fraudulent and unlawful affairs.
The term itself explain its meaning that whenever a company conduct any fraudulent and unlawful affairs then in such a case the company the Tribunal never allow the company to continue its business.
If on n application made by the Registrar or any other person authorized by the Central Government by notification and the tribunal is of the opinion that the affairs of the company have been conducted in a fraudulent manner or the company was formed for fraudulent and unlawful purposes or the persons concerned in the formation of management of its affairs having guilty of fraud, misfeasance or misconduct, in connection therewith and that it is proper that the company be wound-up; then such a situation the Tribunal May, on a petition filed by any authorized person can be contributory, can be the Central Government itself or it can be the registrar.
The Tribunal may pass an order for the winding up of the company.
This ground is mentioned in clause E of section 271 sub section 1 of the Companies Act 2013.
Another major ground is default in filing financial statement as we all know that the company has to file a their financial statement with the registrar of the company.
Registrar of the company is a very very important person.
In fact, it is the person who registered the companies list of company’s register.
So if the company has made any default in filing the registrar the it’s financial statement or annual return for immediately preceding five consecutive financial years.
It’s the case of 1882 where a company was formed for the purpose of manufacturing coffee from date under a patent which was to be granted by the government of Germany.
I repeat here the company was formed for the purpose of manufacturing coffee from date under the patent which was to be granted by the government of Germany.
Also for working other patents of similar kind.
The German patent was never granted and the company embarked upon other patents, but on the petition of a shareholder it was held that this substratum of the company had failed and it was impossible to carry out the objects for which it was formed and therefore it was just an equitable that the company should be wound up.
So obviously when a company which is running on a certain rope and if it its balance then a company will automatically fall down.
And other is losses, losses implement that if a company is suffering a loss or if the company is not earning profits.
Situations are different suffering losses is one thing and not earning profit in another thing but when a company cannot carry forward its business except bearing the burden of losses that it is just an equitable for the company to be wind up.
The Bombay High Court observed in the case of Shah Steamship Navigation Company, Re.
Shahs Steamship Navigation Company, Re this case of 1901.
In this case the court has observed that the court will not be justified in making a making a winding up order merely on the ground that the company has made losses, and is likely to make further losses.
Another important risk point is oppression of minority.
That where more than 70% of the company’s funds were being used for object wholly removed from anything within the memorandum and 93% of the shareholders wished to dissociate themselves from the new objects the company was order to be wind up.
Another is the fraudulent purpose.
If the company has been conceived and brought forth in fraud or for illegal purposes, then it is just and equitable to wind up the company.
In Universal Mutual Aid and Poor Houses Association vs A.D.Thoppa Naidu, I repeat Universal Mutual Aid and Poor Houses Association vs A.D Thoppa Naidu the case of 1933.
Here the Madras High Court observed where the main object of a company is to conduct is a conduct of a lottery or any other illegal purpose.
The mere fact that some of its objects were philanthropic will not prevent the company from being order to be wound up as being one form for an illegal purpose.
So, if a company formed for an illegal purposes whose initial whose main or basic objects are illegal ,unlawful then such a case any philanthropic activity or action or nature can will not prevent the company from being order to be wound up.
So, these were the basic grounds on the basis of which the compulsory wound up can take place.
Now we will discuss the consequences of winding order.
when a company who is running since a long time and suddenly they are going to demolish or they are going to wind up their business obviously there are some consequences there are people who have to suffer the loss or the consequences of the winding up.
The main consequences are that order of winding up is deemed to be notice of discharge of the officers, employees and workmen of the company except when the business of the company is continued for the beneficial winding up of the company.
This is given in section 277 sub section 3 of the act.
Another major consequences that all actions and suits against the company are stayed, unless the Tribunal gives leave to continue or commence proceedings.
Further any sort of proceeding pending in any other court shall be transferred to the Tribunal in which the winding up of the company is proceeding.
So these are the major consequences.
Further the order of winding up is operates in the interest of all the creditors and all the contributories, no matter who in fact asked for it, Section 278.
All the powers of the board of directors cease and the same are then exercisable by the liquidator.
On the commencement of winding up the limitation remains suspended in favour of the company till one year after the winding up order is made.
This is given in section 358 of the Companies Act.
Any disposition of the property of the company, and any transfer of shares in the company or alteration in the status of members made after the commencement of the winding up order will be considered as void.
This is given is section 334 of the Companies Act.
Further any attachment, distress or execution put in force, without leave of the Tribunal, against the estate or effects of the company after the commencement of the winding up shall be void ,but not for the recovery of any tax or impost or any dues payable to government.
Further any floating charge created within 12 months immediately preceding the commencement of winding up is void unless it is proved that the company after the creation of the charge was solvent.
Now these were the consequences of compulsory winding up, now the consequences of voluntary winding up.
Three main consequences which have to be faced by the others in case of voluntary winding up, first is effect on the status of company.
The company shall cease to carry on it business accept if it is required to secure a beneficial winding up.
There is a case that is Wills vs Association of Universities of British Common Wealth 
this is the case of 1964.
It was observed in this case that ‘beneficial winding up’ is not confined to financial benefit only.
It may be for reconstruction and the business may have to be carried on so as to facilitate the smooth taking over.
Board’s power to cease: On the appointment of the liquidator, all the power of the board of directors cease and went into the hands of the liquidator.
Then avoidance of transfers, this is section 334 of the act.
All transfers of shares and alterations in the status of members made after the commencement of winding up are void, unless sanctioned by the liquidator or the transfer is made to the liquidator.
Last but not the least discharge of employees, section 334.
A resolution to wind up voluntarily operate as notice of discharge to the employees of the company.
So it was a basic discussion on the topic of winding up of the company, its needs, its grounds and its effects.
Thank you.
Hello everyone!
Welcome to MOOCs Corporate law courses.
I am Vidhi Madan Chadda, working as an Assistant Professor Law at VIPS affiliated to IP University Delhi.
I will be dealing with this module on meetings of the company this module on meetings of companies encompasses the concept of meetings and its significance for an incorporated entity.
This module will particularly delve into the concept of various company meetings and their significance in the conduct of the business of the company and their relevance towards the stakeholders of the company.
The module will further cover the procedural compliances with respect to convening and holding a meeting as required under the provisions of the Company Law, present Company Law that is Companies Act, 2013.
Learning Objectives: To conduct the business of a company and to decide upon various strategies for future various stakeholders have to meet and to decide upon the same.
This module will facilitate the students to understand the concept of company meetings and their benefits.
Different stakeholders in a company interact through various platforms.
Hence, various kinds of companies are convened in a company to transact business of the company.
This module will illustrate these kinds of company meetings like the members meetings, meetings of board of directors; other meeting like creditor meetings and class meetings.
Not every kind of stakeholders’ gatherings constitutes a valid meeting.
Only those meetings which are held in compliance and consonance with the provisions of the Companies Act, 2013 and the rules appended thereto constitute a valid meeting from the point of view of decision making.
The module will deliberate upon such procedures and the rules.
Learning Outcomes: This module will facilitate the students to, number one – understand the concept of company meetings and their significance in the conduct of business of the company.
Further to understand various kinds of company meetings and their importance.
Finally, to understand the procedures to be complied with as per the Companies Act, 2013 and the rules attached for conducting and convening a valid meeting.
Before we move on to the concept of company meetings and their significance let us first understand what exactly we mean by the term company or other meetings.
The term meeting has not been defined under any of the provision of the company legislation whether it is 1956 Act or 2013 Act.
Therefore, the term meeting has has been given various interpretations by the judicial diktat and thereby it has the possibility of having a variety of shapes and used hues.
However, traditionally a meeting constitutes a gathering or coming together of two or more persons for transacting lawful business.
Company Meetings: Every meeting or gathering of stakeholders of a company would not be regarded as a valid meeting for the purpose of taking binding decisions.
Only those meetings of the companies which are convened and held in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act, 2013 and rules like: IT companies meeting of the board and its power rules 2014 and the companies management and administration rules, 2014 are to be considered in order to constitute a valid meeting.
A number of meetings are convened by a company in its due course and I generally classified as meetings of the members, directors meetings and other meetings.
Companies Act, 2013 has also brought about a number of changes in regulation of meetings.
The focus as we know of the Companies Act, 2013 has been to enhance transparency, increase accountability, shareholders democracy and protection of investors’ interest.
Thereby procedural compliances have been simplified like requirement of holding a statutory meeting by a public company at the time of commencement of its business has been done away with.
Further, to give wider to have increased participation by the members of the company.
The concept of e-meeting or other e-voting has been introduced by the Companies Act, 2013.
There can be various kinds of member meetings like: the Annual General Meeting and extra ordinary general meetings.
There can be directors meeting in the form of board meetings and the committee meetings.
The board of directors may constitute committees as required by the Companies Act, 2013 whereby those committees can have hold their meetings.
And there can be other meetings like: class meetings that is of certain class or classes of members and further creditors meetings.
We will begin with the members meeting first and take up Annual General Meetings.
Each year every company is required to hold at least one meeting of its member which is known as an Annual General Meeting.
The only exemption is given to the one-person company from holding such Annual General Meeting.
First Annual General Meeting is required to be held within 9 months from the date of close of first financial year of the company.
This means that a financial year that is from 1st, April to 31st, March each year wherein upon the close of financial year that is 31st, March till 9 months, that is 31st, December, the 1st AGM of the company should be held and then in the first year of incorporation another AGM is not required.
Subsequent Annual General Meetings are required to be held within a period of 6 months from the close of every financial year that is from 31st, March will count these 6 months which come up to 30th, September each year this is the time span within which the Annual General meetings must be held in a company.
There is no extension given if there is any delay in holding the first Annual General Meeting.
However, in cases of subsequent Annual General Meetings, the registrar on sufficient cause being shown by the company may extend the time, period for holding such Annual General Meeting and that is the maximum of 3 months from the time which it was required to hold such meeting.
Provision of the Companies Act also prescribed for the date time and venue on which the meeting is to be held.
An Annual General Meeting can be held on any day except the National Holiday.
Here, by National Holiday we mean that they declared as a National Holiday by the Central Government.
It can be held during the business hours that is 9:00 a.m. to 6 p.m. and such meeting can be held either at the registered office of the company and where the registered office of the company cannot accommodate a vast shareholder base then the meeting can also be held at some other place within the same city, town or village in which the registered office of the company is situated.
Section 102 enlists and lists various businesses which are to be necessarily transacted at an Annual General Meeting.
Such items of or businesses are called as ordinary businesses, that is why some times an Annual General Meeting also called as an ordinary meeting.
Such items which are to be transacted at Annual General Meetings include; number 1 – consideration of financial statements, board reports and auditor reports of the companies.
Declaring dividends if any, appointment of directors of the company and appointment and fixation of salary of the auditors of the company besides these four items of ordinary business that are to be transacted at Annual General meeting.
All other businesses which are to be transacted are called special businesses.
Any all other meetings, if it is required to be convened and held of all the members of a company then it can be held as an Extraordinary General Meeting.
One meeting is to be held at an Annual General Meeting in each year and in case the company requires to hold and take such other decisions which require the assent of the members then in those cases an Extraordinary General Meeting of the members can be convened and held till the time the next AGM is held.
All business transacted at an Extraordinary General Meeting are considered as special businesses, like: we discussed all the businesses besides those which are stated under section, 102 are to be treated as special businesses.
So, all those items can be dealt at Extraordinary General Meetings.
These extraordinary General Meeting can be called by the board of directors.
It can also be called by the board of directors on a requisition being made by the shareholders of the company or in case, the board of directors fail to hold such meetings the shareholders who are making requisitions can also go about holding the meeting, the Extraordinary General Meeting themselves.
And in certain cases the Tribunal can also call such meetings.
The shareholders who are making this requisition for holding an Extraordinary General Meeting must possess, at least one tenth of the paid up share capital of the company and where the companies without share capital in such cases those shareholders must possess at least one tenth of the voting powers of the company.
Only this, this much shareholding or the voting power must be held, that is one tenth must be held by the shareholders who are desirous of making a requisition to the board for holding an Extraordinary General Meeting.
The board of directors when they receipt such valid requisition, recognition of the shareholders is considered as valid when it is in writing and signed by those members who want such requisition must call the Extraordinary General Meeting within 21 days and the date of meeting in any case must not be later than 45 days from such requisition.
They must call a General Meeting upon receipt of acquisition, the Board must call the extraordinary General Meeting within 21days and the date of meeting must not be later than 45 days from the date of receiving such requisition.
In case these deadlines that is 21 days and 45 days are not met by the board of directors.
The shareholders making the requisition for such meeting may go ahead to call and hold shareholders meeting themselves.
They can do so within 3 months from the date of requisition of such meeting.
All the reasonable expenses which are incurred by such requisitioning shareholders for holding such meeting, like: the registered office for holding such meeting, notices are to be given, everything whatever expenses reasonable expensive they make are to be reimbursed to such members by the company.
Such reimbursement is made by the company by detecting such amounts from the fees of the defaulting directors.
The directors which could not make the meeting held within those deadlines.
There have been numerous judicial pronouncements in this regard, like: in LIC of India versus Escorts Limited.
The Supreme Court observed that every shareholder of a company possesses a right to call or to give a requisition for an Extraordinary General Meeting subject to the provisions of the Act.
Once the requisition is made in compliance with the provisions of the Act, the shareholder cannot be restrained from calling such meeting.
Also in R.Chhettiar versus M.Chettiar, the share holders gave a requisition in compliance of the provisions of the Companies Act for removing the Managing Director of the company thereby they wanted to call an Extraordinary General the directors failed to call such meeting with within the prescribed deadlines with time period.
The court held that such a meeting was badly convened.
In certain cases the tribunal may under certain certain circumstances order to hold and convene an extraordinary meeting where it can do so, the tribunal may do so on its own motion or upon receiving an application by the directors on members having the voting rights to call an Extraordinary General Meeting.
The tribunal may give necessary directions to conduct the meeting including the permission for holding one person meetings or through proxy.
There are certain requisites of holding a valid meeting as it stated that in order to convene a meeting or hold a meeting, hold and convene a meeting as prescribed under the provisions and the rules of the act.
The requisites, these requisites are to be complied with in order to transact a valid and binding business for the company.
Notice of the meeting is required to be served to every member of the company, directors of the company and auditors of the company either in writing or through electronic mode; that is through emails.
The notice is required to be served at least 21 days prior to the date of the meeting.
However, the meetings can even be called at a shorter notice then of these 21 days if 95% of the members agree to such shorter notice for a meeting.
The notice must also provide for the date, time and venue of the meeting along with the agenda of the items which are proposed to be transacted at such meeting.
Another requisite for a valid meeting is the quorum.
That is the minimum requirement of number of members present at meetings for conducting a valid meeting.
That means for conducting a valid meeting and transacting a lawful and binding business, minimum number of members are required to attend the meeting so as to constitute quorum of the meeting.
Quorum of the meeting: In case of private company constitutes two members personally present at the meet and in cases of public company where at the date of meeting the membership of the company is up to one thousand members, then the quorum shall be 5 members personally present.
In public companies where at the date of the meeting the the number of members is from 1,000 but up to 5,000 members, in those cases 15 members personally present constitutes the quorum.
In case of public companies having shareholder base at the date of the meeting more than 5,000 members then the quorum shall constitute 30 members personally present at the meeting.
There is a person a person who is required to preside over the meeting and also to orderly convene the meeting such person is called the chairman of the meeting who is elected by show of hands by the members personally present at meeting.
That means at every meeting by show of hands the members among themselves appoint 1 person as chairman who can then preside over the meeting and conduct the business of the meeting.
In cases where a poll is demanded for electing a chairman, the provisions of this present act would apply for holding such a poll and till the time such chairman is appointed the earlier chairman who was appointed by show of hands will continue as the chairman of the meeting.
A member may attend the meeting personally in person that is in person or through a duly appointed proxy.
Duly appointed proxy means a person in his place who can attend the meeting but such proxy must be duly appointed by the member by giving such notice at least 48 hours before the date the time of such meeting in a written form and put after affixing his signature to it.
And such proxy such person who is being authorised by the member can be any person who can attend such meeting.
However, in cases of associations not-for-profit which are set up under Section 8 of the Companies Act, the proxy must also be the member of the company.
That means a member who is appointing a proxy can only appoint another member to participate in the meeting of the company on his behalf.
The proxy however does not possess a right to speak at such meeting nor he is entitled to vote except in case of poll is called.
A member can revoke his proxy by furnishing a notice to that effect that to in writing to the company.
In order to transact the business a meeting is called and for having a decision is being taken at the meeting there is a requirement of voting that means a member can vote against or in favour of a decision.
Members Per se have a Right to Vote.
Such right to vote at the meetings can only be restricted by the articles of the company, when in cases there are shares which are partly paid or there there exist lien on such shares.
Only in those cases the right to vote of the members can be restricted.
Voting can take place by show of hands.
When a resolution or a decision is to be taken at a General Meeting, voting generally takes place by show of Hands by the members unless members requisition for a pole or voting is happening through electronic means.
Such voting by show of hands is evidence through the declaration which is made by the chairman at the end of the meeting and the minutes which provide for such decision is being taken.
Another new initiative that has been taken up by this new Act is allowance of voting which is to be held by electronic means, that means that in order to have maximum participation of the members e-votings are also allowed after the new act coming into being.
The Central Government may prescribe in accordance with rule 20, certain rule 20 of companies management and administration rules, 2014 certain class or classes of company and also the manner in which these companies may vote through the members of these companies may vote through electronic means.
E-voting is to be mandatorily followed according to these rules by the listed companies and also by unlisted companies having more than 1000 .
companies besides these which are mandatory required can also voluntarily allow their members to carry out votings at the meeting through the electronic means.
Demand for a poll, at anytime the poll may be either ordered by the chairman suo moto or may be demanded by the number of person as prescribed under the section where the resolution is to be passed through poll.
The chairman shall require assistance of certain person called the scrutinizes to scrutinize the words that have been made through the polling process and the rules prescribed that is section 109 read with rule 21 of the company’s management and administration rules 2014 prescribed the chairman has the power to regulate the poll in accordance with said rules.
The voting can also take place by the process of postal ballot.
However, following items of business cannot be transacted through the process of postal ballot as they hold higher importance as against other matters, like: the issue of shares with differential rights, the alteration of object clause of the memorandum and the alteration of the main objects of the memorandum, change of place of registered office outside the local limits, buyback of shares of the company, election of the directors and such other matters cannot be passed through a postal ballot.
The decisions taken by the members through voting can be passed either through ordinary resolution, special resolution.
An ordinary resolution is one, when the votes casted in favour exceed the votes casted against them.
Here, the members can either vote in person or through proxy.
Ordinary resolutions are said to be passed to when the votes casted in favour of the decision exceed the votes casted against them that is by simple majority.
Here the members can port either in person, or through their proxy.
The resolutions can also be passed especially where the notice is required to be given in such regard by specifying that it is a special resolution.
The notice must really state that the decision is to be passed at the meeting by special resolution.
Here, the votes casted by the eligible members must be at least three times in favour against the vote casted of such resolution.
And there can be resolution which requires special notice which whereby according to section 115 any such notice is required to be given shall be brought at the instance of the member holding not less than one percent of the total voting power in case of company not having share capital or members holding shares on an aggregate some of exceeding rupees 5 lacs paid up on the date of the notice.
Rule 23 further provides the time and means of sending such special notices for passing the resolution.
The details of the meetings are to be kept in the form of the minutes of the meetings as prescribed under the section and the rules appended and the companies are required to keep and maintain true and fair records of the proceedings of the meetings in the form of minutes in accordance with the act, rules and the secretarial standards as well.
Minutes must be signed by the chairman of the meeting within 30 days of the conclusion of such meeting.
The minutes have the evidentiary value for the proceedings which have taken place at the meetings and thereby recorded in such minutes.
Now, we move on to the meetings of the board of directors wherein board of directors for transacting day to day business activities of the company are required to meet at time intervals as prescribed under the provisions.
Section 173 requires that a board meeting shall be held within 30 days of the incorporation of the company that means within 30 days of incorporation of the company the board of directors are required to meet and hold and convene a board meeting.
Thereafter at least 4 board meetings must be held every year with not more than 120 days gap between two successive board meetings.
So, usually each quarter must have meeting of board of directors.
Such board of director meetings can be either held in person or through video conferencing or any other audio visual means.
That means even the directors who are not personally present at the meeting can take part in the proceedings of the meeting through the availability of these audio visual and video conferencing means.
However, there are certain matters which cannot be dealt through the video conferencing mode.
The notice of all such director meetings must be sent to all the directors at least 7 days prior to the date of the meetings.
However, if all the directors agree to a shorter notice than 7 days as prescribed, they can go ahead with the shorter notice as well for calling such meetings.
Then, there are certain meetings which are held of the committees which are constituted of the board of directors, like: the CSR committee which is required for taking decisions as regards the CSR policy of a company.
It shall comprise such committees, usually comprise of minimal 3 of the directors of one happens to be the independent director.
Such CSR committee meetings have to be held at regular intervals so that they can deliberate upon the CSR policy of the company.
Further there are the audit committee meetings which wherein audit committee happens to be a mandatory committee in case of a listed company and also prescribe classes of public company which require to setup this audit committee for the requirement of seeing the remuneration and taking decisions as regards the auditors of the company; and in such cases the meetings can be held for such audit committee members.
Then, there are nomination and remuneration committee which usually take decision as regards the reasonableness and sufficiency of the level of remuneration which is decided for the board of directors whether it is adequate or not and also their required to hold meetings at regular intervals.
Besides these there are other meetings like class meetings and creditor meetings.
First we will begin with the class meetings.
These are those those company meetings which are held for a particular section of members only.
Only those members which are holding shares of a particular class are required to attend and vote at the meetings to pass such resolutions which become binding upon them.
Such meetings are held only when the rights of such members are to be altered or affected.
For instance, under section 48 of the act wherein the variation of shareholder rights can take place to such class of members are only required to attend such meeting and pass the resolutions by passing a special resolution to this effect.
Then, there are creditors meetings, these type of meetings are held for both secured and unsecured creditors are usually held such creditor meetings are held at the time of approving the scheme of mergers as required under section 232 of the Companies Act, 2013 or at the time and also at the time of company when it is going into voluntary winding up then also the member of the meeting of the creditors are to be held and convened.
Summing up, in this module on company meetings we have covered the concept of concept of meetings and their significance for the conduct of business in a company in an orderly manner.
Various kind of company meetings, like: the member meetings, director meetings, class meetings and creditors meetings; relevance of all such kinds of meetings for the stakeholders of the companies.
The procedural compliances as laid down under the present act and rules appended thereto are discussed for which are required for convening a valid meeting for purposes of taking valid and binding decisions of the company.
Thank you.
Hello everyone!
welcome to MOOCs corporate law course.
I'm Vidhi Madaan Chadda working as an Assistant Professor law at VIPs affiliated to IP University Delhi.
I will be dealing with the module on types of companies.
This module on types of companies is in continuation to the incorporation process wherein the students will get to know about the various kinds of companies which can be incorporated in the Indian context.
The focus of the module would be to discuss the benefits and the nature of these kinds of companies.
The module will further delve into the nature and functioning of these kinds of companies along with their procedural requirements for incorporation.
The objectives of this module would be to understand various kinds of companies, their nature and the relevance for choosing such forms of businesses.
Further, it would make the students understand that what are the legal provisions and the regulatory Framework governing these kinds of companies under the Indian Company legislations.
Also on what basis these companies can be classified.
Further, the differences in natures and kinds in their kinds can be enunciated.
The learning outcomes of this module would be that is it will enable the students to understand various kinds of companies and their classification.
It will make them understand the features of each of these kinds of companies along with the benefits of incorporating and choosing such forms of business structures and they will understand the differences in their nature and structure of these companies.
We'll start with the introduction and overview of the module, that is, various business structures can come into existence and be opted for depending upon their size, nature, scope and membership in an organization.
Incorporation makes an entity, a distinct person in the eyes of law; having perpetual succession, power to acquire, hold, dispose of the property in its own name, to sue and be sued in its own name by virtue of section 9 of the Companies Act 2013.
The companies in India can either be incorporated under the Companies Act 2013 or under any previous legislations like the Companies Act 1956 and or under the special legislation prescribing for the setting up of these companies.
The choice between incorporating a public company or a private company is generally based upon a number of factors like scale of operations, sources of funds, autonomy needed, flexibility of operations and such other kinds.
These kinds of companies can be loosely categorized on or rather classified on different basis.
They can be classified on the basis of their incorporation; they can be either registered as a statutory company or a registered company; they can be classified on the basis of membership like it can be a public company or a private company or a one person company.
They can be categorized on the basis of their liability that is unlimited company, company limited by shares or company limited by guarantee or company or unlimited company; then there can be other companies like holding and subsidiary companies, government company, foreign company and few new types of companies which are introduced by the Companies Act 2013 like the associate companies, the dormant companies and so on.
Section 3 subsection 1 of the Companies Act 2013 provides for the incorporation and registration of three kinds of companies namely public company, private company and one person company.
We’ll start with private companies first.
Private company is a company which is incorporated with a minimum number of two members for carrying out any lawful activity.
Earlier under the previous company law that is Companies Act 1956 there was a requirement of minimum authorized capital Rs. 1 lakh which has been done away with the coming of Companies Amendment Act of 2015 any minimum prescribed, authorized capital.
Private company unlike the public ones are from inviting deposits of funds from the public or accepting funds from the public at large; hence this company companies enjoy a number of privileges in the form of relaxation from compliances.
There is a requirement of having minimum to directors on the board of private companies.
There are a number of privileges that accrue to a private company.
They can be that they are not required to appoint an independent director or a woman director on their board.
They are not required to required to retire a a proportion of their directors each year.
The provisions of voting regulations like quorum, notice cannot be complied with stricter senso, and they can have their own internal regulations as prescribed by the articles of the company.
They are not required to prepare report for the annual general meetings and there is no need for having a secretarial audit for private companies.
Companies Act 2013 has introduced two other types, two new types rather of private companies; that is a one-person company and a small company.
We’ll start with one-person company first; it is a new concept that is introduced whereby a small or a micro entrepreneur can now be in a position to convert their proprietorship firm a small unit into a corporate entity, a corporate setup without worrying about number of or other Complex compliance regime or procedural requirements which are set out under the company legislations.
There are a number of benefits which accrue to one-person company.
They are that these kind of companies are not required to hold any annual general meetings or extraordinary general meetings.
They are not required to appoint any independent directors on their board, only two board meetings in a calendar year, that is, each meeting in the half year is what they are required to hold for the board of directors and further they are not required to prepare a cash flow statement as a part of their financial statements.
Next or rather another kind of new private company, or business firm that has been introduced by the Companies Act 2013 is a small company.
The ideology behind setting up of the small company was to give some relief to the small business setups, small entities given them flexibility of operation, flexibility by giving them simplified procedures and statutory compliances for their internal regulation.
The small companies are a private company which are usually categorized as small on the basis of their turnover and the paid-up share capital.
A small company means a company which is other than a public company where the paid-up share capital does not exceed Rs.50 lacs and such higher amount that may be prescribed but it cannot be at any time be more than 5 crores or the of which as per the last profit and loss account does not exceed Rs.
2 crores or such higher amount as may be prescribed but it cannot be more than 20 crores at any point in time.
There are number of benefits which are given to small companies in terms of regulatory relaxations and lesser compliance requirements like they are not required to appoint more than two directors on their board.
They are not required to appoint independent or women directors.
The report of an annual general meeting is not to be prepared, also the preparation of cash flow statement as a part of financial statements is not required.
We move on to another type of company that can be incorporated that is a public company.
A public company is an association of 7 or more members who subscribe to the memorandum and there is no limit that, that is, the maximum limit on the number of members a public company can have.
There is no requirement after the Amendment Act of 2015 on the public companies as regards the authorized capital.
Earlier, the act prescribed for a limit of Rs.5 lacs as authorized Capital.
Public companies have to affix the word Limited after their name.
all the companies except the private companies are called the public once.
After the Companies Act 2013 undoubtedly the requirement and the standards for transparency, accountability, governance have increased.
This in turn has increase the number of compliances a public company has to undergo.
Few of the compliances like appointment of independent directors, women directors, formation of various committees like nomination committee, remuneration committee etc cetera, then appointment of whole time directors, key managerial personnel, requirement of secretarial audit to name a few.
The increased compliance cost plays down heavily upon these public companies which are held by smaller group of shareholders.
When the smaller group of shareholders have to be at the brunt of these exemplary compliance cost is cost as per the new act, they prefer, the data shows that they have been preferring to move to another simpler business forms like the limited liability partnership or a private company.
Thus, today a number of public companies having smaller shareholding base find it feasible to convert themselves either into a private company or a limited liability partnership to enhance their operating efficiency.
All these companies, private, public, one-person, small can be either incorporated as a company limited by share, a company limited by guarantee or an unlimited company.
A company limited by share is a company wherein the liability of the members is limited to the extent of the amount which remains unpaid upon their shares.
Thus, the liability arises only in cases of partly paid shares; for instance, a person A is a shareholder in a company whereby he purchases rupee 10 share in that company.
The company till now has called only Rs.8 from that particular shareholder A.
So that means Rs.2 remains balance and his liability towards the company.
So it only in cases of partly paid shares the company can ask to pay up the full amount on those shares the shareholder has prescribed for.
In cases of company limited by guarantee the liability of the members is limited to the extent they undertake to contribute towards the assets of the company but this liability arises only at the time of liquidation or winding up of the company.
It cannot arise any time before it.
Such kinds of companies may or may not have share capital.
Further, there are companies which can have unlimited liability for their members wherein the members become personally liable to discharge the liability of the company even through their personal assets.
However, the members cannot be sued in their personal capacities and their liability also arises at the time of winding up only.
The basic difference between a member of an unlimited company and a partner of a partnership firm is that a partner of a partnership firm has joint and several liability and he can be sued personally by the claimants whereas as the member of an unlimited company though has an unlimited liability but cannot be sued in his personal capacity by the claimants.
Moreover, at any time the unlimited company can convert itself into a limited company either limited by shares or guarantee.
Then we move onto another kinds of companies which can be setup in India.
There are foreign companies which can be called as a company or a body corporate which are though incorporated outside India but have a presence in India.
This presence in India can be through a place of business in India or by conducting any business activity in India.
This place of business in India can be either through itself, its agent physically or in electronic mode.
Rule 3 of Companies Registration Offices and Fees Rules they have defined the term business activity and chapter 22 of the act they contain section 379 to Section 393 which deal with foreign companies and the procedures they required to follow.
Every foreign company which establishes a place of business is India is required to get registered and file their application in the form prescribed with the registrar of companies pursuant to section 380.
Further, the Indian office of that foreign company is required to prepare a statement of account and shall also cause them to be submitted with the registrar in pursuance of section 381 of the act.
Another kind of company is the government company as prescribed under section 2 subsection 45 of Companies Act 2013.
Government company is a company which has the holding of Central, state or both these governments.
It is a company wherein the Central government the State government or both Central or State or only state government has more than 51% of the paid up share capital; that means these governments hold more than 51% stake in a government company.
And a subsidiary company of a government company is also called as a government company.
Though it has the Holding and control of a government however, it can such companies government companies can at anytime be not equated as state as prescribed under article 12 of the Constitution of India.
There are a number of judicial pronouncements to this effect that the government companies cannot be regarded as a state nor the employees of the government companies be regarded as government employees.
Further, there are another set of companies is called holding and subsidiary companies.
Two companies are called holding and subsidiary of each other when they have a relationship whereby one company possesses and exercises control over the other.
The company which possesses and exercises its control over another company is called the holding company and the company upon which such control is exercised is called the subsidiary company.
The control is set to be exercised by controlling the composition of the board in such another company or by exercising or controlling more than one half of the total share capital in such another company.
Another new concept which has been brought about by the Companies Act 2013 is a concept of associate company.
This new concept is introduced to bring about clarity and transparency in the relationship that two companies share besides the holding and subsidiary relationship.
A company is called as an associate of another when it possesses significant influence over that other company.
The significant influence can be read in terms of the control which is exercised by holding more than or rather at least 26% of the total share capital in that company.
This means that two companies can, wherein one company be associate of another wherein one company is in a position to control the other company or have significant influence over the other company by having at least 26% of the total share capital in that company.
A joint venture can also be covered under the definition of associate company; however, it must not be subsidiary of the company exercising such influence.
Associate company is also considered as a relative in related party transactions under the act.
There are another set of companies which are prescribed under the Companies Act 2013 wherein the companies are per se>(/?) not setup to earn profits or make profits rather they are set up for the purposes of earning for the purposes of furtherance of objects like charitable, religious, educational, social and welfare causes.
These companies are not required to affix the words Private Limited or limited after their names but they acquire their status as an association not for profit only after they procure a license from the central government.
Such companies are given a number of privileges in terms of flexibility of governance and lesser compliances and they are required to convert into some other form only after they are permitted by the central government The members of such companies do not get dividend as their return.
Another kind of companies which are introduced by the Companies Act 2013 are called the dormant companies whereby certain companies which although formed and registered under the act can be given a status of dormant whereby their incorporated for a future project or only to hold an asset or any intellectual property or they have no significant accounting transaction or in case they are inactive company.
And inactive company implies a company which has not been carrying out any business or operation or has not made any significant accounting transaction in the last two financial years or has not filed its statements or annual returns during two financial years.
This means then means that certain companies which are not very active can secure the status of dormant companies to lessen down their compliance requirement.
Such inactive companies have to apply to the registrar of companies to get this dormant status; however; there is no embargo upon these dormant companies from securing and active status anytime later.
Then there are certain companies called the investment companies as provided under Explanation A, to Section 186.
These investment companies have the principal business to acquire securities and further deal in shares and securities.
The earning source for these companies is through the income of dividend or interest which is earned by dealing in the securities or buying and selling of these securities.
One of the latest initiatives in the Indian context is the is towards setting ups these startups.
There has been a clarification provided by the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion wherein the notification provides that a startup entity can only be set up in the form of a private company or a partnership firm or a limited liability partnership.
Moreover, a startup can only be called as one for the first 5 years of its setting up or incorporation or till the time the turnover remains within the cap of Rs. 25 crores during five financial years.
This means that the startups can either be formed as a private company or a partnership firm or a limited liability partnership wherein under the various business forms that we have discussed a startup may choose from these smaller business setups to start functioning.
Summing up, in this module on types of companies we have covered the nature and kinds of these companies which are available of people who are desirous of setting up their business in the Indian scenario.
The benefits of choosing such business forms over the other available options, the procedural requirements for incorporating each of these business setups, and the changes which have been brought about by the Companies Act towards their regulation and certain new forms of business structures like associate companies, one person companies, dormant companies which have been introduced by this present new act.
moving ahead another important term that is called manager.
Manager is defined and it is very significant.
The definition if you read it says an individual, so it is a person, it is a individual who subject to the superintendence, control and direction of the board of directors has the management of the whole or substantially the whole of the affairs of the company and it is important to note.
Here, that what matters is not a person is described as a manager but what he is exercising substantial part of powers of a management.
It is very important to note here.
So, there are three important things which we noting that he must be an individual, it cannot be a company form or other things and he is subject to superintendence control and direction of the Board of Directors.
So, he cannot act independently on its own it has to be always under the superintendence, control and direction of the board of directors and thirdly that he has is the management of whole or substantially the whole of the affairs of the company.
With what does it mean? It means that he is the whole soul in charge.
A shop manager or a factory manager cannot be a manager under the act.
There is no need that manager must be an employee of the company.
So, there is no specific need but he must be an individual.
He must have substantially the whole management of the affairs of a company and must be acting on the superintendence, control and direction of the board.
Now it, I have already pointed out that it cannot be a firm a body corporate or association of person and here we refer to Section 196 of the Companies Act, 2013 and in as far as the manager's role is concerned I would direct you to read this particular decision.
It is pretty interesting decision CIT Kerala versus Alagappa Textiles AIR, 1980 Supreme Court 235.
That in fact this Supreme Court decision in detail discusses this concept of the manager and section 2(53) of the Companies Act, 2013 defines manager and that is what we have seen the definition and right now.
And 3 important points which must be considered as for the definition of Manager is concerned.
Now, let us come down to another term that is called Managing Director.
Now, this Managing Director is an important term and here we need to distinguish it with the manager and here if you see it says a director who is entrusted with substantial powers of management of the affairs of a company by virtue of what, by virtue of three things one either the same thing is mentioned in the articles of association of a company or by way of an agreement with the company or a resolution passed to this regard in a General Meeting by the Board of Directors or by its board of directors through authorisation to General Meetings.
So, they are the 3 modes by which a Director become a Managing Director.
But here it is important to know that the Managing Director is not acting under the supervision or control of board of director.
He is independent in this regard.
That is what we saw in case of manager he has to work under the superintendence, control and supervision of the board of directors.
Secondly, the Managing Director holds the position by virtue of being a director.
So, if he is not a director then he cannot be a managing director.
But, in case of manager it is not like that.
In case of manager he holds the position in his own right as an appoint appointed person as a manager and while Managing Director essentially has to be director before where as manager can continue to be a manager whether or not he holds the office of a director that is what is the distinction I made just now?Now, let us come down to the whole time director.
Now, section 2(94) of the Companies Act, 2013 defines whole time director and it says it includes a director in the whole time employment of a company and it may be noted that the director may be appointed as a chief executive officer, manager, company secretary or chief financial officer, if so provided in the articles of association of a company and would then be treated as the whole time director.
So basically, whole time director means a person or a director who is in the whole time employment of a company.
He has to devote full time or full time to the company and he can be designated, he can be appointed as Chief Executive Officer or Manager a Company Secretary or Chief Financial Officer.
So, this is what is about whole time director.
Now, there is a concept of Company Secretary and if we see the Company Secretary is defined.
If CS is appointed by a company to perform the functions of a Company Secretary under the Companies Act and every listed company and others having a paid up capital of 5 crores or more will have to appoint a Company Secretary.
That is what we have seen previously and though the secretary’s duties are largely of a ministerial or administrative nature.
We must be knowing about the company secretaries duty it plays a very important role in corporate governance.
Corporate governance basically you know that you have a proper accounting and accountability towards the shareholders and this company secretary defined in section 224 and this draws the definition from the company secretaries act and which means a person who is a member of the Institute of Company Secretaries of India.
So, he is a company secretary basically.
Then, there is a term called CFO that is Chief Financial Officer and these are very important term defined in section 219 of the Companies Act and if you see CFO means a person appointed as the Chief Financial Officer of a company.
So here, you can make a distinction between CFO and CEO.
In CEO we saw he is a designated person designated officer of a company where CFO is appointed as Chief Financial Officer of a company.
So, he is an officer who is appointed.
He is not just designated like CEO.
So, it basically says core management team.
What is core management team? This does not include board of directors because board of directors is excluding that is a policy making body of a company.
So, it comprises of all members of the management just one Level below to the executive director.
So, that is basically these are all functional heads who are there and who will be heading the functional units of or you can say SBU’s of the company and they will be dealing with the management, core management of the company.
So, these are the terminologies and this is what are important types of terminologies which we see? Now, let us come down to types of directors.
Now, section 149 of the Companies Act says company needs to have a board of directors.
Now which are they? The board of directors generally the composition of the board of directors includes executive and non executive directors; we will see what is the distinction between executive and non executive directors.
Now, the differentiation which stands between the executive and non executive directors is by way of corporate governance principles.
If you recollect the executive and non executive directors were not exactly defined under Companies Act.
They take their particular definition or this concept has an emergence from corporate governance principles wherein they say that the management of the company must have at least 50% of the board of members who are non executive means they are not part of the day –to-day activities or policy making of a company.
This was under clause 49 of listing agreement previously.
But now what has happened is, is listing agreement has now been replaced with SEBI regulations and this SEBI listing obligations and disclosure requirement actually talks about listing regulations.
And regulation 17 provides for the board of directors which mandates the similar thing that is 50% of the board must comprise of non-executive directors.
You would be aware about the number of directorship which company must have and minimum and maximum numbers.
So, as per the types of companies you know one person company there is one minimum director and maximum can be 15.
Similarly, for private company there must be minimum two directors and maximum 15 and for public company minimum is 3 directors and maximum can be 15 and in case of producer companies which is a interesting addition in the Companies Act, 2013.
Though not edition we can say this has been actually taken from 1956 Act and re-introduced into the 2013 Act exactly have must have a minimum of 5 directors and maximum of 15 directors.
Now, here these directorship can be increased more than 15 if they want but for that they have to pass a special resolution and by way of that only that it can be increased these are the types of directors which we are talking about.
Now, let us exactly talk about different terms which are used in context of types of director.
Now, let to begin with let us come down to executive and non executive directors.
I have talked about this a bit briefly in the previous slide.
Not let us talk about in detail it says the term executive director has been defined to mean a whole time director as per are the companies specification of definition detail rules 2014.
So, who is executive director? Executive director means a whole time director and who is the whole time director? We have seen the definition previously that he is a director who is in the whole time employment of a company.
So, basically executive directors in whole time employment of a company.
Now, the difference between the executive and non executive director lies in their being internal and external to the organisation and their involvement in day-to-day management of the company that is where I drew the distinction upon and as per the Kumar Mangalam Birla Committee report on Corporate Governance.
This was one of the important reports which laid down the foundations for corporate governance.
We see the executive directors like: Director Finance, Director Personnel are involved in day-to-day management of the companies.
The non executive directors bring external and wider perspective and Independence to the decision making and that is where we say the difference between executive and non executive directors of the board.
Always needs to be a Non Executive Director but again there is a composition thing here, if it is 50%, 50%, 50% are executive and 50% are non executive then chairman of the board needs to be a non executive.
What if it is two third compositions is executive, non executive and one third is non executive, executive.
Then, in that particular situation chairman can be a non executive.
So, it depends upon the composition.
Idea is that there should be ideal balance between the executive and non executive directors.
Independent directors.
Now this is a very significant definition and if you see section 149(6) of the Act talks about independent directors And Companies Act, 2013 has brought a very detailed proposition for independent directors and they have laid down their duties and responsibilities of independent directors which was not there in the previous Companies Act and that is why you can see the role of independent directors in scandals like: Satyam has been brought to for that independent directors did not act and there was no responsibility statement for these particular independent directors and that is why these changes have been made under the Companies Act 2013 and we see that an independent director has been exhaustively defined to mean a director other than the managing director or a whole time director or a nominee director.
So, these are not independent directors because they will have some stake or interest in the company.
For example Managing Director will be managing the affairs.
So, he cannot be independent.
Whole time director will be the employment of the company, so he cannot be independent.
Similarly nominee director will be representing the interests of the entity for which, which it is a nominee.
So it will not be independent, hence they cannot be independent directors.
An independent director in the opinion of the board is a person of integrity and possesses relevant expertise and experience.
Now, these are the two terms which are very important he must have, he should be a person of integrity, though objective because we cannot define what is integrity and possess relevant expertise and experience .
So, that is why there are lot of training happening on independent Directors, IOD portal, all those particular things do independent directors training .
Further he is a person who is or was not a promoter of a company or its holding subsidiary or associate company and he is also not related to promoters of directors in company, its holding subsidiary or associate company.
Moving ahead, independent directors must not have any pecuniary relationship.
On this, there is a big focus because it says that it must not have a pecuniary relationship with the company, its holding, subsidiary of associate company or their promoters or directors during the two immediate preceding financial years or during the current financial year.
So, he must not have a pecuniary interest because their stems the Independence.
If he is having a pecuniary interest then definitely he cannot be independent, then and also one of whose relatives has or had pecuniary relationship or transaction with the company, its holding and subsidiary, or their promoters or director.
So, relatives are also not allowed too.
Amounting to what is the pecuniary transaction? Pecuniary transaction is 2% or more of its gross turnover or total income or 50 lakh rupees or such higher amount as may be prescribed.
So, it can be less than 2% like for example that is not significant pecuniary relationship.
For example somebody has got a gift from a company like a small gift of rupees 5000 rupees.
Now, that cannot be 2% of the turnover or it cannot be 50 lakh rupees so that cannot be treated as independent directors.
So, it is said that, that is not a significant pecuniary relationship to influence the decision of a director.
There are ethical issues here.
But we are not going to discuss that here because that is something which is dealt with by secretarial standards and that is not the purport of this particular session.
We will discuss it sometime next and this is what is important? So, one is relationship.
It should be independent, integrity and pecuniary relationship should not be there.
