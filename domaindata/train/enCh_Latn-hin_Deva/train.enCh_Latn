So , these fragments now can be used to analyze further using N - terminal sequencing , so one by one you can determine the , first you determine the sequence of the fragment followed by the sequence determination of the whole amino acid , whole polypeptide chain .
So , you can see here directly .
Where , if you remember the upper fifty and the lower fifty kilo Dalton domain come close and the nucleotide binding site is open and that is how the nucleotide exchange takes place easily and where the ATP enters into the myosin .
So , in the case of fructose if the hydroxyl group at C five reacts with the carbonyl group at C two it leads to the generation of a cyclic structure of fructose which is called as fructofuranose .
Most radicals are comparatively reactive, but some, such as nitric oxide (NO) can be stable.
When a compound has more than one component, then they are divided into two classes, the electropositive and the electronegative components.
And in the second one, this is again very important.
So , polysaccharides can be linear or branched .
So now , come back to this figure on the left side .
As I described before , the pattern of amino acids are glycine X Y , so glycine , the one third of total amino acids in collagen is glycine and X and Y residues are generally proline and hydroxyproline .
The drug has a chlorine ion as an halogen , which binds to this halogen binding site and prevents the movement of this helices .
Hypsochromicity is the shift towards lower wavelength or blue shift .
pk is ionization constant when you come across of the amino acids or any other as I just mentioned about glycine.
So, a strong acid when you talk about, it could be a weak acid or a strong acid.
And another method which is really revolutionized the immunology is the preparation of monoclonal antibodies .
There are different post translation modification and cross links in collagen fibers which gives strength to these fibers .
If the hydrogen bonds were not so important then we would not expect alpha helices and beta sheets in the protein structure .

So , the chain of carbohydrate can be constructed by substitution of a terminal carbon hydrogen bond with increasing number CH two OH units .
So that change , one change in amino acid can lead to a structural change so much so that there is a hydrophobic chain hydrophobic site chain of the valine comes on to the externally exposed on to the service , which does not allow the cell to structure to form globular structure and therefore , the the hemoglobin no longer stays in the globular shape and therefore it does not bind to the oxygen as it is supposed to be .
Second thing is that D N A can form in unusual structures like D N A triple helix.
Basically , it ' s a two parallel kind of actin polymers , which twist itself to form a longer F - actin structure .
So you have to remember , that saturated fatty acids are flexible , they pack tightly together and so they form a solid at room temperature and their melting point increases with an increase in their molecular mass or with an increase in the number of carbon residues in the hydrocarbon chain .
Now , coming to the harmful effects of cholesterol .
Alpha keratin is one of the classical example of alpha helical rich fibrous protein .
Now, the polysaccharides, the moment you think of it, you think of cellulose, think of the glycogen, then you have amylase and all those things amyloid effect and how these are all different and also the the polysaccharide which are not simple polysaccharides, but also complex polysaccharides.
But we can also argue the other way .
In the next one, will be about the R N A .
So, again, you know the carbohydrate of course it is energy source but in addition to that these carbohydrates are part of the complex proteins that are attached to the proteins.
The last two helices are antiparallel and all sequential helices are not adjacent to each other , so they are specially arranged far away .
So , taxonomy is actually gives you the idea about the simply the classification of the organism based on their phenotypic structure or its , so it is mainly used for the organism .
So , basically in other words , if you apply Kiliani - Fischer Synthesis to a sugar solution , to a sugar solution that contains a tetrose , then you will end up getting a pentose and if you start with pentose you will end up getting a hexose .

Could you able to read above these lines in the slides ?
I have shown you on the thing that mechanism of the strength of the protein or the shape of the protein depends on its structure .
In case of , in all these substrate complexes .
This is all early stages, because everyone is still learning about COVID-19, and it may turn out to be correlation without causation, but so far it looks promising.
This helps different organelles to maintain concentrations of substances such as the enzymes, it helps them to maintain the pH and regulate specialized functions very efficiently.
Shown below is the interactions between the two proteins which have a number of salt bridges between them.
On the contrary , the Gram - negative bacteria have thin cell wall that is covered by a complex outer membrane .
Now , based on the number of double bonds the unsaturated fatty acids can further be classified as monounsaturated and as the name suggest this unsaturated fatty acid would have one double bond or they can be classified as polyunsaturated which means that this unsaturated fatty acid can have more than one double bond .
But vitamin D, which is actually a group of fat soluble molecules rather than a single substance, can be synthesised in the body, in our skin.
What is epigenetics ?
Conventional way , the myosin filaments are taken and proteolyzed with different proteases to prepare subfragment one or motor domain .
Long coiled - coil domain two fragment is separated out .
So, when you want to do any experiment under a constant pH or a certain hydrogen ion concentration, you don’t want to, there may be a reaction going on with various interacting molecules then you do not want the buffer to change, the pH to change of the medium you are working on.
We have a lot of those on us, right? 
So , not only glycosidic bonds can form between these two kind of monomers but N - glycosidic bonds are also important in linking ribose to purines and pyrimidines in nucleic acid as shown below in in this figure .
The amyloid beta fragment though generally known to sometimes have a random conformation takes up a anti-parallel beta sheet and tends to oligomerize with the other amyloid beta molecules.
So , the evolution is actually based on the genes and the of course genes encodes proteins , so the and the protein sequence is actually the one factor or essential that can help you to identify or to understand the process of evolution .
However , the overall twist of nucleosomal D N A is only ten point two base pairs per turn , but this varies from nine point four to ten point nine base pairs per turn .

So , there are several proteins which helps in this actin dynamics and treadmilling .
The result is a distorted tetrahedral arrangement in which the H OH angle is 104.5 degrees.
The carbon adjacent to the carboxyl carbon is called an alpha carbon , so as you see here in the structure that this particular fatty acid has eighteen carbon residues and that is why it is called as Octadecenoic acid .
It maintains a physical properties of the cytoplasm, it acts as a dispersion media near the surfaces of the macro-molecules suspended in the cells.
I end up with a water molecule that has come out from these two sugar molecules and then what I can do is , if I connect these two monomers through the oxygen atom that is left on one of the monomers then what I eventually build is a link that is called the glycosidic link , as you can see here which is marked by a red arrow .
So , let ’ s just have a look at the kind of linkages that the G A Gs have with the core protein and the core protein has with the hyaluronate backbone in the proteoglycan aggregate of the extracellular matrix as shown in figure A here .
When proteins become structurally abnormal , thus , disturb the function of the cells , tissues and organs of the body .

They are hydrophobic in nature and they are having affinity for hydrophobic tails of phospholipids on interior of the bilayer .
It is a highly negatively charged molecule and because of this highly negatively charge , highly negative charge on itself it is able to bind to anti - thrombin and this complex of heparin and anti - thrombin is then able to bind to the protease which is thrombin that is essential for blood clotting .
For Glycine it doesn't have a side chain, it doesn't have a pKR value.
Hydrophobic hydration plays a key role in the biological process such as protein folding, membrane formation, ligand binding and even protein stability.
Large myosin motor filaments are called two headed myosin and they are digested with trypsin which leads to a soluble heavy meromyosin .
The repeating nucleosome units are commonly referred to appear as ‘ beads on a string ’ when seen under a microscope .
This is can be understood in terms of the oxy hemoglobin and de - oxy hemoglobin which can be seen and in that normal hemoglobin and oxygen hemoglobin if you have mutant hemoglobin which actually has two protruding sites , the , that protruding sites actually are not so bad , but in compared to its de - oxy hemoglobin , on the right hand side and you see that that happens to it , it creates a two more these things , binding sites .
So , enzymes involved in the synthesis of the C twenty compounds like the P G H two synthase are major drug targets , and like I said aspirin targets this enzyme and blocks the conversion of arachidonic acid to eicosanoids .
Now, normality is defined as a number of gram equivalents.
The most popular and more accepted model is the fluid mosaic model of cell membrane.

Major groove recognition , there are not many small molecules which bind to D N A in the major groove .
The other very important feature of polysaccharides is that they are not synthesized template unlike protein synthesis where you have the m R N A that is being used as a template .
This spermaceti oil is actually a mixture of triacylglycerols and waxes with lots of unsaturated fatty acids .
Metabolically as I mentioned that the CO two actually binds with the amino group of the of the n - terminal amino group and then that binds therefore , makes the NOH two NH two into RNH COO which is shown you the diagram and releases the proton and this proton actually binds to hemoglobin which influences the Hb to unload oxygen .
It was plotted using contact criteria only.
Inhibitors that have been synthesized for C O X - two are collectively referred to as “coxibs ” , such as rofecoxib and celecoxib .

The enantiomer that rotates to the right is dextrorotatory and is designated with the plus sign , so basically the D and the L designations that you have seen before do not represent dextrorotatory and levorotatory .
So , apolipoproteins especially A P O F E four enhance the breakdown of amyloid precursor protein , so amyloid precursor protein is cleaved by a beta secretase and the beta amyloid builds up into plaques .
And , as we have already discussed before because the unsaturation , unsaturated fatty acids are very high in plant oils , it makes them liquid at room temperature while the animal fats have more of saturated fatty acids thereby making them solids at room temperature .
Now , these fibrous structures become insoluble , they again do not dissolve back into the red blood cells and due to which the RBC ’ s become fragile and their carrying capacity of oxygen goes and the those red blood cells are not useful anymore .
The larger molecules flow through the void space .
In general disulfide bonds are unstable in cytosol with few exceptions, we show in this picture schematic representation of formation of a disulfide linkage between the two cysteine amino acids.
So , far we discussed that how to determine the amino acid composition in a peptide and you can see that it can easily be determined by the acid hydrolysis followed by the quantification with the using ninhydrin .
So , few have them I have listed here , you can look into the literature and they also have a special characteristics , each one has a special characteristic , they either they are carbohydrate , linking or their solubility , molecular weight , composition of other amino acids like hydroxylysine changes from one type of collagen to the other type of collagen .
It’s nearly Halloween, right? 
So , rest of the substances which do not have any affinity will come out during washing .

Lipids of the cell membrane are organised in bimolecular lipid sheet with the hydrophilic heads pointing towards the aqueous environment and hydrophobic end of the lipid embedded in the centre .
Cholesterol is an essential structural component of all animal plasma membrane , and its synthesised majorly by all animal cell .
Here , show the structure of Parkin .
What are the centrifuge and how it works ?
The hydrogen bonds are formed between NH group of glycine and carboxyl group of proline of the next chain .
In much similar way, I have provided two examples, hydrogen fluoride and water.
What I said before the long Keratin molecule which , where we have shown the green color segments which are helical regions .
And these loops are very susceptible to proteolysis .
So , sphingolipid contains the following , one molecule of sphingosine or one of its derivative , one molecule of a long chain fatty acid and a polar head group joined by a glycosidic linkage in some cases and a phosphodiester in others .
Out of all these methods , what is more important actually is the E L I S A is a very popular .
Specific heat is the amount of heat that is required or lost to raise or lower the temperature of one gram of substance by one degree Celsius.
Figure B here , you see tetrapeptide of the bacteria staphylococcus aureus .
In the case of fluorescence - based test , the antigen is labelled with a fluorescent dye .
Keratan sulfate on the other hand is present in cornea , cartilage , horns , hair , nails etcetera and they all together play a very important role in the cell .
It ' s generally about three Angstroms .
In the case of radioimmunoassay , the antigen is labelled with radioactivity .
The most common mutation is deletion of five zero eight position , results a basically due to three reciproted deletion in the gene and loss of phenylalanine at this position which causes the dysfunction of this protein .
The other disease epidermolytic hyperkeratosis which is rare skin disease affects about one in two point five million people and this is causes due to mutation in keratin one .
A trillion is a million million (on the short scale, which everyone uses, don’t start), 1,000,000,000,000, or 1012, so 35 trillion is 3.5 x 1013.
The imposing cliffs of Pointe de Hoc overlook the Normandy beaches where Allied troops landed on June 6 1944.
The cleft between one and three is generally where a other proteins bind for the regulation of actin depolymerization and polymerization .
So , from this complexes it reveals that the alternate access transport mechanism which is very important for transporting the glucose across the biological membranes .
These tertiary structures arrange themselves to give a quaternary structures .
The ideal chromatographic separation is affected by fronting and tailing .
And so , they will elute out of the column first and would be fed into the detector which is which is a mass spectrometer in this case .
And understanding of these is a very important because whenever you are doing any experiment, pH is an important measurement that has to be maintained.
I mean the term itself explains so well that it takes care of the, it acts actually as a sync or it will give it if it is required in a small range that has to be remembered.
And this can lead to band broadening .
So you have the serotonin LeuT transporter with a leucine substrate bound at the cavity of the Leu transporter .
In the scope of its subject, chemistry occupies an intermediate position between physics and biology.
Among the beta sheet structures we have discussed about the beta barrel structures , and how Greek key containing domains can also form a beta barrel structures .
So , this seems to be is actually responsible further extra center of collagen fiber where one extra hydrogen bond is seen between the polypeptides through water .
So , while the lipids are getting separated from gas liquid chromatography , they enter into the mass spectrometer where they are analyzed and identified by their unique fragmentation pattern .
The transition between the two is a slow process which impede protein folding .
The ligands could be an ion, metal ion and it could be a drug or it could be any other you know if it is an enzyme it has its own substrate.
Basically , as we say hydrophobic , the water repelling property , so they repel water and interact with each other .
So , large plaques seems to be responsible for neurotoxicity , once this bundle is formed and they are actually responsible for neurotoxicity .
You can see that how the tree construction proceeds .
So with this you have understood the general protein structure in this week.
A fine human hair is about 0.05 mm across, which means a mole of (fine) hair would be 3.01 x 1019 metres thick.
But structure function relationship nevertheless plays a vital role in understanding the physiological function as well as pathology .
So , that is how it is we call it as a cooperative substrate binding .
So , when it is unloading or releasing oxygen it helps to ,
First, we have the ionic bond, which are very strong, then we have the covalent bond, metallic bond, ion dipole, hydrogen bond, dipole-dipole interaction, ion induced dipole interaction, dipole induced dipole interaction and finally London dispersion forces.
