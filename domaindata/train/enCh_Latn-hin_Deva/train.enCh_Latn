Testosterone is synthesized by the testis , while the estradiol is synthesized by the ovaries .
So, the first is the common and some of the uncommon one.
Therefore , what happens
So, what have we learnt today students?
So , let us just have a look at now how two monomers are brought together and linked through a glycosidic link and basically it is this glycosidic linkage that connects one sugar molecule to the other , to the third , to the fourth , so on and so forth and is basically connecting all the sugar molecules and is the basis for the synthesis of oligosaccharides or polysaccharides .
Because when it needs to be mobilized for energy utilization of the body , the degradative enzymes can add act upon the number , the enumerable branch points that are present in glycogen .

So , stearic acid is one of the most common saturated fatty acids that you will come across in the textbooks .
The next picture shows daunomycin - D N A structure .
Now , based on the number of double bonds the unsaturated fatty acids can further be classified as monounsaturated and as the name suggest this unsaturated fatty acid would have one double bond or they can be classified as polyunsaturated which means that this unsaturated fatty acid can have more than one double bond .
The only reason and both of them exist in the D form , because the hydroxyl group that is positioned at C three is placed on the right hand side just like D - glyceraldehyde .
What is the difference between an aldose and a ketose ?
If you look at linolenic acid which has three double bonds but eee the same number of carbon atom as in stearic acid , you see that the melting point has gone down to minus seventeen degree Celsius , which indicates that the lower the degree of saturation , the lower would be the melting point .

Amino acids which have charged chains like serine, threonine, glutamine, asparagine and special amino acids cysteine, selenocysteine, glycine, proline and lastly a group of hydrophobic amino acids and those having aromatic rings in their side chains.
So , if you look at the structural role of these oligosaccharides , so these oligosaccharides they are attached to protein sequence at regions that form surface loops or turns and because these oligosaccharides are hydrophilic in nature they project away from proteins thereby creating a shield around the protein surface and because this shield is created by these oligosaccharides , the protein surface is protected from proteolysis .
And this explains why long periods of inactivity can cause the cartilage to become thin and fragile .
The bifunctional amino acids have an additional pKR value for their side chains.

So , the function regulation of these enzymes like catalysis , defence mechanisms , transport of ions or a transport of small molecules , signal transduction , all of them actually function based on different structural aspects and therefore different diversity in the function .
Myristic acid , palmitic acid , arachidic acid , etcetera .
And , if you using methanol , very polar or charged lipids will be eluted first .
So , besides serving as energy deports T A G s also serve as insulators in animals like Seals , Penguins and are very important for hibernating animals .
So , while glycosaminoglycans are an important constituent of the extracellular matrix in the cell and are examples of hetero polysaccharides , there is another class of hetero polysaccharide that forms an important constituent of the bacterial cell wall .
A chemical bond is an attraction between atoms and as a result of different behaviours of the outermost or the valence electrons of an atoms that merge into each other seamlessly in various circumstances so that there is no clear line to be drawn between them.
Overton concept of lipid structures of membrane - Charles Ernest Overton played an important role in the understanding of the picture of the cell membrane .
So, initially it was thought that is, it is only present in the you know experimental conditions like for example, you increase the salt or increase the humidity by using alcohol and so on.
Because of the fact like I mentioned , because of the fact that these G A Gs are charged , they make the proteoglycan or the aggrecan molecules highly polyanionic .
How the amino acid quantified ?
And , as we have already discussed before because the unsaturation , unsaturated fatty acids are very high in plant oils , it makes them liquid at room temperature while the animal fats have more of saturated fatty acids thereby making them solids at room temperature .
The quinolone drug inhibition depends on the magnesium ion concentration , which is required for the effective inhibition of topoisomerase .
The third part is a sedimentation rate is zero when the particle density is same as the medium density , of course , if the two things are equal then the density of the particle minus the density of the liquid medium equals to zero and everything something multiplied by zero becomes zero .
And, therefore the pH can be calculated as pKa that is the acid ionization, pK is the ionization, K is ionisation constant and pK plus log A minus by HA.
