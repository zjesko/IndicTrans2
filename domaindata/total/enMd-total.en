Adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) is a type of cancer in which the bone marrow makes too many lymphocytes ( a type of white blood cell )    .
Adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ; also called acute lymphocytic leukemia ) is a cancer of the blood and bone marrow    .
This type of cancer usually gets worse quickly if it is not treated    .
Leukemia may affect red blood cells , white blood cells , and platelets    .
Normally , the bone marrow makes blood stem cells ( immature cells ) that become mature blood cells over time    .
A blood stem cell may become a myeloid stem cell or a lymphoid stem cell    .
A myeloid stem cell becomes one of three types of mature blood cells : - Red blood cells that carry oxygen and other substances to all tissues of the body    .
- Platelets that form blood clots to stop bleeding    .
- Granulocytes ( white blood cells ) that fight infection and disease    .
A lymphoid stem cell becomes a lymphoblast cell and then one of three types of lymphocytes ( white blood cells ) : - B lymphocytes that make antibodies to help fight infection    .
- T lymphocytes that help B lymphocytes make the antibodies that help fight infection    .
- Natural killer cells that attack cancer cells and viruses    .
In ALL , too many stem cells become lymphoblasts , B lymphocytes , or T lymphocytes    .
These cells are also called leukemia cells    .
These leukemia cells are not able to fight infection very well    .
Also , as the number of leukemia cells increases in the blood and bone marrow , there is less room for healthy white blood cells , red blood cells , and platelets    .
This may cause infection , anemia , and easy bleeding    .
The cancer can also spread to the central nervous system ( brain and spinal cord )    .

What are the symptoms of Adult Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia ?
Signs and symptoms of adult ALL include fever , feeling tired , and easy bruising or bleeding    .
The early signs and symptoms of ALL may be like the flu or other common diseases    .
Check with your doctor if you have any of the following : - Weakness or feeling tired    .
- Fever or night sweats    .
- Easy bruising or bleeding    .
- Petechiae ( flat , pinpoint spots under the skin , caused by bleeding )    .
- Shortness of breath    .
- Weight loss or loss of appetite    .
- Pain in the bones or stomach    .
- Pain or feeling of fullness below the ribs    .
- Painless lumps in the neck , underarm , stomach , or groin    .
- Having many infections    .
These and other signs and symptoms may be caused by adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia or by other conditions    .
How to diagnose Adult Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia ?
Tests that examine the blood and bone marrow are used to detect ( find ) and diagnose adult ALL    .
The following tests and procedures may be used : - Physical exam and history :
An exam of the body to check general signs of health , including checking for signs of disease , such as infection or anything else that seems unusual    .
A history of the patient 's health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken    .
- Complete blood count ( CBC ) with differential :
A procedure in which a sample of blood is drawn and checked for the following : - The number of red blood cells and platelets    .
- The number and type of white blood cells    .
- The amount of hemoglobin ( the protein that carries oxygen ) in the red blood cells    .
- The portion of the blood sample made up of red blood cells    .
- Blood chemistry studies :
A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body    .
An unusual ( higher or lower than normal ) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease    .
- Peripheral blood smear :
A procedure in which a sample of blood is checked for blast cells , the number and kinds of white blood cells , the number of platelets , and changes in the shape of blood cells    .
- Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy :
The removal of bone marrow , blood , and a small piece of bone by inserting a hollow needle into the hipbone or breastbone    .
A pathologist views the bone marrow , blood , and bone under a microscope to look for abnormal cells    .
The following tests may be done on the samples of blood or bone marrow tissue that are removed : - Cytogenetic analysis :
A laboratory test in which the cells in a sample of blood or bone marrow are looked at under a microscope to find out if there are certain changes in the chromosomes of lymphocytes    .
For example , in Philadelphia chromosome positive ALL , part of one chromosome switches places with part of another chromosome    .
This is called the Philadelphia chromosome    .
- Immunophenotyping :
A process used to identify cells , based on the types of antigens or markers on the surface of the cell    .
This process is used to diagnose the subtype of ALL by comparing the cancer cells to normal cells of the immune system    .
For example , a cytochemistry study may test the cells in a sample of tissue using chemicals ( dyes ) to look for certain changes in the sample    .
A chemical may cause a color change in one type of leukemia cell but not in another type of leukemia cell    .
What is the outlook for Adult Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia ?
Certain factors affect prognosis ( chance of recovery ) and treatment options    .
The prognosis ( chance of recovery ) and treatment options depend on the following : - The age of the patient    .
- Whether the cancer has spread to the brain or spinal cord    .
- Whether there are certain changes in the genes , including the Philadelphia chromosome    .
- Whether the cancer has been treated before or has recurred ( come back )    .
Who is at risk for Adult Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia? ?
Previous chemotherapy and exposure to radiation may increase the risk of developing ALL    .
Anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor    .
Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer ; not having risk factors doesnt mean that you will not get cancer    .
Talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk    .
Possible risk factors for ALL include the following : - Being male    .
- Being white    .
- Being older than 70    .    - Past treatment with chemotherapy or radiation therapy    .
- Being exposed to high levels of radiation in the environment ( such as nuclear radiation )    .
- Having certain genetic disorders , such as Down syndrome    .
What are the stages of Adult Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia ?
Key Points
- Once adult ALL has been diagnosed , tests are done to find out if the cancer has spread to the central nervous system ( brain and spinal cord ) or to other parts of the body    .
- There is no standard staging system for adult ALL    .
Once adult ALL has been diagnosed , tests are done to find out if the cancer has spread to the central nervous system ( brain and spinal cord ) or to other parts of the body    .
The extent or spread of cancer is usually described as stages    .
It is important to know whether the leukemia has spread outside the blood and bone marrow in order to plan treatment    .
The following tests and procedures may be used to determine if the leukemia has spread : - Chest x-ray :
An x-ray of the organs and bones inside the chest    .
An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film , making a picture of areas inside the body    .
- Lumbar puncture : A procedure used to collect a sample of cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) from the spinal column    .
This is done by placing a needle between two bones in the spine and into the CSF around the spinal cord and removing a sample of the fluid    .
The sample of CSF is checked under a microscope for signs that leukemia cells have spread to the brain and spinal cord    .
This procedure is also called an LP or spinal tap    .
- CT scan ( CAT scan ) : A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of the abdomen , taken from different angles    .
The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine    .
A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly    .
This procedure is also called computed tomography , computerized tomography , or computerized axial tomography    .
- MRI ( magnetic resonance imaging ) : A procedure that uses a magnet , radio waves , and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body    .
This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging ( NMRI )    .
There is no standard staging system for adult ALL    .
The disease is described as untreated , in remission , or recurrent    .
Untreated adult ALL
The ALL is newly diagnosed and has not been treated except to relieve signs and symptoms such as fever , bleeding , or pain    .
- The complete blood count is abnormal    .
- More than 5 % of the cells in the bone marrow are blasts ( leukemia cells )    .
- There are signs and symptoms of leukemia    .
Adult ALL in remission
The ALL has been treated    .
- The complete blood count is normal    .
- 5 % or fewer of the cells in the bone marrow are blasts ( leukemia cells )    .
- There are no signs or symptoms of leukemia other than in the bone marrow    .
What are the treatments for Adult Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia ?
Key Points
- There are different types of treatment for patients with adult ALL    .
- The treatment of adult ALL usually has two phases    .
- Four types of standard treatment are used : - Chemotherapy - Radiation therapy - Chemotherapy with stem cell transplant - Targeted therapy - New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials    .
- Biologic therapy - Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
- Patients can enter clinical trials before , during , or after starting their cancer treatment    .
- Patients with ALL may have late effects after treatment    .
- Follow - up tests may be needed    .
There are different types of treatment for patients with adult ALL    .
Different types of treatment are available for patients with adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL )    .
Some treatments are standard ( the currently used treatment ) , and some are being tested in clinical trials    .
A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer    .
When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment , the new treatment may become the standard treatment    .
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment    .
The treatment of adult ALL usually has two phases    .
The treatment of adult ALL is done in phases : - Remission induction therapy :
This is the first phase of treatment    .
The goal is to kill the leukemia cells in the blood and bone marrow    .
This puts the leukemia into remission    .
- Post - remission therapy :
This is the second phase of treatment    .
It begins once the leukemia is in remission    .
The goal of post - remission therapy is to kill any remaining leukemia cells that may not be active but could begin to regrow and cause a relapse    .
This phase is also called remission continuation therapy    .
Treatment called central nervous system ( CNS ) sanctuary therapy is usually given during each phase of therapy    .
Because standard doses of chemotherapy may not reach leukemia cells in the CNS ( brain and spinal cord ) , the cells are able to &quot ; find sanctuary &quot ; ( hide ) in the CNS    .
Systemic chemotherapy given in high doses , intrathecal chemotherapy , and radiation therapy to the brain are able to reach leukemia cells in the CNS    .
They are given to kill the leukemia cells and lessen the chance the leukemia will recur ( come back )    .
CNS sanctuary therapy is also called CNS prophylaxis    .
Four types of standard treatment are used :
Chemotherapy Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells , either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing    .
When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle , the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body ( systemic chemotherapy )    .
When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid ( intrathecal chemotherapy ) , an organ , or a body cavity such as the abdomen , the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas ( regional chemotherapy )    .
Combination chemotherapy is treatment using more than one anticancer drug    .
The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated    .
Intrathecal chemotherapy may be used to treat adult ALL that has spread , or may spread , to the brain and spinal cord    .
When used to lessen the chance leukemia cells will spread to the brain and spinal cord , it is called central nervous system ( CNS ) sanctuary therapy or CNS prophylaxis    .
See Drugs Approved for Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia for more information    .
Radiation therapy Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high - energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing    .
There are two types of radiation therapy : - External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer    .
- Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles , seeds , wires , or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer    .
The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type of cancer    .
External radiation therapy may be used to treat adult ALL that has spread , or may spread , to the brain and spinal cord    .
When used this way , it is called central nervous system ( CNS ) sanctuary therapy or CNS prophylaxis    .
External radiation therapy may also be used as palliative therapy to relieve symptoms and improve quality of life    .
Chemotherapy with stem cell transplant
Stem cell transplant is a method of giving chemotherapy and replacing blood - forming cells destroyed by the cancer treatment    .
Stem cells ( immature blood cells ) are removed from the blood or bone marrow of the patient or a donor and are frozen and stored    .
After the chemotherapy is completed , the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion    .
These reinfused stem cells grow into ( and restore ) the body 's blood cells    .
See Drugs Approved for Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia for more information    .
Targeted therapy Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells    .
Targeted therapy drugs called tyrosine kinase inhibitors are used to treat some types of adult ALL    .
These drugs block the enzyme , tyrosine kinase , that causes stem cells to develop into more white blood cells ( blasts ) than the body needs    .
Three of the drugs used are imatinib mesylate ( Gleevec ) , dasatinib , and nilotinib    .
See Drugs Approved for Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia for more information    .
New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials    .
This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials    .
It may not mention every new treatment being studied    .
Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website    .
Biologic therapy Biologic therapy is a treatment that uses the patient 's immune system to fight cancer    .
Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost , direct , or restore the body 's natural defenses against cancer    .
This type of cancer treatment is also called biotherapy or immunotherapy    .
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
For some patients , taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice    .
Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process    .
Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment    .
Many of today 's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials    .
Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment    .
Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future    .
Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments , they often answer important questions and help move research forward    .
Patients can enter clinical trials before , during , or after starting their cancer treatment    .
Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment    .
Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better    .
There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring ( coming back ) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment    .
Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country    .
See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials    .
These have been retrieved from NCI 's listing of clinical trials    .
Patients with ALL may have late effects after treatment    .
Side effects from cancer treatment that begin during or after treatment and continue for months or years are called late effects    .
Late effects of treatment for ALL may include the risk of second cancers ( new types of cancer )    .
Regular follow - up exams are very important for long - term survivors    .
Follow - up tests may be needed    .
Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated    .
Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working    .
Decisions about whether to continue , change , or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests    .
Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended    .
The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred ( come back )    .
These tests are sometimes called follow - up tests or check - ups    .

What is (are) Adult Acute Myeloid Leukemia ?
Key Points
- Adult acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) is a type of cancer in which the bone marrow makes abnormal myeloblasts ( a type of white blood cell ) , red blood cells , or platelets    .
- Leukemia may affect red blood cells , white blood cells , and platelets    .
- There are different subtypes of AML    .
- Smoking , previous chemotherapy treatment , and exposure to radiation may affect the risk of adult AML    .
- Signs and symptoms of adult AML include fever , feeling tired , and easy bruising or bleeding    .
- Tests that examine the blood and bone marrow are used to detect ( find ) and diagnose adult AML    .
- Certain factors affect prognosis ( chance of recovery ) and treatment options    .
Adult acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) is a type of cancer in which the bone marrow makes abnormal myeloblasts ( a type of white blood cell ) , red blood cells , or platelets    .
Adult acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) is a cancer of the blood and bone marrow    .
This type of cancer usually gets worse quickly if it is not treated    .
It is the most common type of acute leukemia in adults    .
AML is also called acute myelogenous leukemia , acute myeloblastic leukemia , acute granulocytic leukemia , and acute nonlymphocytic leukemia    .
Leukemia may affect red blood cells , white blood cells , and platelets    .
Normally , the bone marrow makes blood stem cells ( immature cells ) that become mature blood cells over time    .
A blood stem cell may become a myeloid stem cell or a lymphoid stem cell    .
A lymphoid stem cell becomes a white blood cell    .
A myeloid stem cell becomes one of three types of mature blood cells : - Red blood cells that carry oxygen and other substances to all tissues of the body    .
- White blood cells that fight infection and disease    .
- Platelets that form blood clots to stop bleeding    .
In AML , the myeloid stem cells usually become a type of immature white blood cell called myeloblasts ( or myeloid blasts )    .
The myeloblasts in AML are abnormal and do not become healthy white blood cells    .
Sometimes in AML , too many stem cells become abnormal red blood cells or platelets    .
These abnormal white blood cells , red blood cells , or platelets are also called leukemia cells or blasts    .
Leukemia cells can build up in the bone marrow and blood so there is less room for healthy white blood cells , red blood cells , and platelets    .
When this happens , infection , anemia , or easy bleeding may occur    .
The leukemia cells can spread outside the blood to other parts of the body , including the central nervous system ( brain and spinal cord ) , skin , and gums    .
This summary is about adult AML    .
See the following PDQ summaries for information about other types of leukemia : - Childhood Acute Myeloid Leukemia / Other Myeloid Malignancies Treatment - Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia Treatment - Adult Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Treatment - Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Treatment - Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Treatment - Hairy Cell Leukemia Treatment
There are different subtypes of AML    .
Most AML subtypes are based on how mature ( developed ) the cancer cells are at the time of diagnosis and how different they are from normal cells    .
Acute promyelocytic leukemia ( APL ) is a subtype of AML that occurs when parts of two genes stick together    .
APL usually occurs in middle - aged adults    .
Signs of APL may include both bleeding and forming blood clots    .
Who is at risk for Adult Acute Myeloid Leukemia? ?
Smoking , previous chemotherapy treatment , and exposure to radiation may affect the risk of adult AML    .
Anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor    .
Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer ; not having risk factors doesnt mean that you will not get cancer    .
Talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk    .
Possible risk factors for AML include the following : - Being male    .
- Smoking , especially after age 60    .    - Having had treatment with chemotherapy or radiation therapy in the past    .
- Having had treatment for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) in the past    .
- Being exposed to radiation from an atomic bomb or to the chemical benzene    .
- Having a history of a blood disorder such as myelodysplastic syndrome    .
What are the symptoms of Adult Acute Myeloid Leukemia ?
The early signs and symptoms of AML may be like those caused by the flu or other common diseases    .
Check with your doctor if you have any of the following : - Fever    .    - Shortness of breath    .
- Easy bruising or bleeding    .
- Petechiae ( flat , pinpoint spots under the skin caused by bleeding )    .

When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment , the new treatment may become the standard treatment    .
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment    .
The treatment of adult AML usually has 2 phases    .
The 2 treatment phases of adult AML are : - Remission induction therapy :
This is the first phase of treatment    .
The goal is to kill the leukemia cells in the blood and bone marrow    .
This puts the leukemia into remission    .
- Post - remission therapy :
This is the second phase of treatment    .
It begins after the leukemia is in remission    .
The goal of post - remission therapy is to kill any remaining leukemia cells that may not be active but could begin to regrow and cause a relapse    .
This phase is also called remission continuation therapy    .
Four types of standard treatment are used :
Chemotherapy Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells , either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing    .
When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle , the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body ( systemic chemotherapy )    .
When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid ( intrathecal chemotherapy ) , an organ , or a body cavity such as the abdomen , the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas ( regional chemotherapy )    .
Intrathecal chemotherapy may be used to treat adult AML that has spread to the brain and spinal cord    .
Combination chemotherapy is treatment using more than one anticancer drug    .
The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the subtype of AML being treated and whether leukemia cells have spread to the brain and spinal cord    .
See Drugs Approved for Acute Myeloid Leukemia for more information    .
Radiation therapy Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high - energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing    .
There are two types of radiation therapy : - External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer    .
- Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles , seeds , wires , or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer    .
The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type of cancer being treated and whether leukemia cells have spread to the brain and spinal cord    .
External radiation therapy is used to treat adult AML    .
Stem cell transplant
Stem cell transplant is a method of giving chemotherapy and replacing blood - forming cells that are abnormal or destroyed by the cancer treatment    .
Stem cells ( immature blood cells ) are removed from the blood or bone marrow of the patient or a donor and are frozen and stored    .
After the chemotherapy is completed , the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion    .
These reinfused stem cells grow into ( and restore ) the body 's blood cells    .
Other drug therapy Arsenic trioxide and all - trans retinoic acid ( ATRA ) are anticancer drugs that kill leukemia cells , stop the leukemia cells from dividing , or help the leukemia cells mature into white blood cells    .
These drugs are used in the treatment of a subtype of AML called acute promyelocytic leukemia    .
See Drugs Approved for Acute Myeloid Leukemia for more information    .
New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials    .
This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials    .
It may not mention every new treatment being studied    .
Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website    .
Targeted therapy Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells    .
Monoclonal antibody therapy is one type of targeted therapy being studied in the treatment of adult AML    .
Monoclonal antibody therapy is a cancer treatment that uses antibodies made in the laboratory from a single type of immune system cell    .
These antibodies can identify substances on cancer cells or normal substances that may help cancer cells grow    .
The antibodies attach to the substances and kill the cancer cells , block their growth , or keep them from spreading    .
Monoclonal antibodies are given by infusion    .
They may be used alone or to carry drugs , toxins , or radioactive material directly to cancer cells    .
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
For some patients , taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice    .
Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process    .
Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment    .
Many of today 's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials    .
Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment    .
Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future    .
Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments , they often answer important questions and help move research forward    .
Patients can enter clinical trials before , during , or after starting their cancer treatment    .
Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment    .
Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better    .
There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring ( coming back ) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment    .
Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country    .
See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials    .
These have been retrieved from NCI 's listing of clinical trials    .
Follow - up tests may be needed    .
Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated    .
Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working    .
Decisions about whether to continue , change , or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests    .
Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended    .
The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred ( come back )    .
These tests are sometimes called follow - up tests or check - ups    .

What is (are) Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia ?
Key Points
- Chronic lymphocytic leukemia is a type of cancer in which the bone marrow makes too many lymphocytes ( a type of white blood cell )    .
- Leukemia may affect red blood cells , white blood cells , and platelets    .
- Older age can affect the risk of developing chronic lymphocytic leukemia    .
- Signs and symptoms of chronic lymphocytic leukemia include swollen lymph nodes and tiredness    .
- Tests that examine the blood , bone marrow , and lymph nodes are used to detect ( find ) and diagnose chronic lymphocytic leukemia    .
- Certain factors affect treatment options and prognosis ( chance of recovery )    .
Chronic lymphocytic leukemia is a type of cancer in which the bone marrow makes too many lymphocytes ( a type of white blood cell )    .
Chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( also called CLL ) is a blood and bone marrow disease that usually gets worse slowly    .
CLL is one of the most common types of leukemia in adults    .
It often occurs during or after middle age ; it rarely occurs in children    .
Leukemia may affect red blood cells , white blood cells , and platelets    .
Normally , the body makes blood stem cells ( immature cells ) that become mature blood cells over time    .
A blood stem cell may become a myeloid stem cell or a lymphoid stem cell    .
A myeloid stem cell becomes one of three types of mature blood cells : - Red blood cells that carry oxygen and other substances to all tissues of the body    .
- White blood cells that fight infection and disease    .
- Platelets that form blood clots to stop bleeding    .
A lymphoid stem cell becomes a lymphoblast cell and then one of three types of lymphocytes ( white blood cells ) : - B lymphocytes that make antibodies to help fight infection    .
- T lymphocytes that help B lymphocytes make antibodies to fight infection    .
- Natural killer cells that attack cancer cells and viruses    .
In CLL , too many blood stem cells become abnormal lymphocytes and do not become healthy white blood cells    .
The abnormal lymphocytes may also be called leukemia cells    .
The lymphocytes are not able to fight infection very well    .
Also , as the number of lymphocytes increases in the blood and bone marrow , there is less room for healthy white blood cells , red blood cells , and platelets    .
This may cause infection , anemia , and easy bleeding    .
This summary is about chronic lymphocytic leukemia    .
See the following PDQ summaries for more information about leukemia : - Adult Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Treatment    .
- Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Treatment    .
- Adult Acute Myeloid Leukemia Treatment    .
- Childhood Acute Myeloid Leukemia / Other Myeloid Malignancies Treatment    .    - Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia Treatment    .
- Hairy Cell Leukemia Treatment    .
Who is at risk for Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia? ?
Older age can affect the risk of developing chronic lymphocytic leukemia    .
Anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor    .
Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer ; not having risk factors doesnt mean that you will not get cancer    .
Talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk    .
Risk factors for CLL include the following : - Being middle - aged or older , male , or white    .    - A family history of CLL or cancer of the lymph system    .
- Having relatives who are Russian Jews or Eastern European Jews    .
What are the symptoms of Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia ?
Signs and symptoms of chronic lymphocytic leukemia include swollen lymph nodes and tiredness    .
Usually CLL does not cause any signs or symptoms and is found during a routine blood test    .
Signs and symptoms may be caused by CLL or by other conditions    .
Check with your doctor if you have any of the following : - Painless swelling of the lymph nodes in the neck , underarm , stomach , or groin    .
- Feeling very tired    .
- Pain or fullness below the ribs    .
- Fever and infection    .
- Weight loss for no known reason    .
How to diagnose Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia ?
Tests that examine the blood , bone marrow , and lymph nodes are used to detect ( find ) and diagnose chronic lymphocytic leukemia    .
The following tests and procedures may be used : - Physical exam and history :
An exam of the body to check general signs of health , including checking for signs of disease , such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual    .
A history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken    .
- Complete blood count ( CBC ) with differential :
- Immunophenotyping :
If the cells are malignant lymphocytes ( cancer ) , they are checked to see if they are B lymphocytes or T lymphocytes    .
- FISH ( fluorescence in situ hybridization ) : A laboratory technique used to look at genes or chromosomes in cells and tissues    .
Pieces of DNA that contain a fluorescent dye are made in the laboratory and added to cells or tissues on a glass slide    .
When these pieces of DNA bind to specific genes or areas of chromosomes on the slide , they light up when viewed under a microscope with a special light    .
- Flow cytometry :
The cells are stained with a light - sensitive dye , placed in a fluid , and passed in a stream before a laser or other type of light    .
The measurements are based on how the light - sensitive dye reacts to the light    .
- IgVH gene mutation test : A laboratory test done on a bone marrow or blood sample to check for an IgVH gene mutation    .
Patients with an IgVH gene mutation have a better prognosis    .
- Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy :
The removal of bone marrow , blood , and a small piece of bone by inserting a hollow needle into the hipbone or breastbone    .
A pathologist views the bone marrow , blood , and bone under a microscope to look for abnormal cells    .
What is the outlook for Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia ?
Certain factors affect treatment options and prognosis ( chance of recovery )    .
Treatment options depend on : - The stage of the disease    .
- Red blood cell , white blood cell , and platelet blood counts    .
- Whether there are signs or symptoms , such as fever , chills , or weight loss    .
- Whether the liver , spleen , or lymph nodes are larger than normal    .
- The response to initial treatment    .
- Whether the CLL has recurred ( come back )    .
The prognosis ( chance of recovery ) depends on : - Whether there is a change in the DNA and the type of change , if there is one    .
- Whether lymphocytes are spread throughout the bone marrow    .
- The stage of the disease    .
- Whether the CLL gets better with treatment or has recurred ( come back )    .
- Whether the CLL progresses to lymphoma or prolymphocytic leukemia    .    - The patient 's general health    .

Biologic therapy Biologic therapy is a treatment that uses the patient 's immune system to fight cancer    .
Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost , direct , or restore the body 's natural defenses against cancer    .
This type of cancer treatment is also called biotherapy or immunotherapy    .
Chimeric antigen receptor ( CAR ) T - cell therapy CAR T - cell therapy is a type of immunotherapy that changes the patient 's T cells ( a type of immune system cell ) so they will attack certain proteins on the surface of cancer cells    .
T cells are taken from the patient and special receptors are added to their surface in the laboratory    .
The changed cells are called chimeric antigen receptor ( CAR ) T cells    .
The CAR T cells are grown in the laboratory and given to the patient by infusion    .
The CAR T cells multiply in the patient 's blood and attack cancer cells    .
CAR T - cell therapy is being studied in the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia    .

What is (are) Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia ?
Key Points
- Chronic myelogenous leukemia is a disease in which the bone marrow makes too many white blood cells    .
- Leukemia may affect red blood cells , white blood cells , and platelets    .
- Signs and symptoms of chronic myelogenous leukemia include fever , night sweats , and tiredness    .
- Most people with CML have a gene mutation ( change ) called the Philadelphia chromosome    .
- Tests that examine the blood and bone marrow are used to detect ( find ) and diagnose chronic myelogenous leukemia    .
- Certain factors affect prognosis ( chance of recovery ) and treatment options    .
Chronic myelogenous leukemia is a disease in which the bone marrow makes too many white blood cells    .
Chronic myelogenous leukemia ( also called CML or chronic granulocytic leukemia ) is a slowly progressing blood and bone marrow disease that usually occurs during or after middle age , and rarely occurs in children    .
Leukemia may affect red blood cells , white blood cells , and platelets    .
Normally , the bone marrow makes blood stem cells ( immature cells ) that become mature blood cells over time    .
A blood stem cell may become a myeloid stem cell or a lymphoid stem cell    .
A lymphoid stem cell becomes a white blood cell    .
A myeloid stem cell becomes one of three types of mature blood cells : - Red blood cells that carry oxygen and other substances to all tissues of the body    .
- Platelets that form blood clots to stop bleeding    .
- Granulocytes ( white blood cells ) that fight infection and disease    .
In CML , too many blood stem cells become a type of white blood cell called granulocytes    .
These granulocytes are abnormal and do not become healthy white blood cells    .
They are also called leukemia cells    .
The leukemia cells can build up in the blood and bone marrow so there is less room for healthy white blood cells , red blood cells , and platelets    .
When this happens , infection , anemia , or easy bleeding may occur    .

What are the symptoms of Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia ?
Signs and symptoms of chronic myelogenous leukemia include fever , night sweats , and tiredness    .
These and other signs and symptoms may be caused by CML or by other conditions    .
Check with your doctor if you have any of the following : - Feeling very tired    .
- Weight loss for no known reason    .
- Night sweats    .
- Fever    .    - Pain or a feeling of fullness below the ribs on the left side    .
Sometimes CML does not cause any symptoms at all    .
What are the genetic changes related to Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia ?
Most people with CML have a gene mutation ( change ) called the Philadelphia chromosome    .
Every cell in the body contains DNA ( genetic material ) that determines how the cell looks and acts    .
DNA is contained inside chromosomes    .
In CML , part of the DNA from one chromosome moves to another chromosome    .
This change is called the Philadelphia chromosome    .
It results in the bone marrow making an enzyme , called tyrosine kinase , that causes too many stem cells to become white blood cells ( granulocytes or blasts )    .
The Philadelphia chromosome is not passed from parent to child    .
How to diagnose Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia ?
Tests that examine the blood and bone marrow are used to detect ( find ) and diagnose chronic myelogenous leukemia    .      .
The following tests and procedures may be used : - Physical exam and history :
An exam of the body to check general signs of health , including checking for signs of disease such as an enlarged spleen    .
A history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken    .
- Complete blood count ( CBC ) with differential :
A procedure in which a sample of blood is drawn and checked for the following : - The number of red blood cells and platelets    .
- The number and type of white blood cells    .
- The amount of hemoglobin ( the protein that carries oxygen ) in the red blood cells    .
- The portion of the blood sample made up of red blood cells    .
- Blood chemistry studies :
A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body    .
An unusual ( higher or lower than normal ) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease    .
- Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy :
The removal of bone marrow , blood , and a small piece of bone by inserting a needle into the hipbone or breastbone    .
A pathologist views the bone marrow , blood , and bone under a microscope to look for abnormal cells    .
One of the following tests may be done on the samples of blood or bone marrow tissue that are removed : - Cytogenetic analysis :
A test in which cells in a sample of blood or bone marrow are viewed under a microscope to look for certain changes in the chromosomes , such as the Philadelphia chromosome    .
- FISH ( fluorescence in situ hybridization ) : A laboratory technique used to look at genes or chromosomes in cells and tissues    .
Pieces of DNA that contain a fluorescent dye are made in the laboratory and added to cells or tissues on a glass slide    .
When these pieces of DNA bind to specific genes or areas of chromosomes on the slide , they light up when viewed under a microscope with a special light    .
- Reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction ( RTPCR ) : A laboratory test in which cells in a sample of tissue are studied using chemicals to look for certain changes in the structure or function of genes    .
What is the outlook for Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia ?
Certain factors affect prognosis ( chance of recovery ) and treatment options    .
The prognosis ( chance of recovery ) and treatment options depend on the following : - The patients age    .
- The phase of CML    .    - The amount of blasts in the blood or bone marrow    .
- The size of the spleen at diagnosis    .
- The patients general health    .
What are the stages of Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia ?
Key Points
- After chronic myelogenous leukemia has been diagnosed , tests are done to find out if the cancer has spread    .
- Chronic myelogenous leukemia has 3 phases    .
- Chronic phase - Accelerated phase - Blastic phase
After chronic myelogenous leukemia has been diagnosed , tests are done to find out if the cancer has spread    .
Staging is the process used to find out how far the cancer has spread    .
There is no standard staging system for chronic myelogenous leukemia ( CML )    .
Instead , the disease is classified by phase : chronic phase , accelerated phase , or blastic phase    .
It is important to know the phase in order to plan treatment    .
The information from tests and procedures done to detect ( find ) and diagnose chronic myelogenous leukemia is also used to plan treatment    .
Chronic myelogenous leukemia has 3 phases    .
As the amount of blast cells increases in the blood and bone marrow , there is less room for healthy white blood cells , red blood cells , and platelets    .
This may result in infections , anemia , and easy bleeding , as well as bone pain and pain or a feeling of fullness below the ribs on the left side    .
The number of blast cells in the blood and bone marrow and the severity of signs or symptoms determine the phase of the disease    .
Chronic phase
In chronic phase CML , fewer than 10 % of the cells in the blood and bone marrow are blast cells    .
Accelerated phase
In accelerated phase CML , 10 % to 19 % of the cells in the blood and bone marrow are blast cells    .
Blastic phase
In blastic phase CML , 20 % or more of the cells in the blood or bone marrow are blast cells    .
When tiredness , fever , and an enlarged spleen occur during the blastic phase , it is called blast crisis    .
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia ?
New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials    .
Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website    .
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
For some patients , taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice    .
Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process    .
Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment    .
Many of today 's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials    .
Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment    .
Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future    .
Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments , they often answer important questions and help move research forward    .
Patients can enter clinical trials before , during , or after starting their cancer treatment    .
Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment    .
Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better    .
There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring ( coming back ) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment    .
Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country    .
See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials    .

What are the treatments for Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia ?
Key Points
- There are different types of treatment for patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia    .
- Six types of standard treatment are used : - Targeted therapy - Chemotherapy - Biologic therapy - High - dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant - Donor lymphocyte infusion ( DLI ) - Surgery - New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials    .
- Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
- Patients can enter clinical trials before , during , or after starting their cancer treatment    .
- Follow - up tests may be needed    .
There are different types of treatment for patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia    .
Different types of treatment are available for patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia ( CML )    .
Some treatments are standard ( the currently used treatment ) , and some are being tested in clinical trials    .
A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information about new treatments for patients with cancer    .
When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment , the new treatment may become the standard treatment    .
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment    .
Six types of standard treatment are used :
Targeted therapy Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells    .
Tyrosine kinase inhibitors are targeted therapy drugs used to treat chronic myelogenous leukemia    .
Imatinib mesylate , nilotinib , dasatinib , and ponatinib are tyrosine kinase inhibitors that are used to treat CML    .
See Drugs Approved for Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia for more information    .
Chemotherapy Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells , either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing    .
When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle , the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body ( systemic chemotherapy )    .
When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid , an organ , or a body cavity such as the abdomen , the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas ( regional chemotherapy )    .
The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated    .
See Drugs Approved for Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia for more information    .
Biologic therapy Biologic therapy is a treatment that uses the patients immune system to fight cancer    .
Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost , direct , or restore the bodys natural defenses against cancer    .
This type of cancer treatment is also called biotherapy or immunotherapy    .
See Drugs Approved for Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia for more information    .
High - dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant High - dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant is a method of giving high doses of chemotherapy and replacing blood - forming cells destroyed by the cancer treatment    .
Stem cells ( immature blood cells ) are removed from the blood or bone marrow of the patient or a donor and are frozen and stored    .
After the chemotherapy is completed , the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion    .
These reinfused stem cells grow into ( and restore ) the bodys blood cells    .
See Drugs Approved for Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia for more information    .
Donor lymphocyte infusion ( DLI ) Donor lymphocyte infusion ( DLI ) is a cancer treatment that may be used after stem cell transplant    .
Lymphocytes ( a type of white blood cell ) from the stem cell transplant donor are removed from the donors blood and may be frozen for storage    .
The donors lymphocytes are thawed if they were frozen and then given to the patient through one or more infusions    .
The lymphocytes see the patients cancer cells as not belonging to the body and attack them    .
Surgery Splenectomy is surgery to remove the spleen    .
New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials    .
Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website    .

See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials    .
These have been retrieved from NCI 's listing of clinical trials    .
Follow - up tests may be needed    .
Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated    .
Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working    .
Decisions about whether to continue , change , or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests    .
Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended    .
The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred ( come back )    .
These tests are sometimes called follow - up tests or check - ups    .

What is (are) Hairy Cell Leukemia ?
Key Points
- Hairy cell leukemia is a type of cancer in which the bone marrow makes too many lymphocytes ( a type of white blood cell )    .
- Leukemia may affect red blood cells , white blood cells , and platelets    .
- Gender and age may affect the risk of hairy cell leukemia    .
- Signs and symptoms of hairy cell leukemia include infections , tiredness , and pain below the ribs    .
- Tests that examine the blood and bone marrow are used to detect ( find ) and diagnose hairy cell leukemia    .
- Certain factors affect treatment options and prognosis ( chance of recovery )    .
Hairy cell leukemia is a type of cancer in which the bone marrow makes too many lymphocytes ( a type of white blood cell )    .
Hairy cell leukemia is a cancer of the blood and bone marrow    .
This rare type of leukemia gets worse slowly or does not get worse at all    .
The disease is called hairy cell leukemia because the leukemia cells look &quot ; hairy&quot ; when viewed under a microscope    .
Leukemia may affect red blood cells , white blood cells , and platelets    .
Normally , the bone marrow makes blood stem cells ( immature cells ) that become mature blood cells over time    .
A blood stem cell may become a myeloid stem cell or a lymphoid stem cell    .
A myeloid stem cell becomes one of three types of mature blood cells : - Red blood cells that carry oxygen and other substances to all tissues of the body    .
- White blood cells that fight infection and disease    .
- Platelets that form blood clots to stop bleeding    .
A lymphoid stem cell becomes a lymphoblast cell and then into one of three types of lymphocytes ( white blood cells ) : - B lymphocytes that make antibodies to help fight infection    .
- T lymphocytes that help B lymphocytes make antibodies to help fight infection    .
- Natural killer cells that attack cancer cells and viruses    .
In hairy cell leukemia , too many blood stem cells become lymphocytes    .
These lymphocytes are abnormal and do not become healthy white blood cells    .
They are also called leukemia cells    .
The leukemia cells can build up in the blood and bone marrow so there is less room for healthy white blood cells , red blood cells , and platelets    .
This may cause infection , anemia , and easy bleeding    .
Some of the leukemia cells may collect in the spleen and cause it to swell    .
This summary is about hairy cell leukemia    .
See the following PDQ summaries for information about other types of leukemia : - Adult Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Treatment    .
- Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Treatment    .
- Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Treatment    .
- Adult Acute Myeloid Leukemia Treatment    .
- Childhood Acute Myeloid Leukemia / Other Myeloid Malignancies Treatment    .    - Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia Treatment    .
Who is at risk for Hairy Cell Leukemia? ?
Gender and age may affect the risk of hairy cell leukemia    .
Anything that increases your chance of getting a disease is called a risk factor    .
Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer ; not having risk factors doesnt mean that you will not get cancer    .
Talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk    .
The cause of hairy cell leukemia is unknown    .
It occurs more often in older men    .
What are the symptoms of Hairy Cell Leukemia ?
Signs and symptoms of hairy cell leukemia include infections , tiredness , and pain below the ribs    .
These and other signs and symptoms may be caused by hairy cell leukemia or by other conditions    .
Check with your doctor if you have any of the following : - Weakness or feeling tired    .
- Fever or frequent infections    .
- Easy bruising or bleeding    .
- Shortness of breath    .
- Weight loss for no known reason    .
- Pain or a feeling of fullness below the ribs    .
- Painless lumps in the neck , underarm , stomach , or groin    .
How to diagnose Hairy Cell Leukemia ?
Tests that examine the blood and bone marrow are used to detect ( find ) and diagnose hairy cell leukemia    .
The following tests and procedures may be used : - Physical exam and history :
An exam of the body to check general signs of health , including checking for signs of disease , such as a swollen spleen , lumps , or anything else that seems unusual    .
A history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken    .
- Complete blood count ( CBC ) : A procedure in which a sample of blood is drawn and checked for the following : - The number of red blood cells , white blood cells , and platelets    .
- The amount of hemoglobin ( the protein that carries oxygen ) in the red blood cells    .
- The portion of the sample made up of red blood cells    .
- Peripheral blood smear :
A procedure in which a sample of blood is checked for cells that look &quot ; hairy , &quot ; the number and kinds of white blood cells , the number of platelets , and changes in the shape of blood cells    .
- Blood chemistry studies :
A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body    .
An unusual ( higher or lower than normal ) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease    .
- Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy :
The removal of bone marrow , blood , and a small piece of bone by inserting a hollow needle into the hipbone or breastbone    .
A pathologist views the bone marrow , blood , and bone under a microscope to look for signs of cancer    .
- Immunophenotyping :
A laboratory test in which the antigens or markers on the surface of a blood or bone marrow cell are checked to see what type of cell it is    .
This test is done to diagnose the specific type of leukemia by comparing the cancer cells to normal cells of the immune system    .
- Flow cytometry :
A laboratory test that measures the number of cells in a sample , the percentage of live cells in a sample , and certain characteristics of cells , such as size , shape , and the presence of tumor markers on the cell surface    .
The cells are stained with a light - sensitive dye , placed in a fluid , and passed in a stream before a laser or other type of light    .
The measurements are based on how the light - sensitive dye reacts to the light    .
- Cytogenetic analysis :
A laboratory test in which cells in a sample of tissue are viewed under a microscope to look for certain changes in the chromosomes    .
- Gene mutation test : A laboratory test done on a bone marrow or blood sample to check for mutations in the BRAF gene    .
A BRAF gene mutation is often found in patients with hairy cell leukemia    .
- CT scan ( CAT scan ) : A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body , taken from different angles    .
The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine    .
A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly    .
This procedure is also called computed tomography , computerized tomography , or computerized axial tomography    .
A CT scan of the abdomen may be done to check for swollen lymph nodes or a swollen spleen    .
What is the outlook for Hairy Cell Leukemia ?
Certain factors affect treatment options and prognosis ( chance of recovery )    .
The treatment options may depend on the following : - The number of hairy ( leukemia ) cells and healthy blood cells in the blood and bone marrow    .
- Whether the spleen is swollen    .
- Whether there are signs or symptoms of leukemia , such as infection    .
- Whether the leukemia has recurred ( come back ) after previous treatment    .
The prognosis ( chance of recovery ) depends on the following : - Whether the hairy cell leukemia does not grow or grows so slowly it does not need treatment    .
- Whether the hairy cell leukemia responds to treatment    .
Treatment often results in a long - lasting remission ( a period during which some or all of the signs and symptoms of the leukemia are gone )    .
If the leukemia returns after it has been in remission , retreatment often causes another remission    .
What are the stages of Hairy Cell Leukemia ?
Key Points
- There is no standard staging system for hairy cell leukemia    .
There is no standard staging system for hairy cell leukemia    .
Staging is the process used to find out how far the cancer has spread    .
Groups are used in place of stages for hairy cell leukemia    .
The disease is grouped as untreated , progressive , or refractory    .
Untreated hairy cell leukemia
The hairy cell leukemia is newly diagnosed and has not been treated except to relieve signs or symptoms such as weight loss and infections    .
In untreated hairy cell leukemia , some or all of the following conditions occur : - Hairy ( leukemia ) cells are found in the blood and bone marrow    .
- The number of red blood cells , white blood cells , or platelets may be lower than normal    .
- The spleen may be larger than normal    .

There are different types of treatment for patients with hairy cell leukemia    .
Different types of treatment are available for patients with hairy cell leukemia    .
Some treatments are standard ( the currently used treatment ) , and some are being tested in clinical trials    .
A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer    .
When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment , the new treatment may become the standard treatment    .
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment    .
Five types of standard treatment are used :
Watchful waiting Watchful waiting is closely monitoring a patient 's condition , without giving any treatment until signs or symptoms appear or change    .
Chemotherapy Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells , either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing    .
When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle , the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body ( systemic chemotherapy )    .
When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid , an organ , or a body cavity such as the abdomen , the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas ( regional chemotherapy )    .
The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated    .
Cladribine and pentostatin are anticancer drugs commonly used to treat hairy cell leukemia    .
These drugs may increase the risk of other types of cancer , especially Hodgkin lymphoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma    .
Long - term follow up for second cancers is very important    .
Biologic therapy Biologic therapy is a cancer treatment that uses the patients immune system to fight cancer    .
Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost , direct , or restore the bodys natural defenses against cancer    .
This type of cancer treatment is also called biotherapy or immunotherapy    .
Interferon alfa is a biologic agent commonly used to treat hairy cell leukemia    .
See Drugs Approved for Hairy Cell Leukemia for more information    .
Surgery Splenectomy is a surgical procedure to remove the spleen    .
Targeted therapy Targeted therapy is a treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells    .
Monoclonal antibody therapy is a type of targeted therapy used to treat hairy cell leukemia    .
Monoclonal antibody therapy uses antibodies made in the laboratory from a single type of immune system cell    .
These antibodies can identify substances on cancer cells or normal substances that may help cancer cells grow    .
The antibodies attach to the substances and kill the cancer cells , block their growth , or keep them from spreading    .
Monoclonal antibodies are given by infusion    .
They may be used alone or to carry drugs , toxins , or radioactive material directly to cancer cells    .
A monoclonal antibody called rituximab may be used for certain patients with hairy cell leukemia    .
Other types of targeted therapies are being studied    .
New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials    .

Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working    .
Decisions about whether to continue , change , or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests    .
Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended    .
The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred ( come back )    .
These tests are sometimes called follow - up tests or check - ups    .

What is (are) Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia ?
Key Points
- Childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) is a type of cancer in which the bone marrow makes too many immature lymphocytes ( a type of white blood cell )    .
- Leukemia may affect red blood cells , white blood cells , and platelets    .
- Past treatment for cancer and certain genetic conditions affect the risk of having childhood ALL    .
- Signs of childhood ALL include fever and bruising    .
- Tests that examine the blood and bone marrow are used to detect ( find ) and diagnose childhood ALL    .
- Certain factors affect prognosis ( chance of recovery ) and treatment options    .
Childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) is a type of cancer in which the bone marrow makes too many immature lymphocytes ( a type of white blood cell )    .
Childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( also called ALL or acute lymphocytic leukemia ) is a cancer of the blood and bone marrow    .
This type of cancer usually gets worse quickly if it is not treated    .
ALL is the most common type of cancer in children    .
Leukemia may affect red blood cells , white blood cells , and platelets    .
In a healthy child , the bone marrow makes blood stem cells ( immature cells ) that become mature blood cells over time    .
A blood stem cell may become a myeloid stem cell or a lymphoid stem cell    .
A myeloid stem cell becomes one of three types of mature blood cells : - Red blood cells that carry oxygen and other substances to all tissues of the body    .
- Platelets that form blood clots to stop bleeding    .
- White blood cells that fight infection and disease    .
A lymphoid stem cell becomes a lymphoblast cell and then one of three types of lymphocytes ( white blood cells ) : - B lymphocytes that make antibodies to help fight infection    .
- T lymphocytes that help B lymphocytes make the antibodies that help fight infection    .
- Natural killer cells that attack cancer cells and viruses    .
In a child with ALL , too many stem cells become lymphoblasts , B lymphocytes , or T lymphocytes    .
The cells do not work like normal lymphocytes and are not able to fight infection very well    .
These cells are cancer ( leukemia ) cells    .
Also , as the number of leukemia cells increases in the blood and bone marrow , there is less room for healthy white blood cells , red blood cells , and platelets    .
This may lead to infection , anemia , and easy bleeding    .
This summary is about acute lymphoblastic leukemia in children , adolescents , and young adults    .
See the following PDQ summaries for information about other types of leukemia : - Childhood Acute Myeloid Leukemia / Other Myeloid Malignancies Treatment - Adult Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Treatment - Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Treatment - Adult Acute Myeloid Leukemia Treatment - Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia Treatment - Hairy Cell Leukemia Treatment
What are the symptoms of Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia ?
Signs of childhood ALL include fever and bruising    .
These and other signs and symptoms may be caused by childhood ALL or by other conditions    .
Check with your child 's doctor if your child has any of the following : - Fever    .    - Easy bruising or bleeding    .
- Petechiae ( flat , pinpoint , dark - red spots under the skin caused by bleeding )    .
- Bone or joint pain    .
- Painless lumps in the neck , underarm , stomach , or groin    .
- Pain or feeling of fullness below the ribs    .
- Weakness , feeling tired , or looking pale    .
- Loss of appetite    .
How to diagnose Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia ?
Tests that examine the blood and bone marrow are used to detect ( find ) and diagnose childhood ALL    .
The following tests and procedures may be used to diagnose childhood ALL and find out if leukemia cells have spread to other parts of the body such as the brain or testicles : - Physical exam and history :
An exam of the body to check general signs of health , including checking for signs of disease , such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual    .
A history of the patient 's health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken    .
- Complete blood count ( CBC ) with differential :
A procedure in which a sample of blood is drawn and checked for the following : - The number of red blood cells and platelets    .
- The number and type of white blood cells    .
- The amount of hemoglobin ( the protein that carries oxygen ) in the red blood cells    .
- The portion of the sample made up of red blood cells    .
- Blood chemistry studies :
A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body    .
An unusual ( higher or lower than normal ) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease    .
- Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy :
The removal of bone marrow and a small piece of bone by inserting a hollow needle into the hipbone or breastbone    .
A pathologist views the bone marrow and bone under a microscope to look for signs of cancer    .
The following tests are done on blood or the bone marrow tissue that is removed : - Cytogenetic analysis :
A laboratory test in which the cells in a sample of blood or bone marrow are viewed under a microscope to look for certain changes in the chromosomes of lymphocytes    .
For example , in Philadelphia chromosome positive ALL , part of one chromosome switches places with part of another chromosome    .
This is called the Philadelphia chromosome    .
- Immunophenotyping :
A laboratory test in which the antigens or markers on the surface of a blood or bone marrow cell are checked to see if they are lymphocytes or myeloid cells    .
If the cells are malignant lymphocytes ( cancer ) they are checked to see if they are B lymphocytes or T lymphocytes    .
- Lumbar puncture : A procedure used to collect a sample of cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) from the spinal column    .
This is done by placing a needle between two bones in the spine and into the CSF around the spinal cord and removing a sample of the fluid    .
The sample of CSF is checked under a microscope for signs that leukemia cells have spread to the brain and spinal cord    .
This procedure is also called an LP or spinal tap    .
This procedure is done after leukemia is diagnosed to find out if leukemia cells have spread to the brain and spinal cord    .
Intrathecal chemotherapy is given after the sample of fluid is removed to treat any leukemia cells that may have spread to the brain and spinal cord    .
- Chest x-ray :
An x-ray of the organs and bones inside the chest    .
An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film , making a picture of areas inside the body    .
The chest x-ray is done to see if leukemia cells have formed a mass in the middle of the chest    .
What is the outlook for Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia ?
Certain factors affect prognosis ( chance of recovery ) and treatment options    .
The prognosis ( chance of recovery ) depends on : - How quickly and how low the leukemia cell count drops after the first month of treatment    .
- Age at the time of diagnosis , gender , race , and ethnic background    .
- The number of white blood cells in the blood at the time of diagnosis    .
- Whether the leukemia cells began from B lymphocytes or T lymphocytes    .
- Whether there are certain changes in the chromosomes or genes of the lymphocytes with cancer    .
- Whether the child has Down syndrome    .
- Whether leukemia cells are found in the cerebrospinal fluid    .
- The child 's weight at the time of diagnosis and during treatment    .
Treatment options depend on : - Whether the leukemia cells began from B lymphocytes or T lymphocytes    .
- Whether the child has standard - risk , high - risk , or very highrisk ALL    .    - The age of the child at the time of diagnosis    .
- Whether there are certain changes in the chromosomes of lymphocytes , such as the Philadelphia chromosome    .
- Whether the child was treated with steroids before the start of induction therapy    .
- How quickly and how low the leukemia cell count drops during treatment    .
For leukemia that relapses ( comes back ) after treatment , the prognosis and treatment options depend partly on the following : - How long it is between the time of diagnosis and when the leukemia comes back    .
- Whether the leukemia comes back in the bone marrow or in other parts of the body    .
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia ?
New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials    .
This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials    .
It may not mention every new treatment being studied    .
Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website    .
Chimeric antigen receptor ( CAR ) T - cell therapy CAR T - cell therapy is a type of immunotherapy that changes the patient 's T cells ( a type of immune system cell ) so they will attack certain proteins on the surface of cancer cells    .
T cells are taken from the patient and special receptors are added to their surface in the laboratory    .
The changed cells are called chimeric antigen receptor ( CAR ) T cells    .
The CAR T cells are grown in the laboratory and given to the patient by infusion    .
The CAR T cells multiply in the patient 's blood and attack cancer cells    .
CAR T - cell therapy is being studied in the treatment of childhood ALL that has relapsed ( come back ) a second time    .
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
For some patients , taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice    .
Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process    .
Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment    .
Many of today 's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials    .
Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment    .
Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future    .
Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments , they often answer important questions and help move research forward    .
Patients can enter clinical trials before , during , or after starting their cancer treatment    .
Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment    .
Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better    .
There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring ( coming back ) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment    .
Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country    .
See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials    .
These have been retrieved from NCI 's listing of clinical trials    .
Who is at risk for Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia? ?
Key Points
Past treatment for cancer and certain genetic conditions affect the risk of having childhood ALL    .
Anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor    .
Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer ; not having risk factors doesnt mean that you will not get cancer    .
Talk with your child 's doctor if you think your child may be at risk    .
Possible risk factors for ALL include the following : - Being exposed to x-rays before birth    .
- Being exposed to radiation    .
- Past treatment with chemotherapy    .
- Having certain genetic conditions , such as : - Down syndrome    .
- Neurofibromatosis type 1    .    - Bloom syndrome    .
- Fanconi anemia    .    - Ataxia - telangiectasia    .
- Li-Fraumeni syndrome    .
- Constitutional mismatch repair deficiency ( mutations in certain genes that stop DNA from repairing itself , which leads to the growth of cancers at an early age )    .
- Having certain changes in the chromosomes or genes    .
Risk Groups
- In childhood ALL , risk groups are used to plan treatment    .
- Relapsed childhood ALL is cancer that has come back after it has been treated    .
In childhood ALL , risk groups are used to plan treatment    .
There are three risk groups in childhood ALL    .
They are described as : - Standard ( low ) risk : Includes children aged 1 to younger than 10 years who have a white blood cell count of less than 50,000 / L at the time of diagnosis    .
- High risk : Includes children 10 years and older and / or children who have a white blood cell count of 50,000 / L or more at the time of diagnosis    .
- Very high risk :
Includes children younger than age 1 , children with certain changes in the genes , children who have a slow response to initial treatment , and children who have signs of leukemia after the first 4 weeks of treatment    .
Other factors that affect the risk group include the following : - Whether the leukemia cells began from B lymphocytes or T lymphocytes    .
- Whether there are certain changes in the chromosomes or genes of the lymphocytes    .
- How quickly and how low the leukemia cell count drops after initial treatment    .
- Whether leukemia cells are found in the cerebrospinal fluid at the time of diagnosis    .
It is important to know the risk group in order to plan treatment    .
Children with high - risk or very highrisk ALL usually receive more anticancer drugs and / or higher doses of anticancer drugs than children with standard - risk ALL    .
Relapsed childhood ALL is cancer that has come back after it has been treated    .
The leukemia may come back in the blood and bone marrow , brain , spinal cord , testicles , or other parts of the body    .
Refractory childhood ALL is cancer that does not respond to treatment    .
What are the treatments for Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia ?
Key Points
- There are different types of treatment for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL )    .
- Children with ALL should have their treatment planned by a team of doctors who are experts in treating childhood leukemia    .
- Children and adolescents may have treatment - related side effects that appear months or years after treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia    .
- The treatment of childhood ALL usually has three phases    .
- Four types of standard treatment are used : - Chemotherapy - Radiation therapy - Chemotherapy with stem cell transplant - Targeted therapy - Treatment is given to kill leukemia cells that have spread or may spread to the brain , spinal cord , or testicles    .
- New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials    .
- Chimeric antigen receptor ( CAR ) T - cell therapy - Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
- Patients can enter clinical trials before , during , or after starting their cancer treatment    .
- Follow - up tests may be needed    .
There are different types of treatment for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL )    .
Different types of treatment are available for children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL )    .
Some treatments are standard ( the currently used treatment ) , and some are being tested in clinical trials    .
A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer    .
When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment , the new treatment may become the standard treatment    .
Because cancer in children is rare , taking part in a clinical trial should be considered    .
Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment    .
Children with ALL should have their treatment planned by a team of doctors who are experts in treating childhood leukemia    .
Treatment will be overseen by a pediatric oncologist , a doctor who specializes in treating children with cancer    .
The pediatric oncologist works with other pediatric health professionals who are experts in treating children with leukemia and who specialize in certain areas of medicine    .
These may include the following specialists : - Pediatrician    .    - Hematologist    .    - Medical oncologist    .
- Pediatric surgeon    .
- Radiation oncologist    .    - Neurologist    .    - Pathologist    .    - Radiologist    .
- Pediatric nurse specialist    .
- Social worker    .
- Rehabilitation specialist    .
- Psychologist    .
- Child - life specialist    .
Children and adolescents may have treatment - related side effects that appear months or years after treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia    .
Regular follow - up exams are very important    .
Treatment can cause side effects long after it has ended    .
These are called late effects    .
Late effects of cancer treatment may include : - Physical problems , including problems with the heart , blood vessels , liver , or bones , and fertility    .
When dexrazoxane is given with chemotherapy drugs called anthracyclines , the risk of late heart effects is lessened    .
- Changes in mood , feelings , thinking , learning , or memory    .
Children younger than 4 years who have received radiation therapy to the brain have a higher risk of these effects    .
- Second cancers ( new types of cancer ) or other conditions , such as brain tumors , thyroid cancer , acute myeloid leukemia , and myelodysplastic syndrome    .
Some late effects may be treated or controlled    .
It is important to talk with your child 's doctors about the possible late effects caused by some treatments    .
See the PDQ summary on Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer    .
The treatment of childhood ALL usually has three phases    .
The treatment of childhood ALL is done in phases : - Remission induction :
This is the first phase of treatment    .
The goal is to kill the leukemia cells in the blood and bone marrow    .
This puts the leukemia into remission    .
- Consolidation / intensification :
This is the second phase of treatment    .
It begins once the leukemia is in remission    .
The goal of consolidation / intensification therapy is to kill any leukemia cells that remain in the body and may cause a relapse    .
- Maintenance :
This is the third phase of treatment    .
The goal is to kill any remaining leukemia cells that may regrow and cause a relapse    .
Often the cancer treatments are given in lower doses than those used during the remission induction and consolidation / intensification phases    .
Not taking medication as ordered by the doctor during maintenance therapy increases the chance the cancer will come back    .
This is also called the continuation therapy phase    .
Four types of standard treatment are used :
Chemotherapy Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells , either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing    .
When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle , the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body ( systemic chemotherapy )    .
When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid ( intrathecal ) , an organ , or a body cavity such as the abdomen , the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas ( regional chemotherapy )    .
Combination chemotherapy is treatment using more than one anticancer drug    .
The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the child 's risk group    .
Children with high - risk ALL receive more anticancer drugs and higher doses of anticancer drugs than children with standard - risk ALL    .
Intrathecal chemotherapy may be used to treat childhood ALL that has spread , or may spread , to the brain and spinal cord    .
See Drugs Approved for Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia for more information    .
Radiation therapy Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high - energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing    .
- Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles , seeds , wires , or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer    .
The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type of cancer being treated    .
External radiation therapy may be used to treat childhood ALL that has spread , or may spread , to the brain , spinal cord , or testicles    .
It may also be used to prepare the bone marrow for a stem cell transplant    .
Chemotherapy with stem cell transplant
Stem cell transplant is a method of giving high doses of chemotherapy and sometimes total - body irradiation , and then replacing the blood - forming cells destroyed by the cancer treatment    .
Stem cells ( immature blood cells ) are removed from the blood or bone marrow of a donor    .
After the patient receives treatment , the donor 's stem cells are given to the patient through an infusion    .
These reinfused stem cells grow into ( and restore ) the patient 's blood cells    .
The stem cell donor does n't have to be related to the patient    .
Stem cell transplant is rarely used as initial treatment for children and adolescents with ALL    .
It is used more often as part of treatment for ALL that relapses ( comes back after treatment )    .
See Drugs Approved for Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia for more information    .
Targeted therapy Targeted therapy is a treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells    .
Tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( TKIs ) are targeted therapy drugs that block the enzyme , tyrosine kinase , which causes stem cells to become more white blood cells or blasts than the body needs    .
Imatinib mesylate is a TKI used in the treatment of children with Philadelphia chromosome positive ALL    .
Dasatinib and ruxolitinib are TKIs that are being studied in the treatment of newly diagnosed high - risk ALL    .
Monoclonal antibody therapy is a cancer treatment that uses antibodies made in the laboratory , from a single type of immune system cell    .
These antibodies can identify substances on cancer cells or normal substances that may help cancer cells grow    .
The antibodies attach to the substances and kill the cancer cells , block their growth , or keep them from spreading    .
Monoclonal antibodies are given by infusion    .
They may be used alone or to carry drugs , toxins , or radioactive material directly to cancer cells    .
Blinatumomab and inotuzumab are monoclonal antibodies being studied in the treatment of refractory childhood ALL    .
New kinds of targeted therapies are also being studied in the treatment of childhood ALL    .
See Drugs Approved for Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia for more information    .
Treatment is given to kill leukemia cells that have spread or may spread to the brain , spinal cord , or testicles    .
Treatment to kill leukemia cells or prevent the spread of leukemia cells to the brain and spinal cord ( central nervous system ; CNS ) is called CNS - directed therapy    .
Chemotherapy may be used to treat leukemia cells that have spread , or may spread , to the brain and spinal cord    .
Because standard doses of chemotherapy may not reach leukemia cells in the CNS , the cells are able to hide in the CNS    .
Systemic chemotherapy given in high doses or intrathecal chemotherapy ( into the cerebrospinal fluid ) is able to reach leukemia cells in the CNS    .
Sometimes external radiation therapy to the brain is also given    .
These treatments are given in addition to treatment that is used to kill leukemia cells in the rest of the body    .
All children with ALL receive CNS - directed therapy as part of induction therapy and consolidation / intensification therapy and sometimes during maintenance therapy    .
If the leukemia cells spread to the testicles , treatment includes high doses of systemic chemotherapy and sometimes radiation therapy    .
New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials    .
This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials    .
It may not mention every new treatment being studied    .

Follow - up tests may be needed    .
Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated    .
Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working    .
Decisions about whether to continue , change , or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests    .
Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended    .
The results of these tests can show if your child 's condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred ( come back )    .
These tests are sometimes called follow - up tests or check - ups    .
Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy is done during all phases of treatment to see how well the treatment is working    .

What is (are) Childhood Acute Myeloid Leukemia and Other Myeloid Malignancies ?
Key Points
- Childhood acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) is a type of cancer in which the bone marrow makes a large number of abnormal blood cells    .
- Leukemia and other diseases of the blood and bone marrow may affect red blood cells , white blood cells , and platelets    .
- Other myeloid diseases can affect the blood and bone marrow    .
- Chronic myelogenous leukemia - Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia - Myelodysplastic syndromes - AML or MDS may occur after treatment with certain anticancer drugs and / or radiation therapy    .
- The risk factors for childhood AML , childhood CML , JMML , and MDS are similar    .
- Signs and symptoms of childhood AML , childhood CML , JMML , or MDS include fever , feeling tired , and easy bleeding or bruising    .
- Tests that examine the blood and bone marrow are used to detect ( find ) and diagnose childhood AML , childhood CML , JMML , and MDS    .
- Certain factors affect prognosis ( chance of recovery ) and treatment options    .
Childhood acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) is a type of cancer in which the bone marrow makes a large number of abnormal blood cells    .
Childhood acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) is a cancer of the blood and bone marrow    .
AML is also called acute myelogenous leukemia , acute myeloblastic leukemia , acute granulocytic leukemia , and acute nonlymphocytic leukemia    .
Cancers that are acute usually get worse quickly if they are not treated    .
Cancers that are chronic usually get worse slowly    .
Leukemia and other diseases of the blood and bone marrow may affect red blood cells , white blood cells , and platelets    .
Normally , the bone marrow makes blood stem cells ( immature cells ) that become mature blood cells over time    .
A blood stem cell may become a myeloid stem cell or a lymphoid stem cell    .
A lymphoid stem cell becomes a white blood cell    .
A myeloid stem cell becomes one of three types of mature blood cells : - Red blood cells that carry oxygen and other substances to all tissues of the body    .
- White blood cells that fight infection and disease    .
- Platelets that form blood clots to stop bleeding    .
In AML , the myeloid stem cells usually become a type of immature white blood cell called myeloblasts ( or myeloid blasts )    .
The myeloblasts , or leukemia cells , in AML are abnormal and do not become healthy white blood cells    .
The leukemia cells can build up in the blood and bone marrow so there is less room for healthy white blood cells , red blood cells , and platelets    .
When this happens , infection , anemia , or easy bleeding may occur    .
The leukemia cells can spread outside the blood to other parts of the body , including the central nervous system ( brain and spinal cord ) , skin , and gums    .
Sometimes leukemia cells form a solid tumor called a granulocytic sarcoma or chloroma    .
There are subtypes of AML based on the type of blood cell that is affected    .
The treatment of AML is different when it is a subtype called acute promyelocytic leukemia ( APL ) or when the child has Down syndrome    .
Other myeloid diseases can affect the blood and bone marrow    .
Chronic myelogenous leukemia
In chronic myelogenous leukemia ( CML ) , too many bone marrow stem cells become a type of white blood cell called granulocytes    .
Some of these bone marrow stem cells never become mature white blood cells    .
These are called blasts    .
Over time , the granulocytes and blasts crowd out the red blood cells and platelets in the bone marrow    .
CML is rare in children    .
Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia ( JMML ) is a rare childhood cancer that occurs more often in children around the age of 2 years and is more common in boys    .
In JMML , too many bone marrow stem cells become 2 types of white blood cells called myelocytes and monocytes    .
Some of these bone marrow stem cells never become mature white blood cells    .
These immature cells , called blasts , are unable to do their usual work    .
Over time , the myelocytes , monocytes , and blasts crowd out the red blood cells and platelets in the bone marrow    .
When this happens , infection , anemia , or easy bleeding may occur    .
Myelodysplastic syndromes Myelodysplastic syndromes ( MDS ) occur less often in children than in adults    .
In MDS , the bone marrow makes too few red blood cells , white blood cells , and platelets    .
These blood cells may not mature and enter the blood    .
The treatment for MDS depends on how low the numbers of red blood cells , white blood cells , or platelets are    .
Over time , MDS may become AML    .
Transient myeloproliferative disorder ( TMD ) is a type of MDS    .
This disorder of the bone marrow can develop in newborns who have Down syndrome    .
It usually goes away on its own within the first 3 weeks of life    .
Infants who have Down syndrome and TMD have an increased chance of developing AML before the age of 3 years    .
This summary is about childhood AML , childhood CML , JMML , and MDS    .
See the following PDQ summaries for more information about other types of leukemia and diseases of the blood and bone marrow in children and adults : - Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Treatment - Adult Acute Myeloid Leukemia Treatment - Adult Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Treatment - Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia Treatment - Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Treatment - Hairy Cell Leukemia Treatment - Myelodysplastic Syndromes Treatment - Myelodysplastic / Myeloproliferative Neoplasms Treatment
AML or MDS may occur after treatment with certain anticancer drugs and / or radiation therapy    .
Cancer treatment with certain anticancer drugs and / or radiation therapy may cause therapy - related AML ( t - AML ) or therapy - related MDS ( t - MDS )    .
The risk of these therapy - related myeloid diseases depends on the total dose of the anticancer drugs used and the radiation dose and treatment field    .
Some patients also have an inherited risk for t- AML and t- MDS    .
These therapy - related diseases usually occur within 7 years after treatment , but are rare in children    .
Who is at risk for Childhood Acute Myeloid Leukemia and Other Myeloid Malignancies? ?
The risk factors for childhood AML , childhood CML , JMML , and MDS are similar    .
Anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor    .
Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer ; not having risk factors doesnt mean that you will not get cancer    .
Talk with your childs doctor if you think your child may be at risk    .
These and other factors may increase the risk of childhood AML , childhood CML , JMML , and MDS : - Having a brother or sister , especially a twin , with leukemia    .
- Being Hispanic    .    - Being exposed to cigarette smoke or alcohol before birth    .
- Having a personal history of aplastic anemia    .
- Having a personal or family history of MDS    .
- Having a family history of AML    .
- Past treatment with chemotherapy or radiation therapy    .
- Being exposed to ionizing radiation or chemicals such as benzene    .
- Having certain genetic disorders , such as : - Down syndrome    .
- Fanconi anemia    .
- Neurofibromatosis type 1    .    - Noonan syndrome    .
- Shwachman - Diamond syndrome    .
What are the symptoms of Childhood Acute Myeloid Leukemia and Other Myeloid Malignancies ?
Signs and symptoms of childhood AML , childhood CML , JMML , or MDS include fever , feeling tired , and easy bleeding or bruising    .
These and other signs and symptoms may be caused by childhood AML , childhood CML , JMML , or MDS or by other conditions    .
Check with a doctor if your child has any of the following : - Fever with or without an infection    .
- Night sweats    .
- Shortness of breath    .
- Weakness or feeling tired    .
- Easy bruising or bleeding    .
- Petechiae ( flat , pinpoint spots under the skin caused by bleeding )    .
- Pain in the bones or joints    .
- Pain or feeling of fullness below the ribs    .
- Painless lumps in the neck , underarm , stomach , groin , or other parts of the body    .
In childhood AML , these lumps , called leukemia cutis , may be blue or purple    .
- Painless lumps that are sometimes around the eyes    .
These lumps , called chloromas , are sometimes seen in childhood AML and may be blue - green    .    - An eczema - like skin rash    .
The signs and symptoms of TMD may include the following : - Swelling all over the body    .
- Shortness of breath    .
- Trouble breathing    .
- Weakness or feeling tired    .
- Pain below the ribs    .
How to diagnose Childhood Acute Myeloid Leukemia and Other Myeloid Malignancies ?
Tests that examine the blood and bone marrow are used to detect ( find ) and diagnose childhood AML , childhood CML , JMML , and MDS    .
The following tests and procedures may be used : - Physical exam and history :
An exam of the body to check general signs of health , including checking for signs of disease , such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual    .
A history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken    .
- Complete blood count ( CBC ) with differential : A procedure in which a sample of blood is drawn and checked for the following : - The number of red blood cells and platelets    .
- The number and type of white blood cells    .
- The amount of hemoglobin ( the protein that carries oxygen ) in the red blood cells    .
- The portion of the blood sample made up of red blood cells    .
- Peripheral blood smear :
A procedure in which a sample of blood is checked for blast cells , the number and kinds of white blood cells , number of platelets , and changes in the shape of the blood cells    .
- Blood chemistry studies :
A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body    .
An unusual ( higher or lower than normal ) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease    .
- Chest x-ray :
An x-ray of the organs and bones inside the chest    .
An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film , making a picture of areas inside the body    .
- Biopsy :
The removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer    .
Biopsies that may be done include the following : - Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy :
The removal of bone marrow , blood , and a small piece of bone by inserting a hollow needle into the hipbone or breastbone    .
- Tumor biopsy : A biopsy of a chloroma may be done    .
- Lymph node biopsy :
The removal of all or part of a lymph node    .
- Cytogenetic analysis :
A laboratory test in which cells in a sample of blood or bone marrow are viewed under a microscope to look for certain changes in the chromosomes    .
Changes in the chromosomes may include when part of one chromosome is switched with part of another chromosome , part of one chromosome is missing or repeated , or part of one chromosome is turned upside down    .
The following test is a type of cytogenetic analysis : - FISH ( fluorescence in situ hybridization ) : A laboratory technique used to look at genes or chromosomes in cells and tissues    .
Pieces of DNA that contain a fluorescent dye are made in the laboratory and added to cells or tissues on a glass slide    .
When these pieces of DNA bind to specific genes or areas of chromosomes on the slide , they light up when viewed under a microscope with a special light    .
- Reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction ( RTPCR ) test : A laboratory test in which cells in a sample of tissue are studied using chemicals to look for certain changes in the structure or function of genes    .
- Immunophenotyping :
A process used to identify cells , based on the types of antigens or markers on the surface of the cell , that may include special staining of the blood and bone marrow cells    .
This process is used to diagnose the subtype of AML by comparing the cancer cells to normal cells of the immune system    .
- Molecular testing : A laboratory test to check for certain genes , proteins , or other molecules in a sample of blood or bone marrow    .
Molecular tests also check for certain changes in a gene or chromosome that may cause or affect the chance of developing AML    .
A molecular test may be used to help plan treatment , find out how well treatment is working , or make a prognosis    .
- Lumbar puncture : A procedure used to collect a sample of cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) from the spinal column    .
This is done by placing a needle between two bones in the spine and into the CSF around the spinal cord and removing a sample of the fluid    .
The sample of CSF is checked under a microscope for signs that leukemia cells have spread to the brain and spinal cord    .
This procedure is also called an LP or spinal tap    .
What is the outlook for Childhood Acute Myeloid Leukemia and Other Myeloid Malignancies ?
Certain factors affect prognosis ( chance of recovery ) and treatment options    .
The prognosis ( chance of recovery ) and treatment options for childhood AML depend on the following : - The age of the child when the cancer is diagnosed    .
- The race or ethnic group of the child    .
- Whether the child is greatly overweight    .
- Number of white blood cells in the blood at diagnosis    .
- Whether the AML occurred after previous cancer treatment    .
- The subtype of AML    .    - Whether there are certain chromosome or gene changes in the leukemia cells    .
- Whether the child has Down syndrome    .
Most children with AML and Down syndrome can be cured of their leukemia    .
- Whether the leukemia is in the central nervous system ( brain and spinal cord )    .
- How quickly the leukemia responds to treatment    .
- Whether the AML is newly diagnosed ( untreated ) or has recurred ( come back ) after being treated    .
- The length of time since treatment ended , for AML that has recurred    .
The prognosis and treatment options for childhood CML depend on how long it has been since the patient was diagnosed and how many blast cells are in the blood    .
The prognosis ( chance of recovery ) and treatment options for JMML depend on the following : - The age of the child when the cancer is diagnosed    .
- The type of gene affected and the number of genes that have changes    .
- How many red blood cells , white blood cells , or platelets are in the blood    .
- Whether the JMML is newly diagnosed ( untreated ) or has recurred after treatment    .
The prognosis ( chance of recovery ) and treatment options for MDS depend on the following : - Whether the MDS was caused by previous cancer treatment    .
- How low the numbers of red blood cells , white blood cells , or platelets are    .
- Whether the MDS is newly diagnosed ( untreated ) or has recurred after treatment    .
What are the stages of Childhood Acute Myeloid Leukemia and Other Myeloid Malignancies ?
Key Points
- Once childhood acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) has been diagnosed , tests are done to find out if the cancer has spread to other parts of the body    .
- There is no standard staging system for childhood AML , childhood chronic myelogenous leukemia ( CML ) , juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia ( JMML ) , or myelodysplastic syndromes ( MDS )    .
The following tests and procedures may be used to determine if the leukemia has spread : - Lumbar puncture :
A procedure used to collect a sample of cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) from the spinal column    .
This is done by placing a needle between two bones in the spine and into the CSF around the spinal cord and removing a sample of the fluid    .
The sample of CSF is checked under a microscope for signs that leukemia cells have spread to the brain and spinal cord    .
This procedure is also called an LP or spinal tap    .
- Biopsy of the testicles , ovaries , or skin :
The removal of cells or tissues from the testicles , ovaries , or skin so they can be viewed under a microscope to check for signs of cancer    .
This is done only if something unusual about the testicles , ovaries , or skin is found during the physical exam    .
There is no standard staging system for childhood AML , childhood chronic myelogenous leukemia ( CML ) , juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia ( JMML ) , or myelodysplastic syndromes ( MDS )    .
The extent or spread of cancer is usually described as stages    .
Instead of stages , treatment of childhood AML , childhood CML , JMML , and MDS is based on one or more of the following : - The type of disease or the subtype of AML    .
- Whether leukemia has spread outside the blood and bone marrow    .
- Whether the disease is newly diagnosed , in remission , or recurrent    .
Newly diagnosed childhood AML Newly diagnosed childhood AML has not been treated except to relieve signs and symptoms such as fever , bleeding , or pain , and one of the following is true : - More than 20 % of the cells in the bone marrow are blasts ( leukemia cells )    .
Childhood AML in remission
In childhood AML in remission , the disease has been treated and the following are true : - The complete blood count is almost normal    .
- Less than 5 % of the cells in the bone marrow are blasts ( leukemia cells )    .    - There are no signs or symptoms of leukemia in the brain , spinal cord , or other parts of the body    .
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Childhood Acute Myeloid Leukemia and Other Myeloid Malignancies ?
New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials    .
This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials    .
It may not mention every new treatment being studied    .
Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website    .
Biologic therapy Biologic therapy is a treatment that uses the patients immune system to fight cancer    .
Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost , direct , or restore the bodys natural defenses against cancer    .
This type of cancer treatment is also called biotherapy or immunotherapy    .
Natural killer ( NK ) cells are a type of biologic therapy    .
NK cells are white blood cells that can kill tumor cells    .
These may be taken from a donor and given to the patient by infusion to help kill leukemia cells    .
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
For some patients , taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice    .
Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process    .
Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment    .
Many of today 's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials    .
Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment    .
Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future    .
Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments , they often answer important questions and help move research forward    .
Patients can enter clinical trials before , during , or after starting their cancer treatment    .
Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment    .
Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better    .
There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring ( coming back ) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment    .
Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country    .
See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials    .
These have been retrieved from NCI 's listing of clinical trials    .
What are the treatments for Childhood Acute Myeloid Leukemia and Other Myeloid Malignancies ?
Key Points
- There are different types of treatment for children with acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) , chronic myelogenous leukemia ( CML ) , juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia ( JMML ) , or myelodysplastic syndromes ( MDS )    .
- Treatment is planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating childhood leukemia and other diseases of the blood    .
- Some cancer treatments cause side effects months or years after treatment has ended    .
- The treatment of childhood AML usually has two phases    .
- Seven types of standard treatment are used for childhood AML , childhood CML , JMML , or MDS    .
- Chemotherapy - Radiation therapy - Stem cell transplant - Targeted therapy - Other drug therapy - Watchful waiting - Supportive care - New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials    .
- Biologic therapy - Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
- Patients can enter clinical trials before , during , or after starting their cancer treatment    .
- Follow - up tests may be needed    .
There are different types of treatment for children with acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) , chronic myelogenous leukemia ( CML ) , juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia ( JMML ) , or myelodysplastic syndromes ( MDS )    .
Different types of treatment are available for children with AML , CML , JMML , or MDS    .
Some treatments are standard ( the currently used treatment ) , and some are being tested in clinical trials    .
A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer    .
When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment , the new treatment may become the standard treatment    .
Because cancer in children is rare , taking part in a clinical trial should be considered    .
Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment    .
Treatment is planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating childhood leukemia and other diseases of the blood    .
Treatment will be overseen by a pediatric oncologist , a doctor who specializes in treating children with cancer    .
The pediatric oncologist works with other healthcare providers who are experts in treating children with leukemia and who specialize in certain areas of medicine    .
These may include the following specialists : - Pediatrician    .    - Hematologist    .    - Medical oncologist    .
- Pediatric surgeon    .
- Radiation oncologist    .
- Neurologist    .    - Neuropathologist    .
- Neuroradiologist    .
- Pediatric nurse specialist    .
- Social worker    .
- Rehabilitation specialist    .
- Psychologist    .
Some cancer treatments cause side effects months or years after treatment has ended    .
Regular follow - up exams are very important    .
Some cancer treatments cause side effects that continue or appear months or years after cancer treatment has ended    .
These are called late effects    .
Late effects of cancer treatment may include : - Physical problems    .
- Changes in mood , feelings , thinking , learning , or memory    .
- Second cancers ( new types of cancer )    .
Some late effects may be treated or controlled    .
It is important that parents of children who are treated for AML or other blood diseases talk with their doctors about the effects cancer treatment can have on their child    .
( See the PDQ summary on Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer for more information )    .
The treatment of childhood AML usually has two phases    .
The treatment of childhood AML is done in phases : - Induction therapy :
This is the first phase of treatment    .
The goal is to kill the leukemia cells in the blood and bone marrow    .
This puts the leukemia into remission    .
- Consolidation / intensification therapy :
This is the second phase of treatment    .
It begins once the leukemia is in remission    .
The goal of therapy is to kill any remaining leukemia cells that may not be active but could begin to regrow and cause a relapse    .
Treatment called central nervous system ( CNS ) sanctuary therapy may be given during the induction phase of therapy    .
Because standard doses of chemotherapy may not reach leukemia cells in the CNS ( brain and spinal cord ) , the cells are able to find sanctuary ( hide ) in the CNS    .
Intrathecal chemotherapy is able to reach leukemia cells in the CNS    .
It is given to kill the leukemia cells and lessen the chance the leukemia will recur ( come back )    .
CNS sanctuary therapy is also called CNS prophylaxis    .
Seven types of standard treatment are used for childhood AML , childhood CML , JMML , or MDS    .
Chemotherapy Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells , either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing    .
When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle , the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body ( systemic chemotherapy )    .
When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid ( intrathecal chemotherapy ) , an organ , or a body cavity such as the abdomen , the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas ( regional chemotherapy )    .
Combination chemotherapy is treatment using more than one anticancer drug    .
The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type of cancer being treated    .
In AML , the leukemia cells may spread to the brain and / or spinal cord    .
Chemotherapy given by mouth or vein to treat AML may not cross the blood - brain barrier to get into the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord    .
Instead , chemotherapy is injected into the fluid - filled space to kill leukemia cells that may have spread there ( intrathecal chemotherapy )    .
See Drugs Approved for Acute Myeloid Leukemia for more information    .
Radiation therapy Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high - energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing    .
There are two types of radiation therapy : - External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer    .
- Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles , seeds , wires , or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer    .
The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type of the cancer being treated    .
In childhood AML , external radiation therapy may be used to treat a chloroma that does not respond to chemotherapy    .
Stem cell transplant
Stem cell transplant is a way of giving chemotherapy and replacing blood - forming cells that are abnormal or destroyed by the cancer treatment    .
Stem cells ( immature blood cells ) are removed from the blood or bone marrow of the patient or a donor and are frozen and stored    .
After the chemotherapy is completed , the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion    .
These reinfused stem cells grow into ( and restore ) the body 's blood cells    .
Targeted therapy Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells    .
Types of targeted therapy include the following : - Tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy : Tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKI ) therapy blocks signals needed for tumors to grow    .
TKIs block the enzyme ( tyrosine kinase ) that causes stem cells to become more white blood cells ( granulocytes or blasts ) than the body needs    .
TKIs may be used with other anticancer drugs as adjuvant therapy ( treatment given after the initial treatment , to lower the risk that the cancer will come back )    .
- Imatinib is a type of TKI that is approved to treat childhood CML    .
- Sorafenib , dasatinib , and nilotinib are being studied in the treatment of childhood leukemia    .
- Monoclonal antibody therapy : Monoclonal antibody therapy uses antibodies made in the laboratory , from a single type of immune system cell    .
These antibodies can identify substances on cancer cells or normal substances that may help cancer cells grow    .
The antibodies attach to the substances and kill the cancer cells , block their growth , or keep them from spreading    .
Monoclonal antibodies are given by infusion    .
They may be used alone or to carry drugs , toxins , or radioactive material directly to cancer cells    .
- Gemtuzumab is a type of monoclonal antibody used in the treatment of a subtype of AML called acute promyelocytic leukemia ( APL )    .
Gemtuzumab is not available in the United States unless special approval is given    .
Monoclonal antibodies may be used with chemotherapy as adjuvant therapy    .
- Proteasome inhibitor therapy : Proteasome inhibitors break down proteins in cancer cells and kill them    .
- Bortezomib is a proteasome inhibitor used to treat childhood APL    .
See Drugs Approved for Leukemia for more information    .
Other drug therapy Lenalidomide may be used to lessen the need for transfusions in patients who have myelodysplastic syndromes caused by a specific chromosome change    .
Arsenic trioxide and all - trans retinoic acid ( ATRA ) are anticancer drugs that kill leukemia cells , stop the leukemia cells from dividing , or help the leukemia cells mature into white blood cells    .
These drugs are used in the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia    .
See Drugs Approved for Acute Myeloid Leukemia for more information    .
Watchful waiting Watchful waiting is closely monitoring a patients condition without giving any treatment until signs or symptoms appear or change    .
It is sometimes used to treat MDS or TMD    .
Supportive care Supportive care is given to lessen the problems caused by the disease or its treatment    .
Supportive care may include the following : - Transfusion therapy : A way of giving red blood cells , white blood cells , or platelets to replace blood cells destroyed by disease or cancer treatment    .
The blood may be donated from another person or it may have been taken from the patient earlier and stored until needed    .
- Drug therapy , such as antibiotics or antifungal agents    .
- Leukapheresis :
A procedure in which a special machine is used to remove white blood cells from the blood    .
Blood is taken from the patient and put through a blood cell separator where the white blood cells are removed    .
The rest of the blood is then returned to the patient 's bloodstream    .
New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials    .
This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials    .
It may not mention every new treatment being studied    .
Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website    .
Biologic therapy Biologic therapy is a treatment that uses the patients immune system to fight cancer    .
Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost , direct , or restore the bodys natural defenses against cancer    .
This type of cancer treatment is also called biotherapy or immunotherapy    .
Natural killer ( NK ) cells are a type of biologic therapy    .
NK cells are white blood cells that can kill tumor cells    .
These may be taken from a donor and given to the patient by infusion to help kill leukemia cells    .
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
For some patients , taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice    .
Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process    .
Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment    .
Many of today 's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials    .
Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment    .
Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future    .
Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments , they often answer important questions and help move research forward    .
Patients can enter clinical trials before , during , or after starting their cancer treatment    .
Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment    .
Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better    .
There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring ( coming back ) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment    .
Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country    .
See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials    .
These have been retrieved from NCI 's listing of clinical trials    .
Follow - up tests may be needed    .
Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated    .
Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working    .
Decisions about whether to continue , change , or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests    .
Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended    .
The results of these tests can show if your child 's condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred ( come back )    .
These tests are sometimes called follow - up tests or check - ups    .

What is (are) Adult Soft Tissue Sarcoma ?
Key Points
- Adult soft tissue sarcoma is a disease in which malignant ( cancer ) cells form in the soft tissues of the body    .
- Having certain inherited disorders can increase the risk of adult soft tissue sarcoma    .    - A sign of adult soft tissue sarcoma is a lump or swelling in soft tissue of the body    .
- Adult soft tissue sarcoma is diagnosed with a biopsy    .
- Certain factors affect treatment options and prognosis ( chance of recovery )    .
Adult soft tissue sarcoma is a disease in which malignant ( cancer ) cells form in the soft tissues of the body    .
The soft tissues of the body include the muscles , tendons ( bands of fiber that connect muscles to bones ) , fat , blood vessels , lymph vessels , nerves , and tissues around joints    .
Adult soft tissue sarcomas can form almost anywhere in the body , but are most common in the head , neck , arms , legs , trunk , and abdomen    .
There are many types of soft tissue sarcoma    .
The cells of each type of sarcoma look different under a microscope , based on the type of soft tissue in which the cancer began    .
See the following PDQ summaries for more information on soft tissue sarcomas : - Childhood Soft Tissue Sarcoma Treatment - Ewing Sarcoma Family of Tumors Treatment - Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors Treatment - Kaposi Sarcoma Treatment - Uterine Sarcoma Treatment
Who is at risk for Adult Soft Tissue Sarcoma? ?
Having certain inherited disorders can increase the risk of adult soft tissue sarcoma    .
Anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor    .
Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer ; not having risk factors does n't mean that you will not get cancer    .
Talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk    .
Risk factors for soft tissue sarcoma include the following inherited disorders : - Retinoblastoma    .    - Neurofibromatosis type 1 ( NF1 ; von Recklinghausen disease )    .
- Tuberous sclerosis ( Bourneville disease )    .
- Familial adenomatous polyposis ( FAP ; Gardner syndrome )    .
- Li-Fraumeni syndrome    .    - Werner syndrome ( adult progeria )    .
- Nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome ( Gorlin syndrome )    .
Other risk factors for soft tissue sarcoma include the following : - Past treatment with radiation therapy for certain cancers    .
- Being exposed to certain chemicals , such as Thorotrast ( thorium dioxide ) , vinyl chloride , or arsenic    .
- Having swelling ( lymphedema ) in the arms or legs for a long time    .
What are the symptoms of Adult Soft Tissue Sarcoma ?
A sign of adult soft tissue sarcoma is a lump or swelling in soft tissue of the body    .
A sarcoma may appear as a painless lump under the skin , often on an arm or a leg    .
Sarcomas that begin in the abdomen may not cause signs or symptoms until they get very big    .
As the sarcoma grows bigger and presses on nearby organs , nerves , muscles , or blood vessels , signs and symptoms may include : - Pain    .    - Trouble breathing    .
Other conditions may cause the same signs and symptoms    .
Check with your doctor if you have any of these problems    .
How to diagnose Adult Soft Tissue Sarcoma ?
Adult soft tissue sarcoma is diagnosed with a biopsy    .
If your doctor thinks you may have a soft tissue sarcoma , a biopsy will be done    .
The type of biopsy will be based on the size of the tumor and where it is in the body    .
There are three types of biopsy that may be used : - Incisional biopsy :
The removal of part of a lump or a sample of tissue    .
- Core biopsy :
The removal of tissue using a wide needle    .
- Excisional biopsy :
The removal of an entire lump or area of tissue that doesnt look normal    .
Samples will be taken from the primary tumor , lymph nodes , and other suspicious areas    .
A pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells and to find out the grade of the tumor    .
The grade of a tumor depends on how abnormal the cancer cells look under a microscope and how quickly the cells are dividing    .
High - grade tumors usually grow and spread more quickly than low - grade tumors    .
Because soft tissue sarcoma can be hard to diagnose , patients should ask to have tissue samples checked by a pathologist who has experience in diagnosing soft tissue sarcoma    .
The following tests may be done on the tissue that was removed : - Immunohistochemistry :
A test that uses antibodies to check for certain antigens in a sample of tissue    .
The antibody is usually linked to a radioactive substance or a dye that causes the tissue to light up under a microscope    .
This type of test may be used to tell the difference between different types of cancer    .
- Light and electron microscopy :
A laboratory test in which cells in a sample of tissue are viewed under regular and high - powered microscopes to look for certain changes in the cells    .
- Cytogenetic analysis :
A laboratory test in which cells in a sample of tissue are viewed under a microscope to look for certain changes in the chromosomes    .
- FISH ( fluorescence in situ hybridization ) : A laboratory test used to look at genes or chromosomes in cells and tissues    .
Pieces of DNA that contain a fluorescent dye are made in the laboratory and added to cells or tissues on a glass slide    .
When these pieces of DNA attach to certain genes or areas of chromosomes on the slide , they light up when viewed under a microscope with a special light    .
- Flow cytometry :
A laboratory test that measures the number of cells in a sample , the percentage of live cells in a sample , and certain characteristics of cells , such as size , shape , and the presence of tumor markers on the cell surface    .
The cells are stained with a light - sensitive dye , placed in a fluid , and passed in a stream before a laser or other type of light    .
The measurements are based on how the light - sensitive dye reacts to the light    .
What is the outlook for Adult Soft Tissue Sarcoma ?
Certain factors affect treatment options and prognosis ( chance of recovery )    .
The treatment options and prognosis ( chance of recovery ) depend on the following : - The type of soft tissue sarcoma    .    - The size , grade , and stage of the tumor    .
- How fast the cancer cells are growing and dividing    .
- Where the tumor is in the body    .
- Whether all of the tumor is removed by surgery    .
- The patient 's age and general health    .
- Whether the cancer has recurred ( come back )    .
What are the stages of Adult Soft Tissue Sarcoma ?
Key Points
- After adult soft tissue sarcoma has been diagnosed , tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the soft tissue or to other parts of the body    .
- There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body    .
- Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body    .
- The following stages are used for adult soft tissue sarcoma : - Stage I - Stage II - Stage III - Stage IV
After adult soft tissue sarcoma has been diagnosed , tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the soft tissue or to other parts of the body    .
The process used to find out if cancer has spread within the soft tissue or to other parts of the body is called staging    .
Staging of soft tissue sarcoma is also based on the grade and size of the tumor , whether it is superficial ( close to the skin 's surface ) or deep , and whether it has spread to the lymph nodes or other parts of the body    .
The information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease    .
It is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment    .
The following tests and procedures may be used in the staging process : - Physical exam and history :
An exam of the body to check general signs of health , including checking for signs of disease , such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual    .
A history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken    .
- Chest x-ray :
An x-ray of the organs and bones inside the chest    .
An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film , making a picture of areas inside the body    .
- Blood chemistry studies :
A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body    .
An unusual ( higher or lower than normal ) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease    .
- Complete blood count ( CBC ) : A procedure in which a sample of blood is drawn and checked for the following : - The number of red blood cells , white blood cells , and platelets    .
- The amount of hemoglobin ( the protein that carries oxygen ) in the red blood cells    .
- The portion of the blood sample made up of red blood cells    .
- CT scan ( CAT scan ) : A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside of the body , such as the lung and abdomen , taken from different angles    .
The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine    .
A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly    .
This procedure is also called computed tomography , computerized tomography , or computerized axial tomography    .
- MRI ( magnetic resonance imaging ) : A procedure that uses a magnet , radio waves , and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body    .
This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging ( NMRI )    .
- PET scan ( positron emission tomography scan ) : A procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body    .
A small amount of radioactive glucose ( sugar ) is injected into a vein    .
The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body    .
Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do    .
The results of these tests are viewed together with the results of the tumor biopsy to find out the stage of the soft tissue sarcoma before treatment is given    .
Sometimes chemotherapy or radiation therapy is given as the initial treatment and afterwards the soft tissue sarcoma is staged again    .
There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body    .
Cancer can spread through tissue , the lymph system , and the blood : - Tissue    .
The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas    .
- Lymph system    .
The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system    .
The cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body    .
- Blood    .
The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood    .
The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body    .
Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body    .
When cancer spreads to another part of the body , it is called metastasis    .
Cancer cells break away from where they began ( the primary tumor ) and travel through the lymph system or blood    .
- Lymph system    .
The cancer gets into the lymph system , travels through the lymph vessels , and forms a tumor ( metastatic tumor ) in another part of the body    .
- Blood    .
The cancer gets into the blood , travels through the blood vessels , and forms a tumor ( metastatic tumor ) in another part of the body    .
The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor    .
For example , if soft tissue sarcoma spreads to the lung , the cancer cells in the lung are actually soft tissue sarcoma cells    .
The disease is metastatic soft tissue sarcoma , not lung cancer    .
The following stages are used for adult soft tissue sarcoma :
Stage I Stage I is divided into stages IA and IB : - In stage IA , the tumor is low - grade ( likely to grow and spread slowly ) and 5 centimeters or smaller    .
It may be either superficial ( in subcutaneous tissue with no spread into connective tissue or muscle below ) or deep ( in the muscle and may be in connective or subcutaneous tissue )    .
- In stage IB , the tumor is low - grade ( likely to grow and spread slowly ) and larger than 5 centimeters    .
It may be either superficial ( in subcutaneous tissue with no spread into connective tissue or muscle below ) or deep ( in the muscle and may be in connective or subcutaneous tissue )    .
Stage II Stage II is divided into stages IIA and IIB : - In stage IIA , the tumor is mid-grade ( somewhat likely to grow and spread quickly ) or high - grade ( likely to grow and spread quickly ) and 5 centimeters or smaller    .
It may be either superficial ( in subcutaneous tissue with no spread into connective tissue or muscle below ) or deep ( in the muscle and may be in connective or subcutaneous tissue )    .
- In stage IIB , the tumor is mid-grade ( somewhat likely to grow and spread quickly ) and larger than 5 centimeters    .
It may be either superficial ( in subcutaneous tissue with no spread into connective tissue or muscle below ) or deep ( in the muscle and may be in connective or subcutaneous tissue )    .
Stage III
In stage III , the tumor is either : - high - grade ( likely to grow and spread quickly ) , larger than 5 centimeters , and either superficial ( in subcutaneous tissue with no spread into connective tissue or muscle below ) or deep ( in the muscle and may be in connective or subcutaneous tissue ) ; or - any grade , any size , and has spread to nearby lymph nodes    .
Stage III cancer that has spread to the lymph nodes is advanced stage III    .
Stage IV
In stage IV , the tumor is any grade , any size , and may have spread to nearby lymph nodes    .
Cancer has spread to distant parts of the body , such as the lungs    .
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Adult Soft Tissue Sarcoma ?
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
For some patients , taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice    .
Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process    .

There are different types of treatment for patients with adult soft tissue sarcoma    .
Different types of treatments are available for patients with adult soft tissue sarcoma    .
Some treatments are standard ( the currently used treatment ) , and some are being tested in clinical trials    .
A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer    .
When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment , the new treatment may become the standard treatment    .
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment    .
Three types of standard treatment are used :
Surgery Surgery is the most common treatment for adult soft tissue sarcoma    .
For some soft - tissue sarcomas , removal of the tumor in surgery may be the only treatment needed    .
The following surgical procedures may be used : - Mohs microsurgery : A procedure in which the tumor is cut from the skin in thin layers    .
During surgery , the edges of the tumor and each layer of tumor removed are viewed through a microscope to check for cancer cells    .
Layers continue to be removed until no more cancer cells are seen    .
This type of surgery removes as little normal tissue as possible and is often used where appearance is important , such as on the skin    .
- Wide local excision : Removal of the tumor along with some normal tissue around it    .
For tumors of the head , neck , abdomen , and trunk , as little normal tissue as possible is removed    .
- Limb - sparing surgery : Removal of the tumor in an arm or leg without amputation , so the use and appearance of the limb is saved    .
Radiation therapy or chemotherapy may be given first to shrink the tumor    .
The tumor is then removed in a wide local excision    .
Tissue and bone that are removed may be replaced with a graft using tissue and bone taken from another part of the patient 's body , or with an implant such as artificial bone    .
- Amputation : Surgery to remove part or all of a limb or appendage , such as an arm or leg    .
Amputation is rarely used to treat soft tissue sarcoma of the arm or leg    .
- Lymphadenectomy : A surgical procedure in which lymph nodes are removed and a sample of tissue is checked under a microscope for signs of cancer    .
This procedure is also called a lymph node dissection    .
Radiation therapy or chemotherapy may be given before or after surgery to remove the tumor    .
When given before surgery , radiation therapy or chemotherapy will make the tumor smaller and reduce the amount of tissue that needs to be removed during surgery    .
Treatment given before surgery is called neoadjuvant therapy    .
When given after surgery , radiation therapy or chemotherapy will kill any remaining cancer cells    .
Treatment given after the surgery , to lower the risk that the cancer will come back , is called adjuvant therapy    .
Radiation therapy Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high - energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing    .
There are two types of radiation therapy : - External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer    .
- Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles , seeds , wires , or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer    .
Intensity - modulated radiation therapy ( IMRT ) is a type of 3 - dimensional ( 3 - D ) radiation therapy that uses a computer to make pictures of the size and shape of the tumor    .
Thin beams of radiation of different intensities ( strengths ) are aimed at the tumor from many angles    .
This type of external radiation therapy causes less damage to nearby healthy tissue and is less likely to cause dry mouth , trouble swallowing , and damage to the skin    .
The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated    .
External radiation therapy and internal radiation therapy may be used to treat adult soft tissue sarcoma    .
Chemotherapy Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells , either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing    .
When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle , the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body ( systemic chemotherapy )    .
The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated    .
See Drugs Approved for Soft Tissue Sarcoma for more information    .
New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials    .
This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials    .
It may not mention every new treatment being studied    .
Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website    .
Regional chemotherapy Clinical trials are studying ways to improve the effect of chemotherapy on tumor cells , including the following : - Regional hyperthermia therapy : A treatment in which tissue around the tumor is exposed to high temperatures to damage and kill cancer cells or to make cancer cells more sensitive to chemotherapy    .
- Isolated limb perfusion : A procedure that sends chemotherapy directly to an arm or leg in which the cancer has formed    .
The flow of blood to and from the limb is temporarily stopped with a tourniquet , and anticancer drugs are put directly into the blood of the limb    .
This sends a high dose of drugs to the tumor    .
Treatment for adult soft tissue sarcoma may cause side effects    .
For information about side effects caused by treatment for cancer , see our Side Effects page    .
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
For some patients , taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice    .
Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process    .
Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment    .
Many of today 's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials    .
Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment    .
Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future    .
Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments , they often answer important questions and help move research forward    .
Patients can enter clinical trials before , during , or after starting their cancer treatment    .
Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment    .
Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better    .
There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring ( coming back ) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment    .
Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country    .
See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials    .
These have been retrieved from NCI 's listing of clinical trials    .
Follow - up tests may be needed    .
Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated    .
Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working    .
Decisions about whether to continue , change , or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests    .
Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended    .
The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred ( come back )    .
These tests are sometimes called follow - up tests or check - ups    .

What is (are) Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors ?
Key Points
- Gastrointestinal stromal tumor is a disease in which abnormal cells form in the tissues of the gastrointestinal tract    .
- Genetic factors can increase the risk of having a gastrointestinal stromal tumor    .
- Signs of gastrointestinal stromal tumors include blood in the stool or vomit    .
- Tests that examine the GI tract are used to detect ( find ) and diagnose gastrointestinal stromal tumors    .
- Very small GISTs are common    .
- Certain factors affect prognosis ( chance of recovery ) and treatment options    .
Gastrointestinal stromal tumor is a disease in which abnormal cells form in the tissues of the gastrointestinal tract    .
The gastrointestinal ( GI ) tract is part of the bodys digestive system    .
It helps to digest food and takes nutrients ( vitamins , minerals , carbohydrates , fats , proteins , and water ) from food so they can be used by the body    .
The GI tract is made up of the following organs : - Stomach    .    - Small intestine    .    - Large intestine ( colon )    .
Gastrointestinal stromal tumors ( GISTs ) may be malignant ( cancer ) or benign ( not cancer )    .
They are most common in the stomach and small intestine but may be found anywhere in or near the GI tract    .
Some scientists believe that GISTs begin in cells called interstitial cells of Cajal ( ICC ) , in the wall of the GI tract    .
See the PDQ summary about Unusual Cancers of Childhood Treatment for information on the treatment of GIST in children    .
Very small GISTs are common    .
Sometimes GISTs are smaller than the eraser on top of a pencil    .
Tumors may be found during a procedure that is done for another reason , such as an x-ray or surgery    .
Some of these small tumors will not grow and cause signs or symptoms or spread to the abdomen or other parts of the body    .
Doctors do not agree on whether these small tumors should be removed or whether they should be watched to see if they begin to grow    .
Who is at risk for Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors? ?
Genetic factors can increase the risk of having a gastrointestinal stromal tumor    .
Anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor    .
Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer ; not having risk factors does n't mean that you will not get cancer    .
Talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk    .
The genes in cells carry the hereditary information received from a persons parents    .
The risk of GIST is increased in people who have inherited a mutation ( change ) in a certain gene    .
In rare cases , GISTs can be found in several members of the same family    .
GIST may be part of a genetic syndrome , but this is rare    .
A genetic syndrome is a set of symptoms or conditions that occur together and is usually caused by abnormal genes    .
The following genetic syndromes have been linked to GIST : - Neurofibromatosis type 1 ( NF1 )    .    - Carney triad    .
What are the symptoms of Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors ?
Signs of gastrointestinal stromal tumors include blood in the stool or vomit    .
These and other signs and symptoms may be caused by a GIST or by other conditions    .
Check with your doctor if you have any of the following : - Blood ( either bright red or very dark ) in the stool or vomit    .
- Pain in the abdomen , which may be severe    .
- Feeling very tired    .
- Trouble or pain when swallowing    .
- Feeling full after only a little food is eaten    .
What are the stages of Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors ?
Key Points
- After a gastrointestinal stromal tumor has been diagnosed , tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the gastrointestinal tract or to other parts of the body    .
- There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body    .
- Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body    .
- The results of diagnostic and staging tests are used to plan treatment    .
After a gastrointestinal stromal tumor has been diagnosed , tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the gastrointestinal tract or to other parts of the body    .
The process used to find out if cancer has spread within the gastrointestinal ( GI ) tract or to other parts of the body is called staging    .
The information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease    .
The following tests and procedures may be used in the staging process : - PET scan ( positron emission tomography scan ) : A procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body    .
A small amount of radioactive glucose ( sugar ) is injected into a vein    .
The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body    .
Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do    .
- CT scan ( CAT scan ) : A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body , taken from different angles    .
The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine    .
A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly    .
This procedure is also called computed tomography , computerized tomography , or computerized axial tomography    .
- MRI ( magnetic resonance imaging ) : A procedure that uses a magnet , radio waves , and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body    .
This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging ( NMRI )    .
- Chest x-ray :
An x-ray of the organs and bones inside the chest    .
An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film , making a picture of areas inside the body    .
- Bone scan :
A procedure to check if there are rapidly dividing cells , such as cancer cells , in the bone    .
A very small amount of radioactive material is injected into a vein and travels through the bloodstream    .
The radioactive material collects in the bones and is detected by a scanner    .
There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body    .
Cancer can spread through tissue , the lymph system , and the blood : - Tissue    .
The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas    .
- Lymph system    .
The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system    .
The cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body    .
- Blood    .
The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood    .
The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body    .
Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body    .
When cancer spreads to another part of the body , it is called metastasis    .
Cancer cells break away from where they began ( the primary tumor ) and travel through the lymph system or blood    .
- Lymph system    .
The cancer gets into the lymph system , travels through the lymph vessels , and forms a tumor ( metastatic tumor ) in another part of the body    .
- Blood    .
The cancer gets into the blood , travels through the blood vessels , and forms a tumor ( metastatic tumor ) in another part of the body    .
The metastatic tumor is the same type of tumor as the primary tumor    .
For example , if a gastrointestinal stromal tumor ( GIST ) spreads to the liver , the tumor cells in the liver are actually GIST cells    .
The disease is metastatic GIST , not liver cancer    .
The results of diagnostic and staging tests are used to plan treatment    .
For many cancers it is important to know the stage of the cancer in order to plan treatment    .
However , the treatment of GIST is not based on the stage of the cancer    .
Treatment is based on whether the tumor can be removed by surgery and if the tumor has spread to other parts of the abdomen or to distant parts of the body    .
Treatment is based on whether the tumor is : - Resectable :
These tumors can be removed by surgery    .
- Unresectable :
These tumors cannot be completely removed by surgery    .
- Metastatic and recurrent : Metastatic tumors have spread to other parts of the body    .
Recurrent tumors have recurred ( come back ) after treatment    .
Recurrent GISTs may come back in the gastrointestinal tract or in other parts of the body    .
They are usually found in the abdomen , peritoneum , and / or liver    .
- Refractory :
These tumors have not gotten better with treatment    .
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors ?
New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials    .
Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website    .
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
For some patients , taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice    .
Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process    .

What are the treatments for Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors ?
Key Points
- There are different types of treatment for patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumors    .
- Four types of standard treatment are used : - Surgery - Targeted therapy - Watchful waiting - Supportive care - New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials    .
- Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
- Patients can enter clinical trials before , during , or after starting their cancer treatment    .
- Follow - up tests may be needed    .
There are different types of treatment for patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumors    .
Different types of treatments are available for patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumors ( GISTs )    .
Some treatments are standard ( the currently used treatment ) , and some are being tested in clinical trials    .
A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer    .
When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment , the new treatment may become the standard treatment    .
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment    .
Four types of standard treatment are used :
Surgery
If the GIST has not spread and is in a place where surgery can be safely done , the tumor and some of the tissue around it may be removed    .
Sometimes surgery is done using a laparoscope ( a thin , lighted tube ) to see inside the body    .
Small incisions ( cuts ) are made in the wall of the abdomen and a laparoscope is inserted into one of the incisions    .
Instruments may be inserted through the same incision or through other incisions to remove organs or tissues    .
Targeted therapy Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells    .
Tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( TKIs ) are targeted therapy drugs that block signals needed for tumors to grow    .
TKIs may be used to treat GISTs that cannot be removed by surgery or to shrink GISTs so they become small enough to be removed by surgery    .
Imatinib mesylate and sunitinib are two TKIs used to treat GISTs    .
TKIs are sometimes given for as long as the tumor does not grow and serious side effects do not occur    .
See Drugs Approved for Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors for more information    .
Watchful waiting Watchful waiting is closely monitoring a patients condition without giving any treatment until signs or symptoms appear or change    .
Supportive care
If a GIST gets worse during treatment or there are side effects , supportive care is usually given    .
The goal of supportive care is to prevent or treat the symptoms of a disease , side effects caused by treatment , and psychological , social , and spiritual problems related to a disease or its treatment    .
Supportive care helps improve the quality of life of patients who have a serious or life - threatening disease    .
Radiation therapy is sometimes given as supportive care to relieve pain in patients with large tumors that have spread    .
New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials    .

Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated    .
Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working    .
Decisions about whether to continue , change , or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests    .
Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended    .
The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred ( come back )    .
These tests are sometimes called follow - up tests or check - ups    .
Follow - up for GISTs that were removed by surgery may include CT scan of the liver and pelvis or watchful waiting    .
For GISTs that are treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors , follow - up tests , such as CT , MRI , or PET scans , may be done to check how well the targeted therapy is working    .
Treatment Options for Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors
Resectable Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors
Resectable gastrointestinal stromal tumors ( GISTs ) can be completely or almost completely removed by surgery    .
Treatment may include the following : - Surgery to remove tumors that are 2 centimeters or larger    .
Laparoscopic surgery may be done if the tumor is 5 cm or smaller    .
If there are cancer cells remaining at the edges of the area where the tumor was removed , watchful waiting or targeted therapy with imatinib mesylate may follow    .
- A clinical trial of targeted therapy with imatinib mesylate following surgery , to decrease the chance the tumor will recur ( come back )    .
Unresectable Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors
Unresectable GISTs cannot be completely removed by surgery because they are too large or in a place where there would be too much damage to nearby organs if the tumor is removed    .
Treatment is usually a clinical trial of targeted therapy with imatinib mesylate to shrink the tumor , followed by surgery to remove as much of the tumor as possible    .
Metastatic and Recurrent Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors
Treatment of GISTs that are metastatic ( spread to other parts of the body ) or recurrent ( came back after treatment ) may include the following : - Targeted therapy with imatinib mesylate    .
- Targeted therapy with sunitinib , if the tumor begins to grow during imatinib mesylate therapy or if the side effects are too bad    .
- Surgery to remove tumors that have been treated with targeted therapy and are shrinking , stable ( not changing ) , or that have slightly increased in size    .
Targeted therapy may continue after surgery    .
- Surgery to remove tumors when there are serious complications , such as bleeding , a hole in the gastrointestinal ( GI ) tract , a blocked GI tract , or infection    .    - A clinical trial of a new treatment    .
Refractory Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors
Many GISTs treated with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKI ) become refractory ( stop responding ) to the drug after a while    .
Treatment is usually a clinical trial with a different TKI or a clinical trial of a new drug    .
Treatment Options in Clinical Trials
Check the list of NCI - supported cancer clinical trials that are now accepting patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumor    .
For more specific results , refine the search by using other search features , such as the location of the trial , the type of treatment , or the name of the drug    .
Talk with your doctor about clinical trials that may be right for you    .

What is (are) Kaposi Sarcoma ?
Key Points
- Kaposi sarcoma is a disease in which malignant tumors ( cancer ) can form in the skin , mucous membranes , lymph nodes , and other organs    .
- Tests that examine the skin , lungs , and gastrointestinal tract are used to detect ( find ) and diagnose Kaposi sarcoma    .
- After Kaposi sarcoma has been diagnosed , tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread to other parts of the body    .
- Certain factors affect prognosis ( chance of recovery ) and treatment options    .
Kaposi sarcoma is a disease in which malignant tumors ( cancer ) can form in the skin , mucous membranes , lymph nodes , and other organs    .
Kaposi sarcoma is a cancer that causes lesions ( abnormal tissue ) to grow in the skin ; the mucous membranes lining the mouth , nose , and throat ; lymph nodes ; or other organs    .
The lesions are usually purple and are made of cancer cells , new blood vessels , red blood cells , and white blood cells    .
Kaposi sarcoma is different from other cancers in that lesions may begin in more than one place in the body at the same time    .
Human herpesvirus - 8 ( HHV - 8 ) is found in the lesions of all patients with Kaposi sarcoma    .
This virus is also called Kaposi sarcoma herpesvirus ( KSHV )    .
Most people infected with HHV - 8 do not get Kaposi sarcoma    .
Those infected with HHV - 8 who are most likely to develop Kaposi sarcoma have immune systems weakened by disease or by drugs given after an organ transplant    .
There are several types of Kaposi sarcoma , including : - Classic Kaposi sarcoma    .    - African Kaposi sarcoma    .    - Immunosuppressive therapyrelated Kaposi sarcoma    .    - Epidemic Kaposi sarcoma    .    - Nonepidemic Kaposi sarcoma    .
Tests that examine the skin , lungs , and gastrointestinal tract are used to detect ( find ) and diagnose Kaposi sarcoma    .
The following tests and procedures may be used : - Physical exam and history :
An exam of the body to check general signs of health , including checking skin and lymph nodes for signs of disease , such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual    .
A history of the patient 's health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken    .
- Chest x-ray :
An x-ray of the organs and bones inside the chest    .
An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film , making a picture of areas inside the body    .
This is used to find Kaposi sarcoma in the lungs    .
- Biopsy :
The removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer    .
One of the following types of biopsies may be done to check for Kaposi sarcoma lesions in the skin : - Excisional biopsy :
A scalpel is used to remove the entire skin growth    .
- Incisional biopsy : A scalpel is used to remove part of a skin growth    .
- Core biopsy :
A wide needle is used to remove part of a skin growth    .
- Fine - needle aspiration ( FNA ) biopsy :
A thin needle is used to remove part of a skin growth    .
An endoscopy or bronchoscopy may be done to check for Kaposi sarcoma lesions in the gastrointestinal tract or lungs    .
- Endoscopy for biopsy : A procedure to look at organs and tissues inside the body to check for abnormal areas    .
An endoscope is inserted through an incision ( cut ) in the skin or opening in the body , such as the mouth    .
An endoscope is a thin , tube - like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing    .
It may also have a tool to remove tissue or lymph node samples , which are checked under a microscope for signs of disease    .
This is used to find Kaposi sarcoma lesions in the gastrointestinal tract    .
- Bronchoscopy for biopsy : A procedure to look inside the trachea and large airways in the lung for abnormal areas    .
A bronchoscope is inserted through the nose or mouth into the trachea and lungs    .
A bronchoscope is a thin , tube - like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing    .
It may also have a tool to remove tissue samples , which are checked under a microscope for signs of disease    .
This is used to find Kaposi sarcoma lesions in the lungs    .
After Kaposi sarcoma has been diagnosed , tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread to other parts of the body    .
The following tests and procedures may be used to find out if cancer has spread to other parts of the body : - Blood chemistry studies :
A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body    .
An unusual ( higher or lower than normal ) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease    .
- CT scan ( CAT scan ) : A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body , such as the lung , liver , and spleen , taken from different angles    .
The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine    .
A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly    .
This procedure is also called computed tomography , computerized tomography , or computerized axial tomography    .
- PET scan ( positron emission tomography scan ) : A procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body    .
A small amount of radioactive glucose ( sugar ) is injected into a vein    .
The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body    .
Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do    .
This imaging test checks for signs of cancer in the lung , liver , and spleen    .
- CD34 lymphocyte count : A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amount of CD34 cells ( a type of white blood cell )    .
A lower than normal amount of CD34 cells can be a sign the immune system is not working well    .
Certain factors affect prognosis ( chance of recovery ) and treatment options    .
The prognosis ( chance of recovery ) and treatment options depend on the following : - The type of Kaposi sarcoma    .    - The general health of the patient , especially the patient 's immune system    .
- Whether the cancer has just been diagnosed or has recurred ( come back )    .
Classic Kaposi Sarcoma
Key Points
- Classic Kaposi sarcoma is found most often in older men of Italian or Eastern European Jewish origin    .
- Signs of classic Kaposi sarcoma may include slow - growing lesions on the legs and feet    .
- Another cancer may develop    .
Classic Kaposi sarcoma is found most often in older men of Italian or Eastern European Jewish origin    .
Classic Kaposi sarcoma is a rare disease that gets worse slowly over many years    .
Signs of classic Kaposi sarcoma may include slow - growing lesions on the legs and feet    .
Patients may have one or more red , purple , or brown skin lesions on the legs and feet , most often on the ankles or soles of the feet    .
Over time , lesions may form in other parts of the body , such as the stomach , intestines , or lymph nodes    .
The lesions usually do n't cause any symptoms , but may grow in size and number over a period of 10 years or more    .
Pressure from the lesions may block the flow of lymph and blood in the legs and cause painful swelling    .
Lesions in the digestive tract may cause gastrointestinal bleeding    .
Another cancer may develop    .
Some patients with classic Kaposi sarcoma may develop another type of cancer before the Kaposi sarcoma lesions appear or later in life    .
Most often , this second cancer is non-Hodgkin lymphoma    .
Frequent follow - up is needed to watch for these second cancers    .
Epidemic Kaposi Sarcoma
Key Points
- Epidemic Kaposi sarcoma is found in patients who have acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS )    .
- Signs of epidemic Kaposi sarcoma can include lesions that form in many parts of the body    .
- The use of drug therapy called cART reduces the risk of epidemic Kaposi sarcoma in patients infected with HIV    .
Epidemic Kaposi sarcoma is found in patients who have acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS )    .
Epidemic Kaposi sarcoma occurs in patients who have acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS )    .
AIDS is caused by the human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) , which attacks and weakens the immune system    .
When the body 's immune system is weakened by HIV , infections and cancers such as Kaposi sarcoma can develop    .
Most cases of epidemic Kaposi sarcoma in the United States have been diagnosed in homosexual or bisexual men infected with HIV    .
Signs of epidemic Kaposi sarcoma can include lesions that form in many parts of the body    .
The signs of epidemic Kaposi sarcoma can include lesions in different parts of the body , including any of the following : - Skin   .    - Lining of the mouth    .
- Lymph nodes    .
- Stomach and intestines    .
- Lungs and lining of the chest    .
- Liver    .    - Spleen    .
Kaposi sarcoma is sometimes found in the lining of the mouth during a regular dental check - up    .
In most patients with epidemic Kaposi sarcoma , the disease will spread to other parts of the body over time    .
Fever , weight loss , or diarrhea can occur    .
In the later stages of epidemic Kaposi sarcoma , life - threatening infections are common    .
The use of drug therapy called cART reduces the risk of epidemic Kaposi sarcoma in patients infected with HIV    .
Combined antiretroviral therapy ( cART ) is a combination of several drugs that block HIV and slow down the development of AIDS and AIDS - related Kaposi sarcoma    .
For information about AIDS and its treatment , see the AIDSinfo website    .
Tests that examine the skin , lungs , and gastrointestinal tract are used to detect ( find ) and diagnose Kaposi sarcoma    .
The following tests and procedures may be used : - Physical exam and history :
An exam of the body to check general signs of health , including checking skin and lymph nodes for signs of disease , such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual    .
A history of the patient 's health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken    .
- Chest x-ray :
An x-ray of the organs and bones inside the chest    .
An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film , making a picture of areas inside the body    .
This is used to find Kaposi sarcoma in the lungs    .
- Biopsy :
The removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer    .
One of the following types of biopsies may be done to check for Kaposi sarcoma lesions in the skin : - Excisional biopsy :
A scalpel is used to remove the entire skin growth    .
- Incisional biopsy : A scalpel is used to remove part of a skin growth    .
- Core biopsy :
A wide needle is used to remove part of a skin growth    .
- Fine - needle aspiration ( FNA ) biopsy :
A thin needle is used to remove part of a skin growth    .
An endoscopy or bronchoscopy may be done to check for Kaposi sarcoma lesions in the gastrointestinal tract or lungs    .
- Endoscopy for biopsy : A procedure to look at organs and tissues inside the body to check for abnormal areas    .
An endoscope is inserted through an incision ( cut ) in the skin or opening in the body , such as the mouth    .
An endoscope is a thin , tube - like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing    .
It may also have a tool to remove tissue or lymph node samples , which are checked under a microscope for signs of disease    .
This is used to find Kaposi sarcoma lesions in the gastrointestinal tract    .
- Bronchoscopy for biopsy : A procedure to look inside the trachea and large airways in the lung for abnormal areas    .
A bronchoscope is inserted through the nose or mouth into the trachea and lungs    .
A bronchoscope is a thin , tube - like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing    .
It may also have a tool to remove tissue samples , which are checked under a microscope for signs of disease    .
This is used to find Kaposi sarcoma lesions in the lungs    .
After Kaposi sarcoma has been diagnosed , tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread to other parts of the body    .
The following tests and procedures may be used to find out if cancer has spread to other parts of the body : - Blood chemistry studies :
A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body    .
An unusual ( higher or lower than normal ) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease    .
- CT scan ( CAT scan ) : A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body , such as the lung , liver , and spleen , taken from different angles    .
The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine    .
A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly    .
This procedure is also called computed tomography , computerized tomography , or computerized axial tomography    .
- PET scan ( positron emission tomography scan ) : A procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body    .
A small amount of radioactive glucose ( sugar ) is injected into a vein    .
The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body    .
Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do    .
This imaging test checks for signs of cancer in the lung , liver , and spleen    .
- CD34 lymphocyte count : A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amount of CD34 cells ( a type of white blood cell )    .
A lower than normal amount of CD34 cells can be a sign the immune system is not working well    .
Certain factors affect prognosis ( chance of recovery ) and treatment options    .
The prognosis ( chance of recovery ) and treatment options depend on the following : - The type of Kaposi sarcoma    .    - The general health of the patient , especially the patient 's immune system    .
- Whether the cancer has just been diagnosed or has recurred ( come back )    .

what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Kaposi Sarcoma ?
New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials    .
This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials    .
It may not mention every new treatment being studied    .
Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website    .
Targeted therapy Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells    .
Monoclonal antibody therapy and tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( TKIs ) are types of targeted therapy being studied in the treatment of Kaposi sarcoma    .
Monoclonal antibody therapy is a cancer treatment that uses antibodies made in the laboratory from a single type of immune system cell    .
These antibodies can identify substances on cancer cells or normal substances that may help cancer cells grow    .
The antibodies attach to the substances and kill the cancer cells , block their growth , or keep them from spreading    .
Monoclonal antibodies are given by infusion    .
These may be used alone or to carry drugs , toxins , or radioactive material directly to cancer cells    .
Bevacizumab is a monoclonal antibody that is being studied in the treatment of Kaposi sarcoma    .
TKIs are targeted therapy drugs that block signals needed for tumors to grow    .
Imatinib mesylate is a TKI being studied in the treatment of Kaposi sarcoma    .
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
For some patients , taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice    .
Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process    .
Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment    .
Many of today 's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials    .
Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment    .
Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future    .
Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments , they often answer important questions and help move research forward    .
Patients can enter clinical trials before , during , or after starting their cancer treatment    .
Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment    .
Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better    .
There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring ( coming back ) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment    .
Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country    .
See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials    .

What are the treatments for Kaposi Sarcoma ?
Key Points
- There are different types of treatment for patients with Kaposi sarcoma    .
- Treatment of epidemic Kaposi sarcoma combines treatment for Kaposi sarcoma with treatment for AIDS    .
- Four types of standard treatment are used to treat Kaposi sarcoma : - Radiation therapy - Surgery - Chemotherapy - Biologic therapy - New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials    .
- Targeted therapy - Treatment for Kaposi sarcoma may cause side effects    .
- Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
- Patients can enter clinical trials before , during , or after starting their cancer treatment    .
- Follow - up tests may be needed    .
There are different types of treatment for patients with Kaposi sarcoma    .
Different types of treatments are available for patients with Kaposi sarcoma    .
Some treatments are standard ( the currently used treatment ) , and some are being tested in clinical trials    .
A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer    .
When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment , the new treatment may become the standard treatment    .
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment    .
Treatment of epidemic Kaposi sarcoma combines treatment for Kaposi sarcoma with treatment for AIDS    .
For the treatment of epidemic Kaposi sarcoma , combined antiretroviral therapy ( cART ) is used to slow the progression of AIDS    .
cART may be combined with anticancer drugs and medicines that prevent and treat infections    .
Four types of standard treatment are used to treat Kaposi sarcoma :
Radiation therapy Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high - energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing    .
There are two types of radiation therapy : - External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer    .
- Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles , seeds , wires , or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer    .
The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type of the cancer being treated    .
Certain types of external radiation therapy are used to treat Kaposi sarcoma lesions    .
Photon radiation therapy treats lesions with high - energy light    .
Electron beam radiation therapy uses tiny negatively charged particles called electrons    .
Surgery
The following surgical procedures may be used for Kaposi sarcoma to treat small , surface lesions : - Local excision :
The cancer is cut from the skin along with a small amount of normal tissue around it    .
- Electrodesiccation and curettage :
The tumor is cut from the skin with a curette ( a sharp , spoon - shaped tool )    .
A needle - shaped electrode is then used to treat the area with an electric current that stops the bleeding and destroys cancer cells that remain around the edge of the wound    .
The process may be repeated one to three times during the surgery to remove all of the cancer    .
- Cryosurgery : A treatment that uses an instrument to freeze and destroy abnormal tissue    .
This type of treatment is also called cryotherapy    .
Chemotherapy Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells , either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing    .
When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle , the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body ( systemic chemotherapy )    .
When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid , an organ , tissue , or a body cavity such as the abdomen , the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas ( regional chemotherapy )    .
In electrochemotherapy , intravenous chemotherapy is given and a probe is used to send electric pulses to the tumor    .
The pulses make an opening in the membrane around the tumor cell and allow the chemotherapy to get inside    .
Electrochemotherapy is being studied in the treatment of Kaposi sarcoma    .
The way the chemotherapy is given depends on where the Kaposi sarcoma lesions occur in the body    .
In Kaposi sarcoma , chemotherapy may be given in the following ways : - For local Kaposi sarcoma lesions , such as in the mouth , anticancer drugs may be injected directly into the lesion ( intralesional chemotherapy )    .
- For local lesions on the skin , a topical agent may be applied to the skin as a gel    .
Electrochemotherapy may also be used    .
- For widespread lesions on the skin , intravenous chemotherapy may be given    .
Liposomal chemotherapy uses liposomes ( very tiny fat particles ) to carry anticancer drugs    .
Liposomal doxorubicin is used to treat Kaposi sarcoma    .
The liposomes build up in Kaposi sarcoma tissue more than in healthy tissue , and the doxorubicin is released slowly    .
This increases the effect of the doxorubicin and causes less damage to healthy tissue    .
See Drugs Approved for Kaposi Sarcoma for more information    .
Biologic therapy Biologic therapy is a treatment that uses the patient 's immune system to fight cancer    .
Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost , direct , or restore the body 's natural defenses against cancer    .
This type of cancer treatment is also called biotherapy or immunotherapy    .
Interferon alfa is a biologic agent used to treat Kaposi sarcoma    .
See Drugs Approved for Kaposi Sarcoma for more information    .
Treatment for Kaposi sarcoma may cause side effects    .

Follow - up tests may be needed    .
Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated    .
Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working    .
Decisions about whether to continue , change , or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests    .
Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended    .
The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred ( come back )    .
These tests are sometimes called follow - up tests or check - ups    .

Who is at risk for Childhood Rhabdomyosarcoma? ?
Certain genetic conditions increase the risk of childhood rhabdomyosarcoma    .
Anything that increases the risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor    .
Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer ; not having risk factors doesnt mean that you will not get cancer    .
Talk with your childs doctor if you think your child may be at risk    .
Risk factors for rhabdomyosarcoma include having the following inherited diseases : - Li-Fraumeni syndrome    .    - Pleuropulmonary blastoma    .    - Neurofibromatosis type 1 ( NF1 )    .    - Costello syndrome    .
- Beckwith - Wiedemann syndrome    .    - Noonan syndrome    .
Children who had a high birth weight or were larger than expected at birth may have an increased risk of embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma    .
In most cases , the cause of rhabdomyosarcoma is not known    .
What are the symptoms of Childhood Rhabdomyosarcoma ?
A sign of childhood rhabdomyosarcoma is a lump or swelling that keeps getting bigger    .
Signs and symptoms may be caused by childhood rhabdomyosarcoma or by other conditions    .
The signs and symptoms that occur depend on where the cancer forms    .
Check with your child 's doctor if your child has any of the following : - A lump or swelling that keeps getting bigger or does not go away    .
It may be painful    .
- Bulging of the eye    .    - Headache    .    - Trouble urinating or having bowel movements    .
- Blood in the urine    .
- Bleeding in the nose , throat , vagina , or rectum    .
How to diagnose Childhood Rhabdomyosarcoma ?
Diagnostic tests and a biopsy are used to detect ( find ) and diagnose childhood rhabdomyosarcoma    .
The diagnostic tests that are done depend in part on where the cancer forms    .
The following tests and procedures may be used : - Physical exam and history :
An exam of the body to check general signs of health , including checking for signs of disease , such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual    .
A history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken    .
- X-ray :
An x-ray of the organs and bones inside the body , such as the chest    .
An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film , making a picture of areas inside the body    .
- CT scan ( CAT scan ) : A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body , such as the abdomen , pelvis , or lymph nodes , taken from different angles    .
The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine    .
A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly    .
This procedure is also called computed tomography , computerized tomography , or computerized axial tomography    .
- MRI ( magnetic resonance imaging ) : A procedure that uses a magnet , radio waves , and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas of the body , such as the skull , brain , and lymph nodes    .
This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging ( NMRI )    .
- PET scan ( positron emission tomography scan ) : A procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body    .
A small amount of radioactive glucose ( sugar ) is injected into a vein    .
The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body    .
Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do    .
- Bone scan :
A procedure to check if there are rapidly dividing cells , such as cancer cells , in the bone    .
A very small amount of radioactive material is injected into a vein and travels through the bloodstream    .
The radioactive material collects in the bones with cancer and is detected by a scanner    .
- Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy :
The removal of bone marrow , blood , and a small piece of bone by inserting a hollow needle into the hipbone    .
Samples are removed from both hipbones    .
A pathologist views the bone marrow , blood , and bone under a microscope to look for signs of cancer    .
- Lumbar puncture : A procedure used to collect cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) from the spinal column    .
This is done by placing a needle between two bones in the spine and into the CSF around the spinal cord and removing a sample of the fluid    .
The sample of CSF is checked under a microscope for signs of cancer cells    .
This procedure is also called an LP or spinal tap    .
If these tests show there may be a rhabdomyosarcoma , a biopsy is done    .
A biopsy is the removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer    .
Because treatment depends on the type of rhabdomyosarcoma , biopsy samples should be checked by a pathologist who has experience in diagnosing rhabdomyosarcoma    .
One of the following types of biopsies may be used : - Fine - needle aspiration ( FNA ) biopsy :
The removal of tissue or fluid using a thin needle    .
- Core needle biopsy :
The removal of tissue using a wide needle    .
This procedure may be guided using ultrasound , CT scan , or MRI    .
- Open biopsy :
The removal of tissue through an incision ( cut ) made in the skin    .
- Sentinel lymph node biopsy :
The removal of the sentinel lymph node during surgery    .
The sentinel lymph node is the first lymph node to receive lymphatic drainage from a tumor    .
It is the first lymph node the cancer is likely to spread to from the tumor    .
A radioactive substance and / or blue dye is injected near the tumor    .
The substance or dye flows through the lymph ducts to the lymph nodes    .
The first lymph node to receive the substance or dye is removed    .
A pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells    .
If cancer cells are not found , it may not be necessary to remove more lymph nodes    .
The following tests may be done on the sample of tissue that is removed : - Light microscopy : A laboratory test in which cells in a sample of tissue are viewed under regular and high - powered microscopes to look for certain changes in the cells    .
- Immunohistochemistry :
A test that uses antibodies to check for certain antigens in a sample of tissue    .
The antibody is usually linked to a radioactive substance or a dye that causes the tissue to light up under a microscope    .
This type of test may be used to tell the difference between different types of cancer    .
- FISH ( fluorescence in situ hybridization ) : A laboratory test used to look at genes or chromosomes in cells and tissues    .
Pieces of DNA that contain a fluorescent dye are made in the laboratory and added to cells or tissues on a glass slide    .
When these pieces of DNA attach to certain genes or areas of chromosomes on the slide , they light up when viewed under a microscope with a special light    .
This type of test is used to find certain gene changes    .
- Reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction ( RTPCR ) test : A laboratory test in which cells in a sample of tissue are studied using chemicals to look for certain changes in the structure or function of genes    .
- Cytogenetic analysis :
A laboratory test in which cells in a sample of tissue are viewed under a microscope to look for certain changes in the chromosomes    .
What is the outlook for Childhood Rhabdomyosarcoma ?
Certain factors affect prognosis ( chance of recovery ) and treatment options    .
The prognosis ( chance of recovery ) and treatment options depend on the following : - The patient 's age    .
- Where in the body the tumor started    .
- The size of the tumor at the time of diagnosis    .
- Whether the tumor has been completely removed by surgery    .
- The type of rhabdomyosarcoma ( embryonal , alveolar , or anaplastic )    .
- Whether there are certain changes in the genes    .
- Whether the tumor had spread to other parts of the body at the time of diagnosis    .
- Whether the tumor was in the lymph nodes at the time of diagnosis    .
- Whether the tumor responds to chemotherapy and / or radiation therapy    .
For patients with recurrent cancer , prognosis and treatment also depend on the following : - Where in the body the tumor recurred ( came back )    .
- How much time passed between the end of cancer treatment and when the cancer recurred    .
- Whether the tumor was treated with radiation therapy    .
What are the stages of Childhood Rhabdomyosarcoma ?
Key Points
- After childhood rhabdomyosarcoma has been diagnosed , treatment is based in part on the stage of the cancer and sometimes it is based on whether all the cancer was removed by surgery    .
- There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body    .
- Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body    .
- Staging of childhood rhabdomyosarcoma is done in three parts    .
- The staging system is based on the size of the tumor , where it is in the body , and whether it has spread to other parts of the body : - Stage 1 - Stage 2 - Stage 3 - Stage 4 - The grouping system is based on whether the cancer has spread and whether all the cancer was removed by surgery : - Group I - Group II - Group III - Group IV - The risk group is based on the staging system and the grouping system    .
- Low - risk childhood rhabdomyosarcoma - Intermediate - risk childhood rhabdomyosarcoma - High - risk childhood rhabdomyosarcoma
After childhood rhabdomyosarcoma has been diagnosed , treatment is based in part on the stage of the cancer and sometimes it is based on whether all the cancer was removed by surgery    .
The process used to find out if cancer has spread within the tissue or to other parts of the body is called staging    .
It is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment    .
The doctor will use results of the diagnostic tests to help find out the stage of the disease    .
Treatment for childhood rhabdomyosarcoma is based in part on the stage and sometimes on the amount of cancer that remains after surgery to remove the tumor    .
The pathologist will use a microscope to check the tissues removed during surgery , including tissue samples from the edges of the areas where the cancer was removed and the lymph nodes    .
This is done to see if all the cancer cells were taken out during the surgery    .
There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body    .
Cancer can spread through tissue , the lymph system , and the blood : - Tissue    .
The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas    .
- Lymph system    .
The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system    .
The cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body    .
- Blood    .
The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood    .
The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body    .
Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body    .
When cancer spreads to another part of the body , it is called metastasis    .
Cancer cells break away from where they began ( the primary tumor ) and travel through the lymph system or blood    .
- Lymph system    .
The cancer gets into the lymph system , travels through the lymph vessels , and forms a tumor ( metastatic tumor ) in another part of the body    .
- Blood    .
The cancer gets into the blood , travels through the blood vessels , and forms a tumor ( metastatic tumor ) in another part of the body    .
The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor    .
For example , if rhabdomyosarcoma spreads to the lung , the cancer cells in the lung are actually rhabdomyosarcoma cells    .
The disease is metastatic rhabdomyosarcoma , not lung cancer    .
Staging of childhood rhabdomyosarcoma is done in three parts    .
Childhood rhabdomyosarcoma is staged by using three different ways to describe the cancer : - A staging system    .    - A grouping system    .    - A risk group    .
The staging system is based on the size of the tumor , where it is in the body , and whether it has spread to other parts of the body :
Stage 1
In stage 1 , the tumor is any size , may have spread to lymph nodes , and is found in only one of the following &quot ; favorable &quot ; sites : - Eye or area around the eye    .
- Head and neck ( but not in the tissue next to the brain and spinal cord )    .
- Gallbladder and bile ducts    .
- Ureters or urethra    .    - Testes , ovary , vagina , or uterus    .
Rhabdomyosarcoma that forms in a &quot ; favorable &quot ; site has a better prognosis    .
If the site where cancer occurs is not one of the favorable sites listed above , it is said to be an &quot ; unfavorable &quot ; site    .
Stage 2
In stage 2 , cancer is found in an &quot ; unfavorable &quot ; site ( any one area not described as & quot ; favorable &quot ; in stage 1 )    .
The tumor is no larger than 5 centimeters and has not spread to lymph nodes    .
Stage 3
In stage 3 , cancer is found in an &quot ; unfavorable &quot ; site ( any one area not described as & quot ; favorable &quot ; in stage 1 ) and one of the following is true : - The tumor is no larger than 5 centimeters and cancer has spread to nearby lymph nodes    .
- The tumor is larger than 5 centimeters and cancer may have spread to nearby lymph nodes    .
Stage 4
In stage 4 , the tumor may be any size and cancer may have spread to nearby lymph nodes    .
Cancer has spread to distant parts of the body , such as the lung , bone marrow , or bone    .
The grouping system is based on whether the cancer has spread and whether all the cancer was removed by surgery :
Group I Cancer was found only in the place where it started and it was completely removed by surgery    .
Tissue was taken from the edges of where the tumor was removed    .
The tissue was checked under a microscope by a pathologist and no cancer cells were found    .
Group II Group II is divided into groups IIA , IIB , and IIC    .
- IIA : Cancer was removed by surgery but cancer cells were seen when the tissue , taken from the edges of where the tumor was removed , was viewed under a microscope by a pathologist    .
- IIB : Cancer had spread to nearby lymph nodes and the cancer and lymph nodes were removed by surgery    .
- IIC : Cancer had spread to nearby lymph nodes , the cancer and lymph nodes were removed by surgery , and at least one of the following is true : - Tissue taken from the edges of where the tumor was removed was checked under a microscope by a pathologist and cancer cells were seen    .
- The furthest lymph node from the tumor that was removed was checked under a microscope by a pathologist and cancer cells were seen    .
Group III
Cancer was partly removed by biopsy or surgery but there is tumor remaining that can be seen with the eye    .
Group IV
Cancer had spread to distant parts of the body when the cancer was diagnosed    .
- Cancer cells are found by an imaging test ; or - There are cancer cells in the fluid around the brain , spinal cord , or lungs , or in fluid in the abdomen ; or tumors are found in those areas    .
The risk group is based on the staging system and the grouping system    .
The risk group describes the chance that rhabdomyosarcoma will recur ( come back )    .
Every child treated for rhabdomyosarcoma should receive chemotherapy to decrease the chance cancer will recur    .
The type of anticancer drug , dose , and the number of treatments given depends on whether the child has low - risk , intermediate - risk , or high - risk rhabdomyosarcoma    .
The following risk groups are used : Low - risk childhood rhabdomyosarcoma Low - risk childhood rhabdomyosarcoma is one of the following : - An embryonal tumor of any size that is found in a &quot ; favorable &quot ; site    .
There may be tumor remaining after surgery that can be seen with or without a microscope    .
The cancer may have spread to nearby lymph nodes    .
The following areas are &quot ; favorable &quot ; sites : - Eye or area around the eye    .
- Head or neck ( but not in the tissue near the ear , nose , sinuses , or base of the skull )    .
- Gallbladder and bile ducts    .
- Ureter or urethra    .    - Testes , ovary , vagina , or uterus    .    - An embryonal tumor of any size that is not found in a &quot ; favorable &quot ; site    .
There may be tumor remaining after surgery that can be seen only with a microscope    .
The cancer may have spread to nearby lymph nodes    .
Intermediate - risk childhood rhabdomyosarcoma
Intermediate - risk childhood rhabdomyosarcoma is one of the following : - An embryonal tumor of any size that is not found in one of the &quot ; favorable &quot ; sites listed above    .
There is tumor remaining after surgery , that can be seen with or without a microscope    .
The cancer may have spread to nearby lymph nodes    .
- An alveolar tumor of any size in a &quot ; favorable &quot ; or &quot ; unfavorable &quot ; site    .
There may be tumor remaining after surgery that can be seen with or without a microscope    .
The cancer may have spread to nearby lymph nodes    .
High - risk childhood rhabdomyosarcoma
High - risk childhood rhabdomyosarcoma may be the embryonal type or the alveolar type    .
It may have spread to nearby lymph nodes and has spread to one or more of the following : - Other parts of the body that are not near where the tumor first formed    .
- Fluid around the brain or spinal cord    .
- Fluid in the lung or abdomen    .
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Childhood Rhabdomyosarcoma ?
New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials    .
This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials    .
It may not mention every new treatment being studied    .
Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website    .
High - dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant High - dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant is a way of giving high doses of chemotherapy and replacing blood - forming cells destroyed by the cancer treatment    .
Stem cells ( immature blood cells ) are removed from the blood or bone marrow of the patient or a donor and are frozen and stored    .
After the chemotherapy is completed , the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion    .
These reinfused stem cells grow into ( and restore ) the body 's blood cells    .
Immunotherapy Immunotherapy is a treatment that uses the patients immune system to fight cancer    .
Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost , direct , or restore the bodys natural defenses against cancer    .
This type of cancer treatment is also called biologic therapy or biotherapy    .
There are different types of immunotherapy : - Immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy uses the body 's immune system to kill cancer cells    .
Two types of immune checkpoint inhibitors are being studied in the treatment of childhood rhabdomyosarcoma that has come back after treatment : - CTLA - 4 is a protein on the surface of T cells that helps keep the bodys immune responses in check    .
When CTLA - 4 attaches to another protein called B7 on a cancer cell , it stops the T cell from killing the cancer cell    .
CTLA - 4 inhibitors attach to CTLA - 4 and allow the T cells to kill cancer cells    .
Ipilimumab is a type of CTLA - 4 inhibitor    .
- PD - 1 is a protein on the surface of T cells that helps keep the bodys immune responses in check    .
When PD - 1 attaches to another protein called PDL - 1 on a cancer cell , it stops the T cell from killing the cancer cell    .
PD - 1 inhibitors attach to PDL - 1 and allow the T cells to kill cancer cells    .
Nivolumab and pembrolizumab are PD - 1 inhibitors    .
- Vaccine therapy is a type of immunotherapy being studied to treat metastatic rhabdomyosarcoma    .
Targeted therapy Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to attack cancer cells    .
Targeted therapies usually cause less harm to normal cells than chemotherapy or radiation do    .
There are different types of targeted therapy : - mTOR inhibitors stop the protein that helps cells divide and survive    .
Sirolimus is a type of mTOR inhibitor therapy being studied in the treatment of recurrent rhabdomyosarcoma    .
- Tyrosine kinase inhibitors are small - molecule drugs that go through the cell membrane and work inside cancer cells to block signals that cancer cells need to grow and divide    .
MK - 1775 is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor being studied in the treatment of recurrent rhabdomyosarcoma    .
- Antibody - drug conjugates are made up of a monoclonal antibody attached to a drug    .
The monoclonal antibody binds to specific proteins or receptors found on certain cells , including cancer cells    .
The drug enters these cells and kills them without harming other cells    .
Lorvotuzumab mertansine is an antibody - drug conjugate being studied in the treatment of recurrent rhabdomyosarcoma    .
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
For some patients , taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice    .
Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process    .
Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment    .
Many of today 's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials    .
Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment    .
Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future    .
Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments , they often answer important questions and help move research forward    .
Patients can enter clinical trials before , during , or after starting their cancer treatment    .
Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment    .
Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better    .
There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring ( coming back ) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment    .
Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country    .
See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials    .
These have been retrieved from NCI 's listing of clinical trials    .

There are different types of treatment for patients with childhood rhabdomyosarcoma    .
Some treatments are standard ( the currently used treatment ) , and some are being tested in clinical trials    .
A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer    .
When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment , the new treatment may become the standard treatment    .
Because cancer in children is rare , taking part in a clinical trial should be considered    .
Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment    .
Children with rhabdomyosarcoma should have their treatment planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating cancer in children    .
Because rhabdomyosarcoma can form in many different parts of the body , many different kinds of treatments are used    .
Treatment will be overseen by a pediatric oncologist , a doctor who specializes in treating children with cancer    .
The pediatric oncologist works with other health care providers who are experts in treating children with rhabdomyosarcoma and who specialize in certain areas of medicine    .
These may include the following specialists : - Pediatrician    .    - Pediatric surgeon    .
- Radiation oncologist    .
- Pediatric hematologist    .
- Pediatric radiologist    .
- Pediatric nurse specialist    .
- Geneticist or cancer genetics risk counselor    .
- Social worker    .
- Rehabilitation specialist    .
Treatment for childhood rhabdomyosarcoma may cause side effects    .
For information about side effects that begin during treatment for cancer , see our Side Effects page    .
Side effects from cancer treatment that begin after treatment and continue for months or years are called late effects    .
Late effects of cancer treatment for rhabdomyosarcoma may include : - Physical problems    .
- Changes in mood , feelings , thinking , learning , or memory    .
- Second cancers ( new types of cancer )    .
Some late effects may be treated or controlled    .
It is important to talk with your child 's doctors about the effects cancer treatment can have on your child    .
( See the PDQ summary on Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer for more information    .    )
Three types of standard treatment are used :
Surgery Surgery ( removing the cancer in an operation ) is used to treat childhood rhabdomyosarcoma    .
A type of surgery called wide local excision is often done    .
A wide local excision is the removal of tumor and some of the tissue around it , including the lymph nodes    .
A second surgery may be needed to remove all the cancer    .
Whether surgery is done and the type of surgery done depends on the following : - Where in the body the tumor started    .
- The effect the surgery will have on the way the child will look    .
- The effect the surgery will have on the child 's important body functions    .
- How the tumor responded to chemotherapy or radiation therapy that may have been given first    .
In most children with rhabdomyosarcoma , it is not possible to remove all of the tumor by surgery    .
Rhabdomyosarcoma can form in many different places in the body and the surgery will be different for each site    .
Surgery to treat rhabdomyosarcoma of the eye or genital areas is usually a biopsy    .
Chemotherapy , and sometimes radiation therapy , may be given before surgery to shrink large tumors    .
Even if the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery , patients will be given chemotherapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left    .
Radiation therapy may also be given    .
Treatment given after the surgery to lower the risk that the cancer will come back , is called adjuvant therapy    .
Radiation therapy Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high - energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or stop them from growing    .
There are two types of radiation therapy : - External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer    .
Certain ways of giving radiation therapy can help keep radiation from damaging nearby healthy tissue    .
These types of external radiation therapy include the following : - Conformal radiation therapy : Conformal radiation therapy is a type of external radiation therapy that uses a computer to make a 3 - dimensional ( 3 - D ) picture of the tumor and shapes the radiation beams to fit the tumor    .
This allows a high dose of radiation to reach the tumor and causes less damage to nearby healthy tissue    .
- Intensity - modulated radiation therapy ( IMRT ) : IMRT is a type of 3 - dimensional ( 3 - D ) radiation therapy that uses a computer to make pictures of the size and shape of the tumor    .
Thin beams of radiation of different intensities ( strengths ) are aimed at the tumor from many angles    .
- Volumetrical modulated arc therapy ( VMAT ) : VMAT is type of 3 - D radiation therapy that uses a computer to make pictures of the size and shape of the tumor    .
The radiation machine moves in a circle around the patient once during treatment and sends thin beams of radiation of different intensities ( strengths ) at the tumor    .
Treatment with VMAT is delivered faster than treatment with IMRT    .
- Stereotactic body radiation therapy : Stereotactic body radiation therapy is a type of external radiation therapy    .
Special equipment is used to place the patient in the same position for each radiation treatment    .
Once a day for several days , a radiation machine aims a larger than usual dose of radiation directly at the tumor    .
By having the patient in the same position for each treatment , there is less damage to nearby healthy tissue    .
This procedure is also called stereotactic external - beam radiation therapy and stereotaxic radiation therapy    .
- Proton beam radiation therapy : Proton - beam therapy is a type of high - energy , external radiation therapy    .
A radiation therapy machine aims streams of protons ( tiny , invisible , positively - charged particles ) at the cancer cells to kill them    .
This type of treatment causes less damage to nearby healthy tissue    .
- Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles , seeds , wires , or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer    .
It is used to treat cancer in areas such as the vagina , vulva , uterus , bladder , prostate , head , or neck    .
Internal radiation therapy is also called brachytherapy , internal radiation , implant radiation , or interstitial radiation therapy    .
The type and amount of radiation therapy and when it is given depends on the age of the child , the type of rhabdomyosarcoma , where in the body the tumor started , how much tumor remained after surgery , and whether there is tumor in the nearby lymph nodes    .
External radiation therapy is usually used to treat childhood rhabdomyosarcoma but in certain cases internal radiation therapy is used    .
Chemotherapy Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells , either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing    .
When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle , the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body ( systemic chemotherapy )    .
When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid , an organ , or a body cavity such as the abdomen , the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas ( regional chemotherapy )    .
Chemotherapy may also be given to shrink the tumor before surgery in order to save as much healthy tissue as possible    .
This is called neoadjuvant chemotherapy    .
Every child treated for rhabdomyosarcoma should receive systemic chemotherapy to decrease the chance the cancer will recur    .
The type of anticancer drug , dose , and the number of treatments given depends on whether the child has low - risk , intermediate - risk , or high - risk rhabdomyosarcoma    .
See Drugs Approved for Rhabdomyosarcoma for more information    .
Follow - up tests may be needed    .
Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated    .
Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working    .
Decisions about whether to continue , change , or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests    .
Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended    .
The results of these tests can show if your child 's condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred ( come back )    .
These tests are sometimes called follow - up tests or check - ups    .
Treatment Options for Childhood Rhabdomyosarcoma
Previously Untreated Childhood Rhabdomyosarcoma
The treatment of childhood rhabdomyosarcoma often includes surgery , radiation therapy , and chemotherapy    .
The order that these treatments are given depends on where in the body the tumor started , the size of the tumor , the type of tumor , and whether the tumor has spread to lymph nodes or other parts of the body    .

Targeted therapies usually cause less harm to normal cells than chemotherapy or radiation do    .
There are different types of targeted therapy : - mTOR inhibitors stop the protein that helps cells divide and survive    .
Sirolimus is a type of mTOR inhibitor therapy being studied in the treatment of recurrent rhabdomyosarcoma    .
- Tyrosine kinase inhibitors are small - molecule drugs that go through the cell membrane and work inside cancer cells to block signals that cancer cells need to grow and divide    .
MK - 1775 is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor being studied in the treatment of recurrent rhabdomyosarcoma    .
- Antibody - drug conjugates are made up of a monoclonal antibody attached to a drug    .
The monoclonal antibody binds to specific proteins or receptors found on certain cells , including cancer cells    .
The drug enters these cells and kills them without harming other cells    .
Lorvotuzumab mertansine is an antibody - drug conjugate being studied in the treatment of recurrent rhabdomyosarcoma    .
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
For some patients , taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice    .
Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process    .
Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment    .
Many of today 's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials    .
Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment    .
Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future    .
Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments , they often answer important questions and help move research forward    .
Patients can enter clinical trials before , during , or after starting their cancer treatment    .
Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment    .
Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better    .
There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring ( coming back ) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment    .
Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country    .

- Childhood soft tissue sarcoma is a disease in which malignant ( cancer ) cells form in soft tissues of the body    .
- Soft tissue sarcoma occurs in children and adults    .
- Having certain diseases and inherited disorders can increase the risk of childhood soft tissue sarcoma    .    - The most common sign of childhood soft tissue sarcoma is a painless lump or swelling in soft tissues of the body    .
- Diagnostic tests are used to detect ( find ) and diagnose childhood soft tissue sarcoma    .    - If tests show there may be a soft tissue sarcoma , a biopsy is done    .
- There are many different types of soft tissue sarcomas    .
- Fat tissue tumors - Bone and cartilage tumors - Fibrous ( connective ) tissue tumors - Skeletal muscle tumors - Smooth muscle tumors - So - called fibrohistiocytic tumors - Peripheral nervous system tumors - Pericytic ( Perivascular ) Tumors - Tumors of unknown origin - Blood vessel tumors - Certain factors affect prognosis ( chance of recovery ) and treatment options    .
Childhood soft tissue sarcoma is a disease in which malignant ( cancer ) cells form in soft tissues of the body    .
Soft tissues of the body connect , support , and surround other body parts and organs    .
The soft tissues include the following : - Fat   .    - A mix of bone and cartilage    .
- Fibrous tissue    .
- Muscles    .    - Nerves    .    - Tendons ( bands of tissue that connect muscles to bones )    .
- Synovial tissues ( tissues around joints )    .
- Blood vessels    .
- Lymph vessels    .
Soft tissue sarcoma may be found anywhere in the body    .
In children , the tumors form most often in the arms , legs , or trunk ( chest and abdomen )    .
Soft tissue sarcoma occurs in children and adults    .
Soft tissue sarcoma in children may respond differently to treatment , and may have a better prognosis than soft tissue sarcoma in adults    .
( See the PDQ summary on Adult Soft Tissue Sarcoma Treatment for information on treatment in adults    .    )
There are many different types of soft tissue sarcomas    .
The cells of each type of sarcoma look different under a microscope    .
The soft tissue tumors are grouped based on the type of soft tissue cell where they first formed    .
This summary is about the following types of soft tissue sarcoma :
Fat tissue tumors - Liposarcoma    .
This is a rare cancer of the fat cells    .
Liposarcoma usually forms in the fat layer just under the skin    .
In children and adolescents , liposarcoma is often low grade ( likely to grow and spread slowly )    .
There are several different types of liposarcoma    .
Myxoid liposarcoma is usually low grade and responds well to treatment    .
The cells of myxoid liposarcoma have a certain genetic change called a translocation ( part of one chromosome switches places with part of another chromosome )    .
In order to diagnose myxoid liposarcoma , the tumor cells are checked for this genetic change    .
Pleomorphic liposarcoma is usually high grade ( likely to grow and spread quickly ) and is less likely to respond well to treatment    .
Bone and cartilage tumors
Bone and cartilage tumors are a mix of bone cells and cartilage cells    .
Bone and cartilage tumors include the following types : - Extraskeletal mesenchymal chondrosarcoma    .
This type of bone and cartilage tumor often affects young adults and occurs in the head and neck    .
- Extraskeletal osteosarcoma    .
This type of bone and cartilage tumor is very rare in children and adolescents    .
It is likely to come back after treatment and may spread to the lungs    .
Fibrous ( connective ) tissue tumors Fibrous ( connective ) tissue tumors include the following types : - Desmoid - type fibromatosis ( also called desmoid tumor or aggressive fibromatosis )    .
This fibrous tissue tumor is low grade ( likely to grow slowly )    .
It may come back in nearby tissues but usually does not spread to distant parts of the body    .
Rarely , the tumor may disappear without treatment    .
Desmoid tumors sometimes occur in children with changes in the adenomatous polyposis coli ( APC ) gene    .
Changes in this gene cause familial adenomatous polyposis ( FAP )    .
FAP is an inherited condition in which many polyps ( growths on mucous membranes ) form on the inside walls of the colon and rectum    .
Genetic counseling ( a discussion with a trained professional about inherited diseases and a possible need for gene testing ) may be needed    .
- Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans    .
This is a rare tumor of the deep layers of the skin found in children and adults    .
The cells of this tumor have a certain genetic change called a translocation ( part of one chromosome switches places with part of another chromosome )    .
In order to diagnose dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans , the tumor cells are checked for this genetic change    .
- Fibrosarcoma    .
There are two types of fibrosarcoma in children and adolescents : - Infantile fibrosarcoma ( also called congenital fibrosarcoma )    .
This type of fibrosarcoma is found in children aged 4 years and younger    .
It most often occurs in infants and may be seen in a prenatal ultrasound exam    .
This tumor is often large and fast growing , but rarely spreads to distant parts of the body    .
The cells of this tumor usually have a certain genetic change called a translocation ( part of one chromosome switches places with part of another chromosome )    .
In order to diagnose infantile fibrosarcoma , the tumor cells are checked for this genetic change    .
- Adult - type fibrosarcoma    .
This is the same type of fibrosarcoma found in adults    .
The cells of this tumor do not have the genetic change found in infantile fibrosarcoma    .
See the PDQ summary on Adult Soft Tissue Sarcoma Treatment for more information    .
- Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor    .

A certain genetic change has been found in about half of these tumors    .
- Low - grade fibromyxoid sarcoma    .
This is a slow - growing tumor that affects young and middle - aged adults    .
The cells of this tumor usually have a certain genetic change called a translocation ( part of one chromosome switches places with part of another chromosome )    .
In order to diagnose low - grade fibromyxoid sarcoma , the tumor cells are checked for this genetic change    .
The tumor may come back many years after treatment and spread to the lungs and the lining of the wall of the chest cavity    .
Lifelong follow - up is needed    .
- Myxofibrosarcoma    .
This is a rare fibrous tissue tumor that is found less often in children than in adults    .
- Sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma    .
This is a rare fibrous tissue tumor that can come back and spread to other places years after treatment    .
Long - term follow - up is needed    .
Skeletal muscle tumors Skeletal muscle is attached to bones and helps the body move    .
- Rhabdomyosarcoma    .
Rhabdomyosarcoma is the most common childhood soft tissue sarcoma in children 14 years and younger    .
See the PDQ summary on Childhood Rhabdomyosarcoma Treatment for more information    .
Smooth muscle tumors Smooth muscle lines the inside of blood vessels and hollow internal organs such as the stomach , intestines , bladder , and uterus    .
- Leiomyosarcoma    .
This smooth muscle tumor has been linked with Epstein - Barr virus in children who also have HIV disease or AIDS    .
Leiomyosarcoma may also form as a second cancer in survivors of inherited retinoblastoma , sometimes many years after the initial treatment for retinoblastoma    .
So - called fibrohistiocytic tumors - Plexiform fibrohistiocytic tumor    .
This is a rare tumor that usually affects children and young adults    .
The tumor usually starts as a painless growth on or just under the skin on the arm , hand , or wrist    .
It may rarely spread to nearby lymph nodes or to the lungs    .
Peripheral nervous system tumors Peripheral nervous system tumors include the following types : - Ectomesenchymoma    .

Ectomesenchymomas may form in the head and neck , abdomen , perineum , scrotum , arms , or legs    .
- Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor    .
This is a tumor that forms in the nerve sheath    .
Some children who have a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor have a rare genetic condition called neurofibromatosis type 1 ( NF1 )    .
This tumor may be low grade or high grade    .
- Malignant triton tumor    .
These are very rare , fast - growing tumors that occur most often in children with NF1    .
Pericytic ( Perivascular ) Tumors Pericytic tumors form in cells that wrap around blood vessels    .
Pericytic tumors include the following types : - Myopericytoma    .
Infantile hemangiopericytoma is a type of myopericytoma    .
Children younger than 1 year at the time of diagnosis may have a better prognosis    .
In patients older than 1 year , infantile hemangiopericytoma is more likely to spread to other parts of the body , including the lymph nodes and lungs    .
- Infantile myofibromatosis    .
Infantile myofibromatosis is another type of myopericytoma    .
It is a fibrous tumor that often forms in the first 2 years of life    .
There may be one nodule under the skin , usually in the head and neck area ( myofibroma ) , or nodules in several skin areas , muscle , and bone ( myofibromatosis )    .
These tumors may go away without treatment    .
Tumors of unknown origin Tumors of unknown origin ( the place where the tumor first formed is not known ) include the following types : - Alveolar soft part sarcoma    .
This is a rare tumor of the soft supporting tissue that connects and surrounds the organs and other tissues    .
It is most commonly found in the limbs but can occur in the tissues of the mouth , jaws , and face    .
It may grow slowly and may have spread to other parts of the body at the time of diagnosis    .
Alveolar soft part sarcoma may have a better prognosis when the tumor is 5 centimeters or smaller or when the tumor is completely removed by surgery    .
The cells of this tumor usually have a certain genetic change called a translocation ( part of one chromosome switches places with part of another chromosome )    .
In order to diagnose alveolar soft part sarcoma , the tumor cells are checked for this genetic change    .
- Clear cell sarcoma of soft tissue    .
This is a slow - growing soft tissue tumor that begins in a tendon ( tough , fibrous , cord - like tissue that connects muscle to bone or to another part of the body )    .
Clear cell sarcoma most commonly occurs in deep tissue of the foot , heel , and ankle    .
It may spread to nearby lymph nodes    .
The cells of this tumor usually have a certain genetic change called a translocation ( part of one chromosome switches places with part of another chromosome )    .
In order to diagnose clear cell sarcoma of soft tissue , the tumor cells are checked for this genetic change    .

Desmoplastic small round cell tumor may also spread to the lungs and other parts of the body    .
The cells of this tumor usually have a certain genetic change called a translocation ( part of one chromosome switches places with part of another chromosome )    .
In order to diagnose desmoplastic small round cell tumor , the tumor cells are checked for this genetic change    .
- Epithelioid sarcoma    .
This is a rare sarcoma that usually starts deep in soft tissue as a slow growing , firm lump and may spread to the lymph nodes    .
- Extrarenal ( extracranial ) rhabdoid tumor    .
This is a rare , fast - growing tumor of soft tissues such as the liver and peritoneum    .
It usually occurs in young children , including newborns , but it can occur in older children and adults    .
Rhabdoid tumors may be linked to a change in a tumor suppressor gene called SMARCB1    .
This type of gene makes a protein that helps control cell growth    .
Changes in the SMARCB1 gene may be inherited ( passed on from parents to offspring )    .
Genetic counseling ( a discussion with a trained professional about inherited diseases and a possible need for gene testing ) may be needed    .
- Extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma    .
This is a rare soft tissue sarcoma that may be found in children and adolescents    .
Over time , it tends to spread to other parts of the body , including the lymph nodes and lungs    .
The cells of this tumor usually have a genetic change , often a translocation ( part of one chromosome switches places with part of another chromosome )    .
In order to diagnose extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma , the tumor cells are checked for this genetic change    .
The tumor may come back many years after treatment    .

- Synovial sarcoma    .
Synovial sarcoma is a common type of soft tissue sarcoma in children and adolescents    .
Synovial sarcoma usually forms in the tissues around the joints in the arms or legs , but may also form in the trunk , head , or neck    .
The cells of this tumor usually have a certain genetic change called a translocation ( part of one chromosome switches places with part of another chromosome )    .
Larger tumors have a greater risk of spreading to other parts of the body , including the lungs    .
Children younger than 10 years and those whose tumor is 5 centimeters or smaller have a better prognosis    .
- Undifferentiated / unclassified sarcoma    .
These tumors usually occur in the muscles that are attached to bones and that help the body move    .
- Undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma / malignant fibrous histiocytoma ( high - grade )    .
This type of soft tissue tumor may form in parts of the body where patients have received radiation therapy in the past , or as a second cancer in children with retinoblastoma    .
The tumor is usually found on the arms or legs and may spread to other parts of the body    .
See the PDQ summary on Osteosarcoma and Malignant Fibrous Histiocytoma of Bone Treatment for information about malignant fibrous histiocytoma of bone    .
Blood vessel tumors Blood vessel tumors include the following types : - Angiosarcoma of the soft tissue    .
Angiosarcoma of the soft tissue is a fast - growing tumor that forms in blood vessels or lymph vessels in any part of the body    .
Most angiosarcomas are in or just under the skin    .
Those in deeper soft tissue can form in the liver , spleen , and lung    .
They are very rare in children , who sometimes have more than one tumor in the skin or liver    .
Rarely , infantile hemangioma may become angiosarcoma of the soft tissue    .
( See the PDQ summary on Childhood Vascular Tumors Treatment for more information    .    ) - Epithelioid hemangioendothelioma    .
Epithelioid hemangioendotheliomas can occur in children , but are most common in adults between 30 and 50 years of age    .
They usually occur in the liver , lung , or bone    .
They may be either fast growing or slow growing    .
In about a third of cases , the tumor spreads to other parts of the body very quickly    .
( See the PDQ summary on Childhood Vascular Tumors Treatment for more information    .    )
See the following PDQ summaries for information about types of soft tissue sarcoma not included in this summary : - Childhood Rhabdomyosarcoma Treatment    .    - Ewing Sarcoma Treatment    .
- Unusual Cancers of Childhood Treatment ( gastrointestinal stromal tumors )    .
Who is at risk for Childhood Soft Tissue Sarcoma? ?
Having certain diseases and inherited disorders can increase the risk of childhood soft tissue sarcoma    .
Anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor    .
Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer ; not having risk factors doesnt mean that you will not get cancer    .
Talk with your childs doctor if you think your child may be at risk    .
Risk factors for childhood soft tissue sarcoma include having the following inherited disorders : - Li-Fraumeni syndrome    .
- Familial adenomatous polyposis ( FAP )    .
- Retinoblastoma 1 gene changes    .
- Neurofibromatosis type 1 ( NF1 )    .    - Werner syndrome    .
Other risk factors include the following : - Past treatment with radiation therapy    .
- Having AIDS ( acquired immune deficiency syndrome ) and Epstein - Barr virus infection at the same time    .
What are the symptoms of Childhood Soft Tissue Sarcoma ?
The most common sign of childhood soft tissue sarcoma is a painless lump or swelling in soft tissues of the body    .
A sarcoma may appear as a painless lump under the skin , often on an arm , a leg , or the trunk    .
There may be no other signs or symptoms at first    .
As the sarcoma gets bigger and presses on nearby organs , nerves , muscles , or blood vessels , it may cause signs or symptoms , such as pain or weakness    .
Other conditions may cause the same signs and symptoms    .
Check with your childs doctor if your child has any of these problems    .
How to diagnose Childhood Soft Tissue Sarcoma ?
Diagnostic tests are used to detect ( find ) and diagnose childhood soft tissue sarcoma    .
The following tests and procedures may be used : - Physical exam and history :
An exam of the body to check general signs of health , including checking for signs of disease , such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual    .
A history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken    .
- X-rays :
An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body onto film , making pictures of areas inside the body    .
- MRI ( magnetic resonance imaging ) : A procedure that uses a magnet , radio waves , and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas of the body , such as the chest , abdomen , arms , or legs    .
This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging ( NMRI )    .
- CT scan ( CAT scan ) : A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body , such as the chest or abdomen , taken from different angles    .
The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine    .
A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly    .
This procedure is also called computed tomography , computerized tomography , or computerized axial tomography    .
- Ultrasound exam :
A procedure in which high - energy sound waves ( ultrasound ) are bounced off internal tissues or organs and make echoes    .
The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram    .
The picture can be printed to be looked at later    .
- If tests show there may be a soft tissue sarcoma , a biopsy is done    .
One of the following types of biopsies is usually used : - Core needle biopsy :
The removal of tissue using a wide needle    .
This procedure may be guided using ultrasound , CT scan , or MRI    .
- Incisional biopsy :
The removal of part of a lump or a sample of tissue    .
- Excisional biopsy :
The removal of an entire lump or area of tissue that doesnt look normal    .
A pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells    .
An excisional biopsy may be used to completely remove smaller tumors that are near the surface of the skin    .
This type of biopsy is rarely used because cancer cells may remain after the biopsy    .
If cancer cells remain , the cancer may come back or it may spread to other parts of the body    .
An MRI of the tumor is done before the excisional biopsy    .
This is done to show where the original tumor is and may be used to guide future surgery or radiation therapy    .
The placement of needles or incisions for the biopsy can affect the success of later surgery to remove the tumor    .
If possible , the surgeon who will remove any tumor that is found should be involved in planning the biopsy    .
In order to plan the best treatment , the sample of tissue removed during the biopsy must be large enough to find out the type of soft tissue sarcoma and do other laboratory tests    .
Tissue samples will be taken from the primary tumor , lymph nodes , and other areas that may have cancer cells    .
A pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells and to find out the type and grade of the tumor    .
The grade of a tumor depends on how abnormal the cancer cells look under a microscope and how quickly the cells are dividing    .
High - grade and mid-grade tumors usually grow and spread more quickly than low - grade tumors    .
Because soft tissue sarcoma can be hard to diagnose , the tissue sample should be checked by a pathologist who has experience in diagnosing soft tissue sarcoma    .
One or more of the following laboratory tests may be done to study the tissue samples : - Molecular test :
A laboratory test to check for certain genes , proteins , or other molecules in a sample of tissue , blood , or other body fluid    .
A molecular test may be done with other procedures , such as biopsies , to help diagnose some types of cancer    .
Molecular tests check for certain gene or chromosome changes that occur in some soft tissue sarcomas    .
- Reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction ( RTPCR ) test : A laboratory test in which cells in a sample of tissue are studied using chemicals to look for changes in the expression of certain genes    .
When genes are expressed they make specific proteins that are needed for the structure , function , and monitoring of the bodys tissues and organs    .
This test is done in order to identify the type of tumor    .
- Cytogenetic analysis :
A laboratory test in which cells in a sample of bone marrow , blood , amniotic fluid , tumor or other tissue is viewed under a microscope to look for changes in the chromosomes    .
Fluorescence in situ hybridization ( FISH ) is a type of cytogenetic analysis    .
- Immunocytochemistry :
A test that uses antibodies to check for certain antigens ( markers ) in a sample of cells    .
The antibody is usually linked to an enzyme or fluorescent dye that causes the cells that have that marker to become visible under a microscope    .
This type of test may be used to tell the difference between different types of soft tissue sarcoma    .
What is the outlook for Childhood Soft Tissue Sarcoma ?
Certain factors affect prognosis ( chance of recovery ) and treatment options    .
The prognosis ( chance of recovery ) and treatment options depend on the following : - The part of the body where the tumor first formed    .
- The size and grade of the tumor    .    - The type of soft tissue sarcoma    .    - How deep the tumor is under the skin    .
- Whether the tumor has spread to other places in the body    .
- The amount of tumor remaining after surgery to remove it    .
- Whether radiation therapy was used to treat the tumor    .
- The age and gender of the patient    .
- Whether the cancer has just been diagnosed or has recurred ( come back )    .
What are the stages of Childhood Soft Tissue Sarcoma ?
Key Points
- After childhood soft tissue sarcoma has been diagnosed , tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread to other parts of the body    .
- There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body    .
- Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body    .
After childhood soft tissue sarcoma has been diagnosed , tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread to other parts of the body    .
The process used to find out if cancer has spread within the soft tissue or to other parts of the body is called staging    .
There is no standard staging system for childhood soft tissue sarcoma    .
In order to plan treatment , it is important to know the type of soft tissue sarcoma , whether the tumor can be removed by surgery , and whether cancer has spread to other parts of the body    .
The following procedures may be used to find out if cancer has spread : - Sentinel lymph node biopsy : A sentinel lymph node biopsy is done to check if cancer has spread to the lymph nodes    .
The sentinel lymph node is the first lymph node to receive lymphatic drainage from a tumor    .
It is the first lymph node the cancer is likely to spread to from the tumor    .
A small amount of a radioactive substance and / or blue dye is injected near the tumor    .
The radioactive substance or dye flows through the lymph ducts to the lymph nodes    .
The first lymph node to receive the substance or dye is removed    .
A pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells    .
If cancer cells are not found , it may not be necessary to remove more lymph nodes    .
This procedure is used for epithelioid and clear cell sarcoma    .
- PET scan : A PET scan is a procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body    .
A small amount of radioactive glucose ( sugar ) is injected into a vein    .
The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body    .
Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do    .
This procedure is also called positron emission tomography ( PET ) scan    .
- PET -CT scan :
A procedure that combines the pictures from a PET scan and a computed tomography ( CT ) scan    .
The PET and CT scans are done at the same time on the same machine    .
The pictures from both scans are combined to make a more detailed picture than either test would make by itself    .
There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body    .
Cancer can spread through tissue , the lymph system , and the blood : - Tissue    .
The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas    .
- Lymph system    .
The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system    .
The cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body    .
- Blood    .
The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood    .
The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body    .
Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body    .
When cancer spreads to another part of the body , it is called metastasis    .
Cancer cells break away from where they began ( the primary tumor ) and travel through the lymph system or blood    .
- Lymph system    .
The cancer gets into the lymph system , travels through the lymph vessels , and forms a tumor ( metastatic tumor ) in another part of the body    .
- Blood    .
The cancer gets into the blood , travels through the blood vessels , and forms a tumor ( metastatic tumor ) in another part of the body    .
The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor    .
For example , if soft tissue sarcoma spreads to the lung , the cancer cells in the lung are soft tissue sarcoma cells    .
The disease is metastatic soft tissue sarcoma , not lung cancer    .
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Childhood Soft Tissue Sarcoma ?
New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials    .
This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials    .
It may not mention every new treatment being studied    .
Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website    .
Gene therapy
Some of the patient 's T cells ( a type of white blood cell ) are removed and the genes in the cells are changed in a laboratory ( genetically engineered ) so that they will attack specific cancer cells    .
They are then given back to the patient by infusion    .
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
For some patients , taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice    .
Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process    .
Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment    .
Many of today 's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials    .
Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment    .
Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future    .
Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments , they often answer important questions and help move research forward    .
Patients can enter clinical trials before , during , or after starting their cancer treatment    .
Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment    .
Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better    .
There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring ( coming back ) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment    .
Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country    .
See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials    .
These have been retrieved from NCI 's listing of clinical trials    .

- Patients can enter clinical trials before , during , or after starting their cancer treatment    .
- Follow - up tests may be needed    .
There are different types of treatment for patients with childhood soft tissue sarcoma    .
Different types of treatments are available for patients with childhood soft tissue sarcoma    .
Some treatments are standard ( the currently used treatment ) , and some are being tested in clinical trials    .
A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer    .
When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment , the new treatment may become the standard treatment    .
Because cancer in children is rare , taking part in a clinical trial should be considered    .
Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment    .
Children with childhood soft tissue sarcoma should have their treatment planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating cancer in children    .
Treatment will be overseen by a pediatric oncologist , a doctor who specializes in treating children with cancer    .
The pediatric oncologist works with other health care providers who are experts in treating children with soft tissue sarcoma and who specialize in certain areas of medicine    .
These may include a pediatric surgeon with special training in the removal of soft tissue sarcomas    .
The following specialists may also be included : - Pediatrician    .    - Radiation oncologist    .
- Pediatric hematologist    .
- Pediatric nurse specialist    .
- Rehabilitation specialist    .
- Psychologist    .
- Social worker    .
- Child - life specialist    .
Treatment for childhood soft tissue sarcoma may cause side effects    .
For information about side effects that begin during treatment for cancer , see our Side Effects page    .
Side effects from cancer treatment that begin after treatment and continue for months or years are called late effects    .
Late effects of cancer treatment may include : - Physical problems    .
- Changes in mood , feelings , thinking , learning , or memory    .
- Second cancers ( new types of cancer )    .
Some late effects may be treated or controlled    .
It is important to talk with your child 's doctors about the effects cancer treatment can have on your child    .
( See the PDQ summary on Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer for more information    .    )
Eight types of standard treatment are used :
Surgery Surgery to completely remove the soft tissue sarcoma is done when possible    .
If the tumor is very large , radiation therapy or chemotherapy may be given first , to make the tumor smaller and decrease the amount of tissue that needs to be removed during surgery    .
This is called neoadjuvant therapy    .
The following types of surgery may be used : - Wide local excision : Removal of the tumor along with some normal tissue around it    .
- Amputation : Surgery to remove all or part of the limb or appendage with cancer , such as the arm or hand    .
- Lymphadenectomy : Removal of the lymph nodes with cancer    .    - Mohs surgery : A surgical procedure used to treat cancer in the skin    .
Individual layers of cancer tissue are removed and checked under a microscope one at a time until all cancer tissue has been removed    .
This type of surgery is used to treat dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans    .
It is also called Mohs micrographic surgery    .
- Hepatectomy : Surgery to remove all or part of the liver    .
A second surgery may be needed to : - Remove any remaining cancer cells    .
- Check the area around where the tumor was removed for cancer cells and then remove more tissue if needed    .
If cancer is in the liver , a hepatectomy and liver transplant may be done ( the liver is removed and replaced with a healthy one from a donor )    .
Even if the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery , some patients may be given radiation therapy or chemotherapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left    .
Treatment given after the surgery , to lower the risk that the cancer will come back , is called adjuvant therapy    .
Radiation therapy Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high - energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing    .
There are two types of radiation therapy : - External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer    .
Certain ways of giving radiation therapy can help keep radiation from damaging nearby healthy tissue    .
This type of radiation therapy may include the following : - Stereotactic body radiation therapy : Stereotactic body radiation therapy is a type of external radiation therapy    .
Special equipment is used to place the patient in the same position for each radiation treatment    .
Once a day for several days , a radiation machine aims a larger than usual dose of radiation directly at the tumor    .
By having the patient in the same position for each treatment , there is less damage to nearby healthy tissue    .
This procedure is also called stereotactic external - beam radiation therapy and stereotaxic radiation therapy    .
- Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles , seeds , wires , or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer    .
The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated and whether the tumor was completely removed by surgery    .
External and internal radiation therapy are used to treat childhood soft tissue sarcoma    .
Chemotherapy Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells , either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing    .
When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle , the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body ( systemic chemotherapy )    .
When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid , an organ , or a body cavity such as the abdomen , the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas ( regional chemotherapy )    .
Combination chemotherapy is the use of more than one anticancer drug    .
The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type of cancer being treated    .
Most types of soft tissue sarcoma do not respond to treatment with chemotherapy    .
See Drugs Approved for Soft Tissue Sarcoma for more information    .
Observation Observation is closely monitoring a patients condition without giving any treatment until signs or symptoms appear or change    .
Observation may be done when : - Complete removal of the tumor is not possible    .
- No other treatments are available    .
- The tumor is not likely to damage any vital organs    .
Hormone therapy Hormone therapy is a cancer treatment that removes hormones or blocks their action and stops cancer cells from growing    .
Hormones are substances made by glands in the body and circulated in the bloodstream    .
Some hormones can cause certain cancers to grow    .
If tests show that the cancer cells have places where hormones can attach ( receptors ) , drugs , surgery , or radiation therapy is used to reduce the production of hormones or block them from working    .
Antiestrogens ( drugs that block estrogen ) , such as tamoxifen , may be used to treat desmoid - type fibromatosis    .
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) are drugs ( such as aspirin , ibuprofen , and naproxen ) that are commonly used to decrease fever , swelling , pain , and redness    .
In the treatment of desmoid - type fibromatosis , an NSAID called sulindac may be used to help block the growth of cancer cells    .
Targeted therapy Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to attack cancer cells    .
Targeted therapies usually cause less harm to normal cells than chemotherapy or radiation do    .
Kinase inhibitors are a type of targeted therapy that block an enzyme called kinase ( a type of protein )    .
There are different types of kinases in the body that have different actions    .
- ALK inhibitors may stop the cancer from growing and spreading : - Crizotinib may be used to treat inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor    .
- Tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( TKIs ) block signals needed for tumors to grow : - Imatinib is used to treat dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans    .
- Pazopanib may be used to treat recurrent and progressive soft tissue sarcoma    .
It is being studied for many types of newly diagnosed soft tissue sarcoma    .
- Sorafenib may be used to treat desmoid - type fibromatosis    .
New types of tyrosine kinase inhibitors are being studied such as LOXO - 101 and entrectinib for infantile fibrosarcoma    .
Other types of targeted therapy are being studied in clinical trials , including the following : - mTOR inhibitors are a type of targeted therapy that stops the protein that helps cells divide and survive    .
mTOR inhibitors are being studied to treat perivascular epithelioid cell tumors ( PEComas ) and epithelioid hemangioendothelioma    .
Sirolimus is a type of mTOR inhibitor therapy    .
- Angiogenesis inhibitors are a type of targeted therapy that prevent the growth of new blood vessels needed for tumors to grow    .
Angiogenesis inhibitors , such as cediranib , sunitinib , and thalidomide are being studied to treat alveolar soft part sarcoma and epithelioid hemangioendothelioma    .
Bevacizumab is being studied for blood vessel tumors    .
- Histone methyltransferase ( HMT ) inhibitors are targeted therapy drugs that work inside cancer cells and block signals needed for tumors to grow    .
HMT inhibitors are being studied for the treatment of epithelioid sarcoma , malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor , extrarenal ( extracranial ) rhabdoid tumor , extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma , and synovial sarcoma    .
- Heat - shock protein inhibitors block certain proteins that protect tumor cells and help them grow    .
Ganetespib is a heat shock protein inhibitor being studied in combination with the mTOR inhibitor sirolimus for malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors that cannot be removed by surgery    .
- Antibody - drug conjugates are made up of a monoclonal antibody attached to a drug    .
The monoclonal antibody binds to specific proteins or receptors found on certain cells , including cancer cells    .
The drug enters these cells and kills them without harming other cells    .
Lorvotuzumab mertansine is an antibody - drug conjugate being studied for the treatment of rhabdomyosarcoma , malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor , and synovial sarcoma    .
See Drugs Approved for Soft Tissue Sarcoma for more information    .
Immunotherapy Immunotherapy is a treatment that uses the patients immune system to fight disease    .
Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost , direct , or restore the bodys natural defenses against disease    .
Interferon is a type of immunotherapy used to treat epithelioid hemangioendothelioma    .
It interferes with the division of tumor cells and can slow tumor growth    .
Follow - up tests may be needed    .
Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated    .
Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working    .
Decisions about whether to continue , change , or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests    .
Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended    .
The results of these tests can show if your child 's condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred ( come back )    .
These tests are sometimes called follow - up tests or check - ups    .

What is (are) Childhood Vascular Tumors ?
Key Points
- Childhood vascular tumors form from cells that make blood vessels or lymph vessels    .
- Tests are used to detect ( find ) and diagnose childhood vascular tumors    .
- Childhood vascular tumors may be classified into four groups    .
- Benign tumors - Intermediate ( locally aggressive ) tumors - Intermediate ( rarely metastasizing ) tumors - Malignant tumors
Childhood vascular tumors form from cells that make blood vessels or lymph vessels    .
Vascular tumors can form from abnormal blood vessel or lymph vessel cells anywhere in the body    .
They may be benign ( not cancer ) or malignant ( cancer )    .
There are many types of vascular tumors    .
The most common type of childhood vascular tumor is hemangioma , which is a benign tumor that usually goes away on its own    .
Because malignant vascular tumors are rare in children , there is not a lot of information about what treatment works best    .
Childhood vascular tumors may be classified into four groups    .
Benign tumors Benign tumors are not cancer    .
This summary has information about the following benign vascular tumors : - Infantile hemangioma    .    - Congenital hemangioma    .    - Benign vascular tumors of the liver    .
- Spindle cell hemangioma    .    - Epithelioid hemangioma    .    - Pyogenic granuloma ( lobular capillary hemangioma )    .
- Angiofibroma    .    - Juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma    .
Intermediate ( locally aggressive ) tumors Intermediate tumors that are locally aggressive often spread to the area around the tumor    .
This summary has information about the following locally aggressive vascular tumors : - Kaposiform hemangioendothelioma and tufted angioma    .
Intermediate ( rarely metastasizing ) tumors Intermediate ( rarely metastasizing ) tumors sometimes spread to other parts of the body    .
This summary has information about the following vascular tumors that rarely metastasize : - Retiform hemangioendothelioma    .    - Papillary intralymphatic angioendothelioma    .
- Composite hemangioendothelioma    .    - Kaposi sarcoma    .
Malignant tumors Malignant tumors are cancer    .
This summary has information about the following malignant vascular tumors : - Epithelioid hemangioendothelioma    .    - Angiosarcoma of soft tissue    .
Benign Tumors
Infantile Hemangioma
Infantile hemangiomas are the most common type of benign vascular tumor in children    .
An infantile hemangioma may also be called a &quot ; strawberry mark    .
&quot ; Immature cells that are meant to form blood vessels form a tumor instead    .
These tumors are not usually seen at birth but appear when the infant is 3 to 6 weeks old    .
Most hemangiomas get bigger for about 5 months , then stop growing and slowly fade away completely during the next several years    .
It is rare for them to come back    .
Hemangiomas may be on the skin , in the tissue below the skin , and / or in an organ    .
They are usually on the head and neck but can be anywhere on or in the body    .
Hemangiomas may appear as a single lesion , one or more lesions spread over a larger area of the body , or multiple lesions in more than one part of the body    .
Lesions that are spread over a larger area of the body or multiple lesions are more likely to cause problems    .
Risk Factors
Anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor    .
Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get the disease ; not having risk factors doesnt mean that you will not get the disease    .
Talk with your child 's doctor if you think your child may be at risk    .
Infantile hemangiomas are more common in the following : - Girls    .    - Whites    .    - Premature babies    .    - Twins , triplets , or other multiple births    .
- Babies of mothers who are older at time of the pregnancy or who have problems with the placenta during pregnancy    .
Other risk factors for infantile hemangiomas include the following : - Having certain syndromes    .
- PHACE syndrome : A syndrome in which the hemangioma spreads across a large area of the body ( usually the head or face )    .
Other health problems involving the large blood vessels , heart , eyes , and / or brain may also occur    .
- LUMBAR / PELVIS /SACRAL
syndrome : A syndrome in which the hemangioma spreads across a large area of the lower back    .
Other health problems that affect the urinary system , genitals , rectum , anus , brain , spinal cord , and nerve function may also occur    .
Having more than one hemangioma or an airway hemangioma increases the risk of having other health problems    .
- Multiple hemangiomas : Having more than five hemangiomas on the skin is a sign that there may be hemangiomas in an organ , most commonly the liver    .
Heart , muscle , and thyroid gland problems can also occur    .
- Airway hemangiomas : Hemangiomas in the airway usually occur along with a large , beard - shaped area of hemangioma on the face ( from the ears , around the mouth , lower chin , and front of neck )    .
Signs and Symptoms Infantile hemangiomas may cause any of the following signs and symptoms    .
Check with your childs doctor if your child has any of the following : - Skin lesions :
An area of spidery veins or lightened or discolored skin may appear before the hemangioma does    .
Hemangiomas occur as firm , warm , bright red - blue lesions on the skin    .
Lesions that form ulcers are also painful    .
Later , as the hemangiomas go away , they begin fading in the center before flattening and losing color    .
- Lesions below the skin : Lesions that grow under the skin in the fat may appear blue or purple    .
If the lesions are deep enough under the skin surface , they may not be seen    .
- Lesions in an organ :
There may be no signs that hemangiomas have formed on an organ    .
Although most infantile hemangiomas are nothing to worry about , if your child develops any lumps or red or blue marks on the skin check with your child 's doctor    .
He or she can recommend a specialist if needed    .
Diagnostic Tests
A physical exam and history are usually all that are needed to diagnose infantile hemangiomas    .
If there is something about the tumor that looks unusual , a biopsy may be done    .
If the hemangioma is deeper inside the body with no change to the skin , or the lesions are spread across a large area of the body , an ultrasound or MRI may be done    .
See the General Information section for a description of these tests and procedures    .
If the hemangiomas are part of a syndrome , more tests may be done such as an echocardiogram , magnetic resonance angiogram , and eye exam    .
Treatment Most hemangiomas fade and shrink without treatment    .
If the hemangioma is large or causing other health problems , treatment may include the following : - Propranolol or other beta - blocker therapy    .
- Steroid therapy , before beta - blocker therapy is begun or when beta - blockers cannot be used    .
- Pulsed dye laser surgery , for hemangiomas that have ulcers or have not gone away    .
- Surgery ( excision ) for hemangiomas that have ulcers , cause vision problems , or have not gone away    .
- Topical beta - blocker therapy for hemangiomas that are in one area of the skin    .
- Combined therapy , such as propranolol and steroid therapy or propranolol and topical beta - blocker therapy    .
Congenital Hemangioma
Congenital hemangioma is a benign vascular tumor that begins forming before birth and is fully formed when the baby is born    .
They 're usually on the skin but can be in another organ    .
There are three types of congenital hemangiomas : - Rapidly Involuting Congenital Hemangioma :
These tumors go away on their own 12 to 15 months after birth    .
They can form ulcers , bleed , and cause temporary heart and blood clotting problems    .
The skin may look a little different even after the hemangiomas go away    .
- Partial Involuting Congenital Hemangioma :
These tumors do not go away completely    .
- Non-Involuting Congenital Hemangioma :
These tumors never go away on their own    .
Diagnostic Tests See the General Information section for a description of tests and procedures used to diagnose congenital hemangioma    .
Treatment Treatment of rapidly involuting congenital hemangioma and partial involuting congenital hemangioma may include the following : - Observation only    .
Treatment of non-involuting congenital hemangioma may include the following : - Surgery to remove the tumor depending on where it is and whether it is causing symptoms    .
Benign Vascular Tumors of the Liver
Benign vascular tumors of the liver may be focal ( a single lesion in one area of the liver ) , multifocal ( multiple lesions in one area of the liver ) , or diffuse ( multiple lesions in more than one area of the liver )    .
The liver has many functions , including filtering blood and making proteins needed for blood clotting    .
Sometimes , blood that normally flows through the liver is blocked or slowed by the tumor    .
This sends blood directly to the heart without going through the liver and is called a liver shunt    .
This can cause heart failure and problems with blood clotting    .
Focal Tumors
Diagnostic Tests
See the General Information section for a description of tests and procedures used to diagnose focal benign vascular tumors    .
Treatment Treatment of focal tumors of the liver depends on whether symptoms occur and may include the following : - Observation    .    - Drugs to manage symptoms , including heart failure and blood clotting problems    .
- Embolization of the liver to manage symptoms , including heart failure    .
Multifocal and Diffuse Tumors Multifocal and diffuse tumors of the liver are usually infantile hemangiomas    .
Diffuse tumors of the liver can cause serious effects , including problems with the thyroid gland and heart    .
The liver can enlarge , press on other organs , and cause more symptoms    .
Diagnostic Tests
See the General Information section for a description of tests and procedures used to diagnose multifocal or diffuse benign vascular tumors    .
Treatment Treatment of multifocal and diffuse liver tumors may include the following : - Observation for multifocal tumors of the liver that do not cause symptoms    .
- Beta - blocker therapy ( propranolol )    .
- Chemotherapy    .    - Steroid therapy    .    - Total hepatectomy and liver transplant , when the tumors do not respond to drug therapy    .
This is only done when the tumors have spread widely in the liver and more than one organ has failed    .
If a vascular tumor of the liver does not respond to standard treatments , a biopsy may be done to see if the tumor has become malignant    .
Spindle Cell Hemangioma
Spindle cell hemangiomas contain cells called spindle cells    .
Under a microscope , spindle cells look long and slender    .
Risk Factors
Anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor    .
Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get the disease ; not having risk factors doesnt mean that you will not get the disease    .
Talk with your child 's doctor if you think your child may be at risk    .
Spindle cell hemangiomas are likely to occur in children with the following syndromes : - Maffucci syndrome , which affects cartilage and skin    .
- Klippel - Trenaunay syndrome , which affects blood vessels , soft tissues , and bones    .
Signs Spindle cell hemangiomas appear on or under the skin    .
They are painful red - brown or bluish lesions that usually appear on the arms or legs    .
They can begin as one lesion and develop into more lesions over years    .
Diagnostic Tests
See the General Information section for a description of tests and procedures used to diagnose spindle cell hemangioma    .
Treatment
There is no standard treatment for spindle cell hemangiomas    .
Treatment may include the following : - Surgery to remove the tumor    .
Spindle cell hemangiomas may come back after surgery    .
Epithelioid Hemangioma
Epithelioid hemangiomas usually form on or in the skin , especially the head , but can occur in other areas , such as bone    .
Signs and Symptoms Epithelioid hemangiomas are sometimes caused by injury    .
On the skin , they may appear as firm pink to red bumps and may be itchy    .
Epithelioid hemangioma of the bone may cause swelling , pain , and weakened bone in the affected area    .
Diagnostic Tests See the General Information section for a description of tests and procedures used to diagnose epithelioid hemangioma    .
Treatment
There is no standard treatment for epithelioid hemangiomas    .
Treatment may include the following : - Surgery ( curettage or resection )    .
- Sclerotherapy    .    - Radiation therapy in rare cases    .
Epithelioid hemangiomas often come back after treatment    .
Pyogenic Granuloma
Pyogenic granuloma is also called lobular capillary hemangioma    .
It is most common in older children and young adults but may occur at any age    .
The lesions are sometimes caused by injury or from the use of certain medicines , including birth control pills and retinoids    .
They may also form for no known reason inside capillaries ( the smallest blood vessels ) or other places on the body    .
Usually there is only one lesion , but sometimes multiple lesions occur in the same area or the lesions may spread to other areas of the body    .
Signs Pyogenic granulomas are raised , bright red lesions that may be small or large and smooth or bumpy    .
They grow quickly over weeks to months and may bleed a lot    .
Diagnostic Tests
See the General Information section for a description of tests and procedures used to diagnose pyogenic granuloma    .
Treatment Some pyogenic granulomas go away without treatment    .
Other pyogenic granulomas need treatment that may include the following : - Surgery ( excision or curettage ) to remove the lesion    .
- Laser photocoagulation    .
Pyogenic granulomas often come back after treatment    .
Angiofibroma
Angiofibromas are rare    .
They are benign skin lesions that usually occur with a condition called tuberous sclerosis ( an inherited disorder that causes skin lesions , seizures , and mental disabilities )    .
Signs Angiofibromas appear as red bumps on the face    .
Diagnostic Tests See the General Information section for a description of tests and procedures used to diagnose angiofibroma    .
Treatment Treatment of angiofibromas may include the following : - Surgery ( excision ) to remove the tumor    .
- Laser therapy    .
- Targeted therapy ( sirolimus )    .
Juvenile Nasopharyngeal Angiofibroma
Juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibromas are benign tumors but they can invade nearby tissue    .
They begin in the nasal cavity and may spread to the nasopharynx , the paranasal sinuses , the bone around the eyes , and sometimes to the brain    .
Diagnostic Tests
See the General Information section for a description of tests and procedures used to diagnose juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma    .
Treatment Treatment of juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibromas may include the following : - Surgery ( excision ) to remove the tumor    .

- Targeted therapy ( sirolimus )    .
Intermediate Tumors that Spread Locally
Kaposiform Hemangioendothelioma and Tufted Angioma
Kaposiform hemangioendotheliomas and tufted angiomas are blood vessel tumors that occur in infants or during early childhood    .
These tumors can cause Kasabach - Merritt phenomenon , a condition in which the blood is not able to clot and serious bleeding may occur    .
In Kasabach - Merritt phenomenon the tumor traps and destroys platelets ( blood - clotting cells )    .
Then there are n't enough platelets in the blood when needed to stop bleeding    .
This type of vascular tumor is not related to Kaposi sarcoma    .
Signs and Symptoms Kaposiform hemangioendotheliomas and tufted angiomas usually occur on the skin of the arms and legs , but may also form in deeper tissues , such as muscle or bone    .
Signs and symptoms may include the following : - Firm , painful areas of skin that look bruised    .
- Purple or brownish - red areas of skin    .
- Easy bruising    .
- Bleeding more than the usual amount from mucous membranes , wounds , and other tissues    .
- Anemia ( weakness , feeling tired , or looking pale )    .
Diagnostic Tests
See the General Information section for a description of tests and procedures used to diagnose kaposiform hemangioendothelioma    .
If a physical exam and MRI clearly show the tumor is a kaposiform hemangioendothelioma or a tufted angioma , a biopsy may not be needed    .
A biopsy is not always done because serious bleeding can occur    .
Treatment Treatment of kaposiform hemangioendotheliomas and tufted angiomas depends on the child 's symptoms    .
Infection , delay in treatment , and surgery can cause bleeding that is life - threatening    .
Kaposiform hemangioendotheliomas and tufted angiomas are best treated by a vascular anomaly specialist    .
Treatment and supportive care to manage bleeding may include the following : - Steroid therapy which may be followed by chemotherapy    .
- Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAID ) , such as aspirin    .
- Immunotherapy ( interferon )    .
- Antifibrinolytic therapy to improve blood clotting    .
- Chemotherapy with one or more anticancer drugs    .
- Beta - blocker therapy ( propranolol )    .
- Surgery ( excision ) to remove the tumor , with or without embolization    .
- Targeted therapy ( sirolimus )    .    - A clinical trial of targeted therapy ( sirolimus ) and steroid therapy    .
Even with treatment , these tumors do not fully go away and can come back    .
Long - term effects include chronic pain , heart failure , bone problems , and lymphedema ( the build up of lymph fluid in tissues )    .
Intermediate Tumors that Rarely Spread
Retiform Hemangioendothelioma
Retiform hemangioendotheliomas are slow growing , flat tumors that occur in young adults and sometimes children    .
These tumors usually occur on or under the skin of the arms , legs , and trunk    .
These tumors often come back after treatment , but they usually do not spread to other parts of the body    .
Diagnostic Tests See the General Information section for a description of tests and procedures used to diagnose retiform hemangioendothelioma    .
Treatment Treatment of retiform hemangioendotheliomas may include the following : - Surgery ( excision ) to remove the tumor    .
Follow up will include monitoring to see if the tumor comes back    .
- Radiation therapy and chemotherapy when surgery cannot be done or when the tumor has come back    .
Papillary Intralymphatic Angioendothelioma
Papillary intralymphatic angioendotheliomas are also called Dabska tumors    .
These tumors form in or under the skin anywhere on the body    .
The tumors contain channels that look like lymph vessels    .
Lymph nodes are sometimes affected    .
Signs Papillary intralymphatic angioendotheliomas may appear as firm , raised , purplish bumps , which may be small or large    .
These tumors grow slowly over time    .
Diagnostic Tests
See the General Information section for a description of tests and procedures used to diagnose papillary intralymphatic angioendothelioma    .
Treatment Treatment of papillary intralymphatic angioendotheliomas may include the following : - Surgery ( excision ) to remove the tumor    .
Composite Hemangioendothelioma
Composite hemangioendotheliomas have features of both benign and malignant vascular tumors    .
These tumors usually occur on or under the skin on the arms or legs    .
They may also occur on the head , neck , or chest    .
Composite hemangioendotheliomas are not likely to metastasize ( spread ) but they may come back in the same place    .
When the tumors metastasize , they usually spread to nearby lymph nodes    .
Diagnostic Tests
See the General Information section for a description of tests and procedures used to diagnose composite hemangioendothelioma and find out whether the tumor has spread    .
Treatment Treatment of composite hemangioendotheliomas may include the following : - Surgery to remove the tumor    .
- Radiation therapy and chemotherapy for tumors that have spread    .
Kaposi Sarcoma
Kaposi sarcoma is a cancer that causes lesions to grow in the skin ; the mucous membranes lining the mouth , nose , and throat ; lymph nodes ; or other organs    .
It is caused by the Kaposi sarcoma herpes virus ( KSHV )    .
In the United States , it usually occurs in people who have a weak immune system caused by AIDS or by drugs used in organ transplants    .
It is very rare in children and can be caused by HIV infection and rare immune system disorders    .
Signs Signs in children may include the following : - Lesions in the skin , mouth , or throat    .
Skin lesions are red , purple , or brown and change from flat , to raised , to scaly areas called plaques , to nodules    .
- Swollen lymph nodes    .
Diagnostic Tests See the General Information section for a description of tests and procedures used to diagnose Kaposi sarcoma    .
Treatment Treatment of Kaposi sarcoma may include the following : - Chemotherapy    .
See the PDQ summary on Kaposi Sarcoma Treatment for information about Kaposi sarcoma in adults    .
Malignant Tumors
Epithelioid Hemangioendothelioma
Epithelioid hemangioendotheliomas can occur in children , but are most common in adults between 30 and 50 years of age    .
They usually occur in the liver , lung , or in bone    .
They may be either fast growing or slow growing    .
In about a third of cases , the tumor spreads to other parts of the body very quickly    .
Signs and Symptoms Signs and symptoms depend on where the tumor is : - On the skin , the tumors can be raised and rounded or flat , red - brown patches that feel warm    .
- In the lung , there may be no early symptoms    .
Signs and symptoms that occur may include : - Chest pain    .
- Spitting up blood    .
- Anemia ( weakness , feeling tired , or looking pale )    .
- Trouble breathing ( from scarred lung tissue )    .
- In bone , the tumors can cause breaks    .
Diagnostic Tests Epithelioid hemangioendotheliomas in the liver are found with CT scans and MRI scans    .
See the General Information section for a description of these tests and procedures used to diagnose epithelioid hemangioendothelioma and find out whether the tumor has spread    .
X - rays may also be done    .
Treatment Treatment of slow - growing epithelioid hemangioendotheliomas includes the following : - Observation    .
Treatment of fast - growing epithelioid hemangioendotheliomas may include the following : - Surgery to remove the tumor when possible    .
- Immunotherapy ( interferon ) and targeted therapy ( thalidomide , sorafenib , pazopanib , sirolimus ) for tumors that are likely to spread    .
- Chemotherapy    .    - Total hepatectomy and liver transplant when the tumor is in the liver    .
Angiosarcoma of the Soft Tissue
Angiosarcomas are fast - growing tumors that form in blood vessels or lymph vessels in any part of the body , usually in soft tissue    .
Most angiosarcomas are in or near the skin    .
Those in deeper soft tissue can form in the liver , spleen , and lung    .
These tumors are very rare in children    .
Children sometimes have more than one tumor in the skin and / or liver    .
Risk Factors
Anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor    .
Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get the disease ; not having risk factors doesnt mean that you will not get the disease    .
Talk with your child 's doctor if you think your child may be at risk    .
Risk factors for angiosarcomas include the following : - Being exposed to radiation    .
- Chronic ( long - term ) lymphedema , a condition in which extra lymph fluid builds up in tissues and causes swelling    .
- Having a benign vascular tumor    .
A benign tumor , such as a hemangioma , may become an angiosarcoma but this rare    .
Signs Signs of angiosarcoma depend on where the tumor is and may include the following : - Red patches on the skin that bleed easily    .
- Purple tumors    .
Diagnostic Tests
See the General Information section for a description of tests and procedures used to diagnose angiosarcoma and find out whether the tumor has spread    .
Treatment Treatment of angiosarcoma may include the following : - Surgery to completely remove the tumor    .    - A combination of surgery , chemotherapy , and radiation therapy for angiosarcomas that have spread    .
- Targeted therapy ( bevacizumab ) and chemotherapy for angiosarcomas that began as infantile hemangiomas    .
- A clinical trial of targeted therapy , radiation therapy , and surgery with or without chemotherapy    .
How to diagnose Childhood Vascular Tumors ?
Tests are used to detect ( find ) and diagnose childhood vascular tumors    .
The following tests and procedures may be used : - Physical exam and history :
An exam of the body to check general signs of health , including checking for signs of disease , such as lumps , lesions , or anything else that seems unusual    .
A history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken    .
- Ultrasound exam :
A procedure in which high - energy sound waves ( ultrasound ) are bounced off internal tissues or organs and make echoes    .
The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram    .
The picture can be printed to be looked at later    .
- CT scan ( CAT scan ) : A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body , taken from different angles    .
The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine    .
A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly    .
This procedure is also called computed tomography , computerized tomography , or computerized axial tomography    .
- MRI ( magnetic resonance imaging ) : A procedure that uses a magnet , radio waves , and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body    .
This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging ( NMRI )    .
- Biopsy :
The removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer    .
A biopsy is not always needed to diagnose a vascular tumor    .
What are the treatments for Childhood Vascular Tumors ?
Key Points
- There are different types of treatment for childhood vascular tumors    .
- Children with childhood vascular tumors should have their treatment planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating cancer in children    .
- Some treatments cause side effects months or years after treatment has ended    .
- Eleven types of standard treatment are used : - Beta - blocker therapy - Surgery - Photocoagulation - Embolization - Chemotherapy - Sclerotherapy - Radiation therapy - Targeted therapy - Immunotherapy - Other drug therapy - Observation - New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials    .
- Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
- Patients can enter clinical trials before , during , or after starting their cancer treatment    .
- Follow - up tests may be needed    .
There are different types of treatment for childhood vascular tumors    .
Different types of treatment are available for children with vascular tumors    .
Some treatments are standard ( the currently used treatment ) , and some are being tested in clinical trials    .
A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments    .
When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment , the new treatment may become the standard treatment    .
Because vascular tumors in children are rare , taking part in a clinical trial should be considered    .
Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment    .
Children with childhood vascular tumors should have their treatment planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating cancer in children    .
Treatment will be overseen by a pediatric oncologist , a doctor who specializes in treating children with cancer    .
The pediatric oncologist works with other pediatric health care providers who are experts in treating children with cancer and who specialize in certain areas of medicine    .
These may include the following specialists : - Pediatric vascular anomaly specialist ( expert in treating children with vascular tumors )    .
- Pediatric surgeon    .
- Orthopedic surgeon    .
- Radiation oncologist    .
- Pediatric nurse specialist    .
- Rehabilitation specialist    .
- Psychologist    .    - Social worker    .
Some treatments cause side effects months or years after treatment has ended    .
Some treatments , such as chemotherapy and radiation therapy , cause side effects that continue or appear months or years after treatment has ended    .
These are called late effects    .
Late effects of treatment may include : - Physical problems    .
- Changes in mood , feelings , thinking , learning , or memory    .
- Second cancers ( new types of cancer )    .
Some late effects may be treated or controlled    .
It is important to talk with your child 's doctors about the possible late effects caused by some treatments    .
( See the PDQ summary on Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer for more information )    .
Eleven types of standard treatment are used :
Beta - blocker therapy Beta - blockers are drugs that decrease blood pressure and heart rate    .
When used in patients with vascular tumors , beta - blockers may help shrink the tumors    .
Beta - blocker therapy may be given by vein ( IV ) , by mouth , or placed on the skin ( topical )    .
The way the beta - blocker therapy is given depends on the type of vascular tumor and where the tumor first formed    .
The beta - blocker propranolol is usually the first treatment for hemangiomas    .
Infants treated with IV propranolol may need to have their treatment started in a hospital    .
Propranolol is also used to treat benign vascular tumor of liver and kaposiform hemangioendothelioma    .
Other beta - blockers used to treat vascular tumors include atenolol , nadolol , and timolol    .
Infantile hemangioma may also be treated with propranolol and steroid therapy or propranolol and topical beta - blocker therapy    .
See the drug information summary on Propranolol Hydrochloride for more information    .
Surgery
The following types of surgery may be used to remove many types of vascular tumors : - Excision : Surgery to remove the entire tumor and some of the healthy tissue around it    .
- Laser surgery : A surgical procedure that uses a laser beam ( a narrow beam of intense light ) as a knife to make bloodless cuts in tissue or to remove a skin lesion such as a tumor    .
Surgery with a pulsed dye laser may be used for some hemangiomas    .
This type of laser uses a beam of light that targets blood vessels in the skin    .
The light is changed into heat and the blood vessels are destroyed without damaging nearby skin    .
- Total hepatectomy and liver transplant : A surgical procedure to remove the entire liver followed by a transplant of a healthy liver from a donor    .
- Curettage : A procedure in which abnormal tissue is removed using a small , spoon - shaped instrument called a curette    .
The type of surgery used depends on the type of vascular tumor and where the tumor formed in the body    .
For malignant tumors , even if the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery , some patients may be given chemotherapy or radiation therapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left    .
Treatment given after the surgery , to lower the risk that the tumor will come back , is called adjuvant therapy    .
Photocoagulation Photocoagulation is the use of an intense beam of light , such as a laser , to seal off blood vessels or destroy tissue    .
It is used to treat pyogenic granuloma    .
Embolization Embolization is a procedure that uses particles , such as tiny gelatin sponges or beads , to block blood vessels in the liver    .
It may be used to treat some benign vascular tumors of the liver and kaposiform hemangioendothelioma    .
Chemotherapy Chemotherapy is a treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of tumor cells , either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing    .
When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle , the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach tumor cells throughout the body ( systemic chemotherapy )    .
When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid , an organ , or a body cavity such as the abdomen , the drugs mainly affect tumor cells in those areas ( regional chemotherapy )    .
Chemotherapy for hemangiomas may also be given topically ( applied to the skin in a cream or lotion )    .
The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type of the vascular tumor being treated    .
Sclerotherapy Sclerotherapy is a treatment used to destroy the blood vessel with the tumor    .
A liquid is injected into the blood vessel , causing it to scar and break down    .
Over time , the destroyed blood vessel is absorbed into normal tissue    .
The blood flows through nearby healthy veins instead    .
Sclerotherapy is used in the treatment of epithelioid hemangioma    .
Radiation therapy Radiation therapy is a treatment that uses high - energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill tumor cells or keep them from growing    .
There are two types of radiation therapy : - External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the tumor    .
- Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles , seeds , wires , or catheters that are placed directly into or near the tumor    .
The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type of the vascular tumor being treated    .
External radiation is used to treat some vascular tumors    .
Targeted therapy Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to attack specific tumor cells    .
Targeted therapies usually cause less harm to normal cells than chemotherapy or radiation therapy do    .
Angiogenesis inhibitors are a type of targeted therapy    .
- Angiogenesis inhibitors are drugs that stop cells from dividing and prevent the growth of new blood vessels that tumors need to grow    .
The targeted therapy drugs thalidomide , sorafenib , pazopanib , sirolimus , and bevacizumab are angiogenesis inhibitors used to treat childhood vascular tumors    .
Immunotherapy Immunotherapy is a treatment that uses the patients immune system to fight disease    .
Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost , direct , or restore the bodys natural defenses against disease    .
Interferon is a type of immunotherapy used to treat childhood vascular tumors    .
It interferes with the division of tumor cells and can slow tumor growth    .
It is used in the treatment of juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma , kaposiform hemangioendothelioma , and epithelioid hemangioendothelioma    .
Other drug therapy
Other drugs used to treat childhood vascular tumors or manage their effects include the following : - Steroid therapy : Steroids are hormones made naturally in the body    .
They can also be made in a laboratory and used as drugs    .
Steroid drugs help shrink some vascular tumors    .
- Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) : NSAIDs are commonly used to decrease fever , swelling , pain , and redness    .
Examples of NSAIDs are aspirin , ibuprofen , and naproxen    .
In the treatment of vascular tumors , NSAIDs can increase the flow of blood through the tumors and decrease the chance that an unwanted blood clot will form    .
- Antifibrinolytic therapy :
These drugs help the blood clot in patients who have Kasabach - Merritt syndrome    .
Fibrin is the main protein in a blood clot that helps stop bleeding and heal wounds    .
Some vascular tumors cause fibrin to break down and the patient 's blood does not clot normally , causing uncontrolled bleeding    .
Antifibrinolytics help prevent the breakdown of fibrin    .
Observation Observation is closely monitoring a patients condition without giving any treatment until signs or symptoms appear or change    .
New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials    .
Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website    .
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
For some patients , taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice    .
Clinical trials are part of the research process    .
Clinical trials are done to find out if new treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment    .
Many of today 's standard treatments are based on earlier clinical trials    .
Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment    .
Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way disease will be treated in the future    .
Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments , they often answer important questions and help move research forward    .
Patients can enter clinical trials before , during , or after starting their cancer treatment    .
Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment    .
Other trials test treatments for patients whose tumors have not gotten better    .
There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop tumors from recurring ( coming back ) or reduce the side effects of treatment    .
Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country    .
See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials    .
These have been retrieved from NCI 's listing of clinical trials    .
Follow - up tests may be needed    .
Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the vascular tumor may be repeated    .
Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working    .
Decisions about whether to continue , change , or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests    .
Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended    .
The results of these tests can show if your child 's condition has changed or if the tumor has recurred ( come back )    .
These tests are sometimes called follow - up tests or check - ups    .

What is (are) Adult Hodgkin Lymphoma ?
Key Points
- Adult Hodgkin lymphoma is a disease in which malignant ( cancer ) cells form in the lymph system    .    - There are two main types of Hodgkin lymphoma : classical and nodular lymphocyte - predominant    .
- Age , gender , and Epstein - Barr infection can affect the risk of adult Hodgkin lymphoma    .
- Signs of adult Hodgkin lymphoma include swollen lymph nodes , fever , night sweats , and weight loss    .
- Tests that examine the lymph nodes are used to detect ( find ) and diagnose adult Hodgkin lymphoma    .
- Certain factors affect prognosis ( chance of recovery ) and treatment options    .
Adult Hodgkin lymphoma is a disease in which malignant ( cancer ) cells form in the lymph system    .
Adult Hodgkin lymphoma is a type of cancer that develops in the lymph system , part of the body 's immune system    .
The lymph system is made up of the following : - Lymph : Colorless , watery fluid that carries white blood cells called lymphocytes through the lymph system    .
Lymphocytes protect the body against infections and the growth of tumors    .
- Lymph vessels : A network of thin tubes that collect lymph from different parts of the body and return it to the bloodstream    .
- Lymph nodes : Small , bean - shaped structures that filter lymph and store white blood cells that help fight infection and disease    .
Lymph nodes are located along the network of lymph vessels found throughout the body    .
Clusters of lymph nodes are found in the neck , underarm , abdomen , pelvis , and groin    .
- Spleen :
It is located on the left side of the abdomen near the stomach    .
- Thymus :
The thymus is in the chest behind the breastbone    .
- Tonsils :
The tonsils make lymphocytes    .
- Bone marrow :
Bone marrow makes white blood cells , red blood cells , and platelets    .
Lymph tissue is also found in other parts of the body such as the stomach , thyroid gland , brain , and skin    .
Cancer can spread to the liver and lungs    .
Lymphomas are divided into two general types : Hodgkin lymphoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma    .
This summary is about the treatment of adult Hodgkin lymphoma    .
( See the PDQ summary on Adult Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Treatment for more information    .    )
Hodgkin lymphoma can occur in both adults and children    .
Treatment for adults is different than treatment for children    .
Hodgkin lymphoma may also occur in patients who have acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) ; these patients require special treatment    .
See the following PDQ summaries for more information : - Childhood Hodgkin Lymphoma Treatment - AIDS - Related Lymphoma Treatment Hodgkin lymphoma in pregnant women is the same as the disease in nonpregnant women of childbearing age    .
However , treatment is different for pregnant women    .
This summary includes information about treating Hodgkin lymphoma during pregnancy    .
There are two main types of Hodgkin lymphoma : classical and nodular lymphocyte - predominant    .
Most Hodgkin lymphomas are the classical type    .
Who is at risk for Adult Hodgkin Lymphoma? ?
Age , gender , and Epstein - Barr infection can affect the risk of adult Hodgkin lymphoma    .
Anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor    .
Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer ; not having risk factors does n't mean that you will not get cancer    .
Talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk    .
Risk factors for adult Hodgkin lymphoma include the following : - Being in young or late adulthood    .
- Being male    .
- Being infected with the Epstein - Barr virus    .
- Having a first - degree relative ( parent , brother , or sister ) with Hodgkin lymphoma    .
Pregnancy is not a risk factor for Hodgkin lymphoma    .
What are the symptoms of Adult Hodgkin Lymphoma ?
Signs of adult Hodgkin lymphoma include swollen lymph nodes , fever , night sweats , and weight loss    .
These and other signs and symptoms may be caused by adult Hodgkin lymphoma or by other conditions    .
Check with your doctor if any of the following do not go away : - Painless , swollen lymph nodes in the neck , underarm , or groin    .
- Fever for no known reason    .
- Drenching night sweats    .
- Weight loss for no known reason    .
- Itchy skin    .
- Feeling very tired    .
How to diagnose Adult Hodgkin Lymphoma ?
Tests that examine the lymph nodes are used to detect ( find ) and diagnose adult Hodgkin lymphoma    .
The following tests and procedures may be used : - Physical exam and history :
An exam of the body to check general signs of health , including checking for signs of disease , such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual    .
A history of the patient 's past illnesses and treatments will also be taken    .
- Complete blood count ( CBC ) : A procedure in which a sample of blood is drawn and checked for the following : - The number of red blood cells , white blood cells , and platelets    .
- The amount of hemoglobin ( the protein that carries oxygen ) in the red blood cells    .
- The portion of the sample made up of red blood cells    .
- Blood chemistry studies :
A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body    .
An unusual ( higher or lower than normal ) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease    .
The sedimentation rate is a measure of how much inflammation is in the body    .
A higher than normal sedimentation rate may be a sign of lymphoma or another condition    .
Also called erythrocyte sedimentation rate , sed rate , or ESR    .
- Lymph node biopsy :
The removal of all or part of a lymph node    .
One of the following types of biopsies may be done : - Excisional biopsy :
The removal of an entire lymph node    .
- Incisional biopsy :
The removal of part of a lymph node    .
- Core biopsy :
The removal of part of a lymph node using a wide needle    .
A pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells , especially Reed - Sternberg cells    .
Reed - Sternberg cells are common in classical Hodgkin lymphoma    .
The following test may be done on tissue that was removed : - Immunophenotyping :
A laboratory test used to identify cells , based on the types of antigens or markers on the surface of the cell    .
This test is used to diagnose the specific type of lymphoma by comparing the cancer cells to normal cells of the immune system    .
What is the outlook for Adult Hodgkin Lymphoma ?
Certain factors affect prognosis ( chance of recovery ) and treatment options    .
The prognosis ( chance of recovery ) and treatment options depend on the following : - The patient 's signs and symptoms    .
- The stage of the cancer    .    - The type of Hodgkin lymphoma    .    - Blood test results    .    - The patient 's age , gender , and general health    .
- Whether the cancer is recurrent or progressive    .
For Hodgkin lymphoma during pregnancy , treatment options also depend on : - The wishes of the patient    .    - The age of the fetus    .
Adult Hodgkin lymphoma can usually be cured if found and treated early    .
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Adult Hodgkin Lymphoma ?
New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials    .
This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials    .
It may not mention every new treatment being studied    .
Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website    .
Chemotherapy and radiation therapy with stem cell transplant High - dose chemotherapy and radiation therapy with stem cell transplant is a way of giving high doses of chemotherapy and radiation therapy and replacing blood - forming cells destroyed by the cancer treatment    .
Stem cells ( immature blood cells ) are removed from the blood or bone marrow of the patient or a donor and are frozen and stored    .
After therapy is completed , the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion    .
These reinfused stem cells grow into ( and restore ) the body 's blood cells    .
The use of lower - dose chemotherapy and radiation therapy with stem cell transplant is also being studied    .
Monoclonal antibody therapy Monoclonal antibody therapy is a cancer treatment that uses antibodies made in the laboratory , from a single type of immune system cell    .
These antibodies can identify substances on cancer cells or normal substances that may help cancer cells grow    .
The antibodies attach to the substances and kill the cancer cells , block their growth , or keep them from spreading    .
Monoclonal antibodies are given by infusion    .
They may be used alone or to carry drugs , toxins , or radioactive material directly to cancer cells    .
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
For some patients , taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice    .
Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process    .
Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment    .
Many of today 's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials    .
Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment    .
Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future    .
Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments , they often answer important questions and help move research forward    .
Patients can enter clinical trials before , during , or after starting their cancer treatment    .
Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment    .
Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better    .
There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring ( coming back ) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment    .
Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country    .
See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials    .
These have been retrieved from NCI 's listing of clinical trials    .
What are the stages of Adult Hodgkin Lymphoma ?
Key Points
- After adult Hodgkin lymphoma has been diagnosed , tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the lymph system or to other parts of the body    .
- There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body    .
- Stages of adult Hodgkin lymphoma may include A , B , E , and S   .    - The following stages are used for adult Hodgkin lymphoma : - Stage I - Stage II - Stage III - Stage IV - Adult Hodgkin lymphoma may be grouped for treatment as follows : - Early Favorable - Early Unfavorable - Advanced
After adult Hodgkin lymphoma has been diagnosed , tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the lymph system or to other parts of the body    .
The process used to find out if cancer has spread within the lymph system or to other parts of the body is called staging    .
The information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease    .
It is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment    .
The following tests and procedures may be used in the staging process : - CT scan ( CAT scan ) :
A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body , taken from different angles    .
The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine    .
A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly    .
This procedure is also called computed tomography , computerized tomography , or computerized axial tomography    .
For adult Hodgkin lymphoma , CT scans of the neck , chest , abdomen , and pelvis are taken    .
- PET -CT scan :
A procedure that combines the pictures from a positron emission tomography ( PET ) scan and a computed tomography ( CT ) scan    .
The PET and CT scans are done at the same time on the same machine    .
The pictures from both scans are combined to make a more detailed picture than either test would make by itself    .
A PET scan is a procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body    .
A small amount of radioactive glucose ( sugar ) is injected into a vein    .
The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body    .
Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do    .
- Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy :
The removal of bone marrow , blood , and a small piece of bone by inserting a hollow needle into the hipbone or breastbone    .
A pathologist views the bone marrow , blood , and bone under a microscope to look for signs of cancer    .
For pregnant women with Hodgkin lymphoma , staging tests that protect the fetus from the harms of radiation are used    .
These include : - MRI ( magnetic resonance imaging ) : A procedure that uses a magnet , radio waves , and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body    .
This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging ( NMRI )    .
- Ultrasound exam :
A procedure in which high - energy sound waves ( ultrasound ) are bounced off internal tissues or organs and make echoes    .
The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram    .
There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body    .
Cancer can spread through tissue , the lymph system , and the blood : - Tissue    .
The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas    .
- Lymph system    .
The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system    .
The cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body    .
- Blood    .
The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood    .
The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body    .
Stages of adult Hodgkin lymphoma may include A , B , E , and S    .
Adult Hodgkin lymphoma may be described as follows : - A : The patient does not have B symptoms ( fever , weight loss , or night sweats )    .
- B : The patient has B symptoms    .
- E : Cancer is found in an organ or tissue that is not part of the lymph system but which may be next to an involved area of the lymph system    .
- S : Cancer is found in the spleen    .
The following stages are used for adult Hodgkin lymphoma :
Stage I Stage I is divided into stage I and stage IE    .
- Stage I : Cancer is found in one of the following places in the lymph system : - One or more lymph nodes in one lymph node group    .
- Waldeyer 's ring    .
- Thymus    .    - Spleen    .    - Stage IE : Cancer is found outside the lymph system in one organ or area    .
Stage II Stage II is divided into stage II and stage IIE    .
- Stage II : Cancer is found in two or more lymph node groups either above or below the diaphragm ( the thin muscle below the lungs that helps breathing and separates the chest from the abdomen )    .
- Stage IIE : Cancer is found in one or more lymph node groups either above or below the diaphragm and outside the lymph nodes in a nearby organ or area    .
Stage III Stage III is divided into stage III , stage IIIE , stage IIIS , and stage IIIE , S   .    - Stage III : Cancer is found in lymph node groups above and below the diaphragm ( the thin muscle below the lungs that helps breathing and separates the chest from the abdomen )    .
- Stage IIIE : Cancer is found in lymph node groups above and below the diaphragm and outside the lymph nodes in a nearby organ or area    .
- Stage IIIS : Cancer is found in lymph node groups above and below the diaphragm , and in the spleen    .
- Stage IIIE,S : Cancer is found in lymph node groups above and below the diaphragm , outside the lymph nodes in a nearby organ or area , and in the spleen    .
Stage IV
In stage IV , the cancer : - is found outside the lymph nodes throughout one or more organs , and may be in lymph nodes near those organs ; or - is found outside the lymph nodes in one organ and has spread to areas far away from that organ ; or - is found in the lung , liver , bone marrow , or cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF )    .
The cancer has not spread to the lung , liver , bone marrow , or CSF from nearby areas    .
Adult Hodgkin lymphoma may be grouped for treatment as follows :
Early Favorable Early favorable adult Hodgkin lymphoma is stage I or stage II , without risk factors    .
Early Unfavorable Early unfavorable adult Hodgkin lymphoma is stage I or stage II with one or more of the following risk factors : - A tumor in the chest that is larger than 1/3 of the width of the chest or at least 10 centimeters    .
- Cancer in an organ other than the lymph nodes    .    - A high sedimentation rate ( in a sample of blood , the red blood cells settle to the bottom of the test tube more quickly than normal )    .
- Three or more lymph nodes with cancer    .
- Symptoms such as fever , weight loss , or night sweats    .
Advanced Advanced Hodgkin lymphoma includes some or all of the following risk factors : - Being male    .
- Being aged 45 years or older    .
- Having stage IV disease    .
- Having a low blood albumin ( protein ) level ( below 4 )    .    - Having a low hemoglobin level ( below 10   .   5 )    .
- Having a high white blood cell count ( 15,000 or higher )    .
- Having a low lymphocyte count ( below 600 or less than 8 % of the white blood cell count )    .
What are the treatments for Adult Hodgkin Lymphoma ?
Key Points
- There are different types of treatment for patients with adult Hodgkin lymphoma    .
- Patients with Hodgkin lymphoma should have their treatment planned by a team of health care providers with expertise in treating lymphomas    .
- Patients may develop late effects that appear months or years after their treatment for Hodgkin lymphoma    .    - Three types of standard treatment are used : - Chemotherapy - Radiation therapy - Surgery - For pregnant patients with Hodgkin lymphoma , treatment options also include : - Watchful waiting - Steroid therapy - New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials    .
- Chemotherapy and radiation therapy with stem cell transplant - Monoclonal antibody therapy - Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
- Patients can enter clinical trials before , during , or after starting their cancer treatment    .
- Follow - up tests may be needed    .
There are different types of treatment for patients with adult Hodgkin lymphoma    .
Different types of treatment are available for patients with adult Hodgkin lymphoma    .
Some treatments are standard ( the currently used treatment ) , and some are being tested in clinical trials    .
A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer    .
When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment , the new treatment may become the standard treatment    .
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment    .
For pregnant women with Hodgkin lymphoma , treatment is carefully chosen to protect the fetus    .
Treatment decisions are based on the mothers wishes , the stage of the Hodgkin lymphoma , and the age of the fetus    .
The treatment plan may change as the signs and symptoms , cancer , and pregnancy change    .
Choosing the most appropriate cancer treatment is a decision that ideally involves the patient , family , and health care team    .
Patients with Hodgkin lymphoma should have their treatment planned by a team of health care providers with expertise in treating lymphomas    .
Treatment will be overseen by a medical oncologist , a doctor who specializes in treating cancer    .
The medical oncologist may refer you to other health care providers who have experience and expertise in treating adult Hodgkin lymphoma and who specialize in certain areas of medicine    .
These may include the following specialists : - Neurosurgeon    .    - Neurologist    .
- Rehabilitation specialist    .
- Radiation oncologist    .
- Endocrinologist    .    - Hematologist    .    - Other oncology specialists    .
Patients may develop late effects that appear months or years after their treatment for Hodgkin lymphoma    .
Treatment with chemotherapy and / or radiation therapy for Hodgkin lymphoma may increase the risk of second cancers and other health problems for many months or years after treatment    .
These late effects depend on the type of treatment and the patient 's age when treated , and may include : - Acute myelogenous leukemia    .
- Cancer of the breast , bone , cervix , gastrointestinal tract , head and neck , lung , soft tissue , and thyroid    .
- Heart , lung , and thyroid disease    .
- Avascular necrosis of bone ( death of bone cells caused by lack of blood flow )    .
- Herpes zoster ( shingles ) or severe infection    .
- Depression and fatigue    .
- Infertility    .    - Hypogonadism ( low levels of testosterone and estrogen )    .
Regular follow - up by doctors who are expert in finding and treating late effects is important for the long - term health of patients treated for Hodgkin lymphoma    .
Three types of standard treatment are used :
Chemotherapy Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells , either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing    .
When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle , the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body ( systemic chemotherapy )    .
When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid , an organ , or a body cavity such as the abdomen , the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas ( regional chemotherapy )    .
The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated    .
Combination chemotherapy is treatment with more than one anticancer drug    .
When a pregnant woman is treated with chemotherapy for Hodgkin lymphoma , it is n't possible to protect the fetus from being exposed to the chemotherapy    .
Some chemotherapy regimens may cause birth defects if given in the first trimester    .
See Drugs Approved for Hodgkin Lymphoma for more information    .
Radiation therapy Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high - energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing    .
There are two types of radiation therapy : - External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer    .
- Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles , seeds , wires , or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer    .
The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated    .
External radiation therapy is used to treat adult Hodgkin lymphoma    .
For a pregnant woman with Hodgkin lymphoma , radiation therapy should be postponed until after delivery , if possible , to avoid any risk to the fetus    .
If immediate treatment is needed , the woman may decide to continue the pregnancy and receive radiation therapy    .
However , lead used to shield the fetus may not protect it from scattered radiation that could possibly cause cancer in the future    .
Surgery Laparotomy is a procedure in which an incision ( cut ) is made in the wall of the abdomen to check the inside of the abdomen for signs of disease    .
The size of the incision depends on the reason the laparotomy is being done    .
Sometimes organs are removed or tissue samples are taken and checked under a microscope for signs of disease    .
If cancer is found , the tissue or organ is removed during the laparotomy    .
For pregnant patients with Hodgkin lymphoma , treatment options also include :
Watchful waiting Watchful waiting is closely monitoring a patients condition without giving any treatment unless signs or symptoms appear or change    .
Delivery may be induced when the fetus is 32 to 36 weeks old , so that the mother can begin treatment    .
Steroid therapy Steroids are hormones made naturally in the body by the adrenal glands and by reproductive organs    .
Some types of steroids are made in a laboratory    .
Certain steroid drugs have been found to help chemotherapy work better and help stop the growth of cancer cells    .
Steroids can also help the lungs of the fetus develop faster than normal    .
This is important when delivery is induced early    .
See Drugs Approved for Hodgkin Lymphoma for more information    .
New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials    .
This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials    .

Follow - up tests may be needed    .
Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated    .
Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working    .
Decisions about whether to continue , change , or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests    .
Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended    .
The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred ( come back )    .
These tests are sometimes called follow - up tests or check - ups    .

Treatment Options for Hodgkin Lymphoma During Pregnancy
Hodgkin Lymphoma During the First Trimester of Pregnancy
When Hodgkin lymphoma is diagnosed in the first trimester of pregnancy , it does not necessarily mean that the woman will be advised to end the pregnancy    .
Each woman 's treatment will depend on the stage of the lymphoma , how fast it is growing , and her wishes    .
For women who choose to continue the pregnancy , treatment of Hodgkin lymphoma during the first trimester of pregnancy may include the following : - Watchful waiting when the cancer is above the diaphragm and is slow - growing    .
Delivery may be induced when the fetus is 32 to 36 weeks old so the mother can begin treatment    .
- Radiation therapy above the diaphragm    .
( A lead shield is used to protect the fetus from the radiation as much as possible    .    )
- Systemic chemotherapy using one or more drugs    .
Hodgkin Lymphoma During the Second Half of Pregnancy
When Hodgkin lymphoma is diagnosed in the second half of pregnancy , most women can delay treatment until after the baby is born    .
Treatment of Hodgkin lymphoma during the second half of pregnancy may include the following : - Watchful waiting , with plans to induce delivery when the fetus is 32 to 36 weeks old    .
- Systemic chemotherapy using one or more drugs    .
- Steroid therapy    .
- Radiation therapy to relieve breathing problems caused by a large tumor in the chest    .
What is (are) Adult Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma ?
Key Points
- Adult non-Hodgkin lymphoma is a disease in which malignant ( cancer ) cells form in the lymph system    .
- The major types of lymphoma are Hodgkin lymphoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma    .
- Non-Hodgkin lymphoma can be indolent or aggressive    .
- Age , gender , and a weakened immune system can affect the risk of adult non-Hodgkin lymphoma    .
- Signs and symptoms of adult non-Hodgkin lymphoma include swelling in the lymph nodes , fever , night sweats , weight loss , and fatigue    .
- Tests that examine the body and lymph system are used to help detect ( find ) and diagnose adult non-Hodgkin lymphoma    .
- Certain factors affect prognosis ( chance of recovery ) and treatment options    .
Adult non-Hodgkin lymphoma is a disease in which malignant ( cancer ) cells form in the lymph system    .
Non-Hodgkin lymphoma is a type of cancer that forms in the lymph system , which is part of the body 's immune system    .
The immune system protects the body from foreign substances , infection , and diseases    .
The lymph system is made up of the following : - Lymph : Colorless , watery fluid that carries white blood cells called lymphocytes through the lymph system    .
Lymphocytes protect the body against infection and the growth of tumors    .
There are three types of lymphocytes : - B lymphocytes that make antibodies to help fight infection    .
Also called B cells    .
Most types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma begin in B lymphocytes    .    - T lymphocytes that help B lymphocytes make the antibodies that help fight infection    .
Also called T cells    .
- Natural killer cells that attack cancer cells and viruses    .
Also called NK cells    .
Non-Hodgkin lymphoma can begin in B lymphocytes , T lymphocytes , or natural killer cells    .
Lymphocytes can also be found in the blood and also collect in the lymph nodes , spleen , and thymus    .
- Lymph vessels : A network of thin tubes that collect lymph from different parts of the body and return it to the bloodstream    .
- Lymph nodes : Small , bean - shaped structures that filter lymph and store white blood cells that help fight infection and disease    .
Lymph nodes are located along the network of lymph vessels found throughout the body    .
Clusters of lymph nodes are found in the neck , underarm , abdomen , pelvis , and groin    .
- Spleen :
An organ that makes lymphocytes , filters the blood , stores blood cells , and destroys old blood cells    .
It is on the left side of the abdomen near the stomach    .
- Thymus :
An organ in which lymphocytes grow and multiply    .
The thymus is in the chest behind the breastbone    .
- Tonsils :
Two small masses of lymph tissue at the back of the throat    .
The tonsils make lymphocytes    .
- Bone marrow :
The soft , spongy tissue in the center of large bones    .
Bone marrow makes white blood cells , red blood cells , and platelets    .
Lymph tissue is also found in other parts of the body such as the stomach , thyroid gland , brain , and skin    .
Cancer can spread to the liver and lungs    .
Non-Hodgkin lymphoma during pregnancy is rare    .
Non-Hodgkin lymphoma in pregnant women is the same as the disease in nonpregnant women of childbearing age    .
However , treatment is different for pregnant women    .
This summary includes information on the treatment of non-Hodgkin lymphoma during pregnancy ( see the Treatment Options for Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma During Pregnancy section for more information )    .
Non-Hodgkin lymphoma can occur in both adults and children    .
Treatment for adults is different than treatment for children    .
( See the PDQ summary on Childhood Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Treatment for more information    .    )
The major types of lymphoma are Hodgkin lymphoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma    .
Lymphomas are divided into two general types : Hodgkin lymphoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma    .
This summary is about the treatment of adult non-Hodgkin lymphoma    .
For information about certain types of lymphoma , see the following PDQ summaries : - Adult Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Treatment ( lymphoblastic lymphoma ) - Adult Hodgkin Lymphoma Treatment - AIDS - Related Lymphoma Treatment - Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Treatment ( small lymphocytic lymphoma ) - Mycosis Fungoides and the Szary Syndrome Treatment ( cutaneous T - cell lymphoma ) - Primary CNS Lymphoma Treatment
Non-Hodgkin lymphoma can be indolent or aggressive    .
Non-Hodgkin lymphoma grows and spreads at different rates and can be indolent or aggressive    .
Indolent lymphoma tends to grow and spread slowly , and has few signs and symptoms    .
Aggressive lymphoma grows and spreads quickly , and has signs and symptoms that can be severe    .
The treatments for indolent and aggressive lymphoma are different    .
This summary is about the following types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma : Indolent non-Hodgkin lymphomas - Follicular lymphoma    .
Follicular lymphoma is the most common type of indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma    .
It is a very slow - growing type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that begins in B lymphocytes    .
It affects the lymph nodes and may spread to the bone marrow or spleen    .
Most patients with follicular lymphoma are age 50 years and older when they are diagnosed    .
Follicular lymphoma may go away without treatment    .
The patient is closely watched for signs or symptoms that the disease has come back    .
Treatment is needed if signs or symptoms occur after the cancer disappeared or after initial cancer treatment    .
Sometimes follicular lymphoma can become a more aggressive type of lymphoma , such as diffuse large B - cell lymphoma    .
- Lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma    .
In most cases of lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma , B lymphocytes that are turning into plasma cells make large amounts of a protein called monoclonal immunoglobulin M ( IgM ) antibody    .
High levels of IgM antibody in the blood cause the blood plasma to thicken    .
This may cause signs or symptoms such as trouble seeing or hearing , heart problems , shortness of breath , headache , dizziness , and numbness or tingling of the hands and feet    .
Sometimes there are no signs or symptoms of lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma    .
It may be found when a blood test is done for another reason    .
Lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma often spreads to the bone marrow , lymph nodes , and spleen    .
It is also called Waldenstrm macroglobulinemia    .
- Marginal zone lymphoma    .
This type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma begins in B lymphocytes in a part of lymph tissue called the marginal zone    .
There are five different types of marginal zone lymphoma    .
They are grouped by the type of tissue where the lymphoma formed : - Nodal marginal zone lymphoma    .
Nodal marginal zone lymphoma forms in lymph nodes    .
This type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma is rare    .
It is also called monocytoid B - cell lymphoma    .
- Gastric mucosa - associated lymphoid tissue ( MALT ) lymphoma    .
Gastric MALT lymphoma usually begins in the stomach    .
This type of marginal zone lymphoma forms in cells in the mucosa that help make antibodies    .
Patients with gastric MALT lymphoma may also have Helicobacter gastritis or an autoimmune disease , such as Hashimoto thyroiditis or Sjgren syndrome    .
- Extragastric MALT lymphoma    .
Extragastric MALT lymphoma begins outside of the stomach in almost every part of the body including other parts of the gastrointestinal tract , salivary glands , thyroid , lung , skin , and around the eye    .
This type of marginal zone lymphoma forms in cells in the mucosa that help make antibodies    .
Extragastric MALT lymphoma may come back many years after treatment    .
- Mediterranean abdominal lymphoma    .
This is a type of MALT lymphoma that occurs in young adults in eastern Mediterranean countries    .
It often forms in the abdomen and patients may also be infected with bacteria called Campylobacter jejuni    .
This type of lymphoma is also called immunoproliferative small intestinal disease    .
- Splenic marginal zone lymphoma    .
This type of marginal zone lymphoma begins in the spleen and may spread to the peripheral blood and bone marrow    .
The most common sign of this type of splenic marginal zone lymphoma is a spleen that is larger than normal    .
- Primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma    .
This type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma is in the skin only    .
It can be a benign ( not cancer ) nodule that may go away on its own or it can spread to many places on the skin and need treatment    .
Aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphomas - Diffuse large B - cell lymphoma    .
Diffuse large B - cell lymphoma is the most common type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma    .
It grows quickly in the lymph nodes and often the spleen , liver , bone marrow , or other organs are also affected    .
Signs and symptoms of diffuse large B - cell lymphoma may include fever , recurring night sweats , and weight loss    .
These are also called B symptoms    .
Primary mediastinal large B - cell lymphoma is a type of diffuse large B - cell lymphoma    .
- Primary mediastinal large B - cell lymphoma    .
This type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma is marked by the overgrowth of fibrous ( scar - like ) lymph tissue    .
A tumor most often forms behind the breastbone    .
It may press on the airways and cause coughing and trouble breathing    .
Most patients with primary mediastinal large B - cell lymphoma are women who are age 30 to 40 years    .
- Follicular large cell lymphoma , stage III    .
Follicular large cell lymphoma , stage III , is a very rare type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma    .
It is more like diffuse large B - cell lymphoma than other types of follicular lymphoma    .
- Anaplastic large cell lymphoma    .
Anaplastic large cell lymphoma is a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that usually begins in T lymphocytes    .
The cancer cells also have a marker called CD30 on the surface of the cell    .
There are two types of anaplastic large cell lymphoma : - Cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma    .
This type of anaplastic large cell lymphoma mostly affects the skin , but other parts of the body may also be affected    .
Signs of cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma include one or more bumps or ulcers on the skin    .
- Systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma    .
This type of anaplastic large cell lymphoma begins in the lymph nodes and may affect other parts of the body    .
Patients may have a lot of anaplastic lymphoma kinase ( ALK ) protein inside the lymphoma cells    .
These patients have a better prognosis than patients who do not have extra ALK protein    .
Systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma is more common in children than adults    .
( See the PDQ summary on Childhood Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Treatment for more information    .    ) - Extranodal NK -/T- cell lymphoma    .
Extranodal NK -/ T- cell lymphoma usually begins in the area around the nose    .
It may also affect the paranasal sinus ( hollow spaces in the bones around the nose ) , roof of the mouth , trachea , skin , stomach , and intestines    .
Most cases of extranodal NK -/ T - cell lymphoma have Epstein - Barr virus in the tumor cells    .
Sometimes hemophagocytic syndrome occurs ( a serious condition in which there are too many active histiocytes and T cells that cause severe inflammation in the body )    .
Treatment to suppress the immune system is needed    .
This type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma is not common in the United States    .
- Lymphomatoid granulomatosis    .
Lymphomatoid granulomatosis mostly affects the lungs    .
It may also affect the paranasal sinuses ( hollow spaces in the bones around the nose ) , skin , kidneys , and central nervous system    .
In lymphomatoid granulomatosis , cancer invades the blood vessels and kills tissue    .
Because the cancer may spread to the brain , intrathecal chemotherapy or radiation therapy to the brain is given    .
- Angioimmunoblastic T - cell lymphoma    .
This type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma begins in T cells    .
Swollen lymph nodes are a common sign    .
Other signs may include a skin rash , fever , weight loss , or night sweats    .
There may also be high levels of gamma globulin ( antibodies ) in the blood    .
Patients may also have opportunistic infections because their immune systems are weakened    .
- Peripheral T - cell lymphoma    .
Peripheral T - cell lymphoma begins in mature T lymphocytes    .
This type of T lymphocyte matures in the thymus gland and travels to other lymphatic sites in the body such as the lymph nodes , bone marrow , and spleen    .
There are three subtypes of peripheral T - cell lymphoma : - Hepatosplenic T - cell lymphoma    .
This is an uncommon type of peripheral T - cell lymphoma that occurs mostly in young men    .
It begins in the liver and spleen and the cancer cells also have a T - cell receptor called gamma / delta on the surface of the cell    .
- Subcutaneous panniculitis - like T - cell lymphoma    .
Subcutaneous panniculitis - like T - cell lymphoma begins in the skin or mucosa    .
It may occur with hemophagocytic syndrome ( a serious condition in which there are too many active histiocytes and T cells that cause severe inflammation in the body )    .
Treatment to suppress the immune system is needed    .
- Enteropathy - type intestinal T - cell lymphoma    .
This type of peripheral T - cell lymphoma occurs in the small bowel of patients with untreated celiac disease ( an immune response to gluten that causes malnutrition )    .
Patients who are diagnosed with celiac disease in childhood and stay on a gluten - free diet rarely develop enteropathy - type intestinal T - cell lymphoma    .
- Intravascular large B - cell lymphoma    .
This type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma affects blood vessels , especially the small blood vessels in the brain , kidney , lung , and skin    .
Signs and symptoms of intravascular large B - cell lymphoma are caused by blocked blood vessels    .
It is also called intravascular lymphomatosis    .
- Burkitt lymphoma    .
Burkitt lymphoma is a type of B - cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma that grows and spreads very quickly    .
It may affect the jaw , bones of the face , bowel , kidneys , ovaries , or other organs    .
There are three main types of Burkitt lymphoma ( endemic , sporadic , and immunodeficiency related )    .
Endemic Burkitt lymphoma commonly occurs in Africa and is linked to the Epstein - Barr virus , and sporadic Burkitt lymphoma occurs throughout the world    .
Immunodeficiency - related Burkitt lymphoma is most often seen in patients who have AIDS    .
Burkitt lymphoma may spread to the brain and spinal cord and treatment to prevent its spread may be given    .
Burkitt lymphoma occurs most often in children and young adults ( See the PDQ summary on Childhood Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Treatment for more information    .    )
Burkitt lymphoma is also called diffuse small noncleaved - cell lymphoma    .
- Lymphoblastic lymphoma    .
Lymphoblastic lymphoma may begin in T cells or B cells , but it usually begins in T cells    .
In this type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma , there are too many lymphoblasts ( immature white blood cells ) in the lymph nodes and the thymus gland    .
These lymphoblasts may spread to other places in the body , such as the bone marrow , brain , and spinal cord    .
Lymphoblastic lymphoma is most common in teenagers and young adults    .
It is a lot like acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( lymphoblasts are mostly found in the bone marrow and blood )    .
( See the PDQ summary on Adult Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Treatment for more information    .    ) - Adult T - cell leukemia / lymphoma    .
Adult T - cell leukemia / lymphoma is caused by the human T - cell leukemia virus type 1 ( HTLV - 1 )    .
Signs include bone and skin lesions , high blood calcium levels , and lymph nodes , spleen , and liver that are larger than normal    .
- Mantle cell lymphoma    .
Mantle cell lymphoma is a type of B - cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma that usually occurs in middle - aged or older adults    .
It begins in the lymph nodes and spreads to the spleen , bone marrow , blood , and sometimes the esophagus , stomach , and intestines    .
Patients with mantle cell lymphoma have too much of a protein called cyclin - D1 or a certain gene change in the lymphoma cells    .
In some patients who do not have signs or symptoms of lymphoma delaying the start of treatment does not affect the prognosis    .
- Posttransplantation lymphoproliferative disorder    .
This disease occurs in patients who have had a heart , lung , liver , kidney , or pancreas transplant and need lifelong immunosuppressive therapy    .
Most posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorders affect the B cells and have Epstein - Barr virus in the cells    .
Lymphoproliferative disorders are often treated like cancer    .    - True histiocytic lymphoma    .
This is a rare , very aggressive type of lymphoma    .
It is not known whether it begins in B cells or T cells    .
It does not respond well to treatment with standard chemotherapy    .
- Primary effusion lymphoma    .
Primary effusion lymphoma begins in B cells that are found in an area where there is a large build - up of fluid , such as the areas between the lining of the lung and chest wall ( pleural effusion ) , the sac around the heart and the heart ( pericardial effusion ) , or in the abdominal cavity    .
There is usually no tumor that can be seen    .
This type of lymphoma often occurs in patients who have AIDS    .
- Plasmablastic lymphoma    .
Plasmablastic lymphoma is a type of large B - cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma that is very aggressive    .
It is most often seen in patients with HIV infection    .
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Adult Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma ?
New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials    .
This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials    .
It may not mention every new treatment being studied    .
Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website    .
Vaccine therapy Vaccine therapy is a type of biologic therapy    .
Biologic therapy is a treatment that uses the patients immune system to fight cancer    .
Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost , direct , or restore the bodys natural defenses against cancer    .
This type of cancer treatment is also called biotherapy or immunotherapy    .
Vaccine therapy can also be a type of targeted therapy    .
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
For some patients , taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice    .
Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process    .
Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment    .
Many of today 's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials    .
Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment    .
Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future    .
Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments , they often answer important questions and help move research forward    .
Patients can enter clinical trials before , during , or after starting their cancer treatment    .
Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment    .
Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better    .
There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring ( coming back ) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment    .
Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country    .
See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials    .
These have been retrieved from NCI 's listing of clinical trials    .
Who is at risk for Adult Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma? ?
Age , gender , and a weakened immune system can affect the risk of adult non-Hodgkin lymphoma    .
Anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor    .
Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer ; not having risk factors doesnt mean that you will not get cancer    .
Talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk    .
These and other risk factors may increase the risk of certain types of adult non-Hodgkin lymphoma : - Being older , male , or white    .
- Having one of the following medical conditions : - An inherited immune disorder ( such as hypogammaglobulinemia or Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome )    .    - An autoimmune disease ( such as rheumatoid arthritis , psoriasis , or Sjgren syndrome )    .
- HIV / AIDS    .    - Human T- lymphotrophic virus type I or Epstein - Barr virus infection    .
- Helicobacter pylori infection    .
- Taking immunosuppressant drugs after an organ transplant    .
What are the symptoms of Adult Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma ?
Signs and symptoms of adult non-Hodgkin lymphoma include swelling in the lymph nodes , fever , night sweats , weight loss , and fatigue    .
These signs and symptoms may be caused by adult non-Hodgkin lymphoma or by other conditions    .
Check with your doctor if you have any of the following : - Swelling in the lymph nodes in the neck , underarm , groin , or stomach    .
- Fever for no known reason    .
- Recurring night sweats    .
- Feeling very tired    .
- Weight loss for no known reason    .
- Skin rash or itchy skin    .
- Pain in the chest , abdomen , or bones for no known reason    .
When fever , night sweats , and weight loss occur together , this group of symptoms is called B symptoms    .
Other signs and symptoms of adult non-Hodgkin lymphoma may occur and depend on the following : - Where the cancer forms in the body    .
- The size of the tumor    .
- How fast the tumor grows    .
How to diagnose Adult Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma ?
Tests that examine the body and lymph system are used to help detect ( find ) and diagnose adult non-Hodgkin lymphoma    .
The following tests and procedures may be used : - Physical exam and history :
An exam of the body to check general signs of health , including checking for signs of disease , such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual    .
A history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken    .
- Flow cytometry :
A laboratory test that measures the number of cells in a sample , the percentage of live cells in a sample , and certain characteristics of cells , such as size , shape , and the presence of tumor markers on the cell surface    .
The cells are stained with a light - sensitive dye , placed in a fluid , and passed in a stream before a laser or other type of light    .
The measurements are based on how the light - sensitive dye reacts to the light    .
This test is used to diagnose lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma    .
- Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy :
The removal of bone marrow and a small piece of bone by inserting a needle into the hipbone or breastbone    .
A pathologist views the bone marrow and bone under a microscope to look for signs of cancer    .
- Lymph node biopsy :
The removal of all or part of a lymph node    .
A pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells    .
One of the following types of biopsies may be done : - Excisional biopsy :
The removal of an entire lymph node    .
- Incisional biopsy :
The removal of part of a lymph node    .
- Core biopsy :
The removal of part of a lymph node using a wide needle    .
- Fine - needle aspiration ( FNA ) biopsy :
The removal of tissue or fluid using a thin needle    .
- Laparoscopy : A surgical procedure to look at the organs inside the abdomen to check for signs of disease    .
Small incisions ( cuts ) are made in the wall of the abdomen and a laparoscope ( a thin , lighted tube ) is inserted into one of the incisions    .
Other instruments may be inserted through the same or other incisions to take tissue samples to be checked under a microscope for signs of disease    .
- Laparotomy : A surgical procedure in which an incision ( cut ) is made in the wall of the abdomen to check the inside of the abdomen for signs of disease    .
Tissue samples are taken and checked under a microscope for signs of disease    .
If cancer is found , the following tests may be done to study the cancer cells : - Immunohistochemistry :
A test that uses antibodies to check for certain antigens in a sample of tissue    .
The antibody is usually linked to a radioactive substance or a dye that causes the tissue to light up under a microscope    .
This type of test may be used to tell the difference between different types of cancer    .
- Cytogenetic analysis :
A laboratory test in which cells in a sample of tissue are viewed under a microscope to look for certain changes in the chromosomes    .
- FISH ( fluorescence in situ hybridization ) : A laboratory test used to look at genes or chromosomes in cells and tissues    .
Pieces of DNA that contain a fluorescent dye are made in the laboratory and added to cells or tissues on a glass slide    .
When these pieces of DNA attach to certain genes or areas of chromosomes on the slide , they light up when viewed under a microscope with a special light    .
This type of test is used to look for certain genetic markers    .
- Immunophenotyping :
A process used to identify cells , based on the types of antigens or markers on the surface of the cell    .
This process is used to diagnose specific types of leukemia and lymphoma by comparing the cancer cells to normal cells of the immune system    .
Other tests and procedures may be done depending on the signs and symptoms seen and where the cancer forms in the body    .
What is the outlook for Adult Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma ?
Certain factors affect prognosis ( chance of recovery ) and treatment options    .
The prognosis ( chance of recovery ) and treatment options depend on the following : - The stage of the cancer    .    - The type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma    .    - The amount of lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH ) in the blood    .
- Whether there are certain changes in the genes    .
- The patients age and general health    .
- Whether the lymphoma has just been diagnosed or has recurred ( come back )    .
For non-Hodgkin lymphoma during pregnancy , the treatment options also depend on : - The wishes of the patient    .
- Which trimester of pregnancy the patient is in    .
- Whether the baby can be delivered early    .
Some types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma spread more quickly than others do    .
Most non-Hodgkin lymphomas that occur during pregnancy are aggressive    .
Delaying treatment of aggressive lymphoma until after the baby is born may lessen the mother 's chance of survival    .
Immediate treatment is often recommended , even during pregnancy    .
What are the stages of Adult Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma ?
Key Points
- After adult non-Hodgkin lymphoma has been diagnosed , tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the lymph system or to other parts of the body    .
- There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body    .
- Stages of adult non-Hodgkin lymphoma may include E and S   .    - The following stages are used for adult non-Hodgkin lymphoma : - Stage I - Stage II - Stage III - Stage IV - Adult non-Hodgkin lymphomas may be grouped for treatment according to whether the cancer is indolent or aggressive and whether affected lymph nodes are next to each other in the body    .
After adult non-Hodgkin lymphoma has been diagnosed , tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the lymph system or to other parts of the body    .
The process used to find out the type of cancer and if cancer cells have spread within the lymph system or to other parts of the body is called staging    .
The information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease    .
It is important to know the stage of the disease in order to plan treatment    .
The results of the tests and procedures done to diagnose non-Hodgkin lymphoma are used to help make decisions about treatment    .
The following tests and procedures may also be used in the staging process : - Complete blood count ( CBC ) with differential :
A procedure in which a sample of blood is drawn and checked for the following : - The number of red blood cells and platelets    .
- The number and type of white blood cells    .
- The amount of hemoglobin ( the protein that carries oxygen ) in the red blood cells    .
- The portion of the blood sample made up of red blood cells    .
- Blood chemistry studies :
A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body    .
An unusual ( higher or lower than normal ) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease    .
- CT scan ( CAT scan ) : A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body , such as the lung , lymph nodes , and liver , taken from different angles    .
The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine    .
A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly    .
This procedure is also called computed tomography , computerized tomography , or computerized axial tomography    .
- PET scan ( positron emission tomography scan ) : A procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body    .
A small amount of radioactive glucose ( sugar ) is injected into a vein    .
The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body    .
Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do    .
- MRI ( magnetic resonance imaging ) : A procedure that uses a magnet , radio waves , and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body    .
This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging ( NMRI )    .
- Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy :
The removal of bone marrow and a small piece of bone by inserting a needle into the hipbone or breastbone    .
A pathologist views the bone marrow and bone under a microscope to look for signs of cancer    .
- Lumbar puncture : A procedure used to collect cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) from the spinal column    .
The sample of CSF is checked under a microscope for signs that the cancer has spread to the brain and spinal cord    .
This procedure is also called an LP or spinal tap    .
For pregnant women with non-Hodgkin lymphoma , staging tests and procedures that protect the baby from the harms of radiation are used    .
These tests and procedures include MRI , bone marrow aspiration and biopsy , lumbar puncture , and ultrasound    .
An ultrasound exam is a procedure in which high - energy sound waves ( ultrasound ) are bounced off internal tissues or organs and make echoes    .
The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram    .
There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body    .
Cancer can spread through tissue , the lymph system , and the blood : - Tissue    .
The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas    .
- Lymph system    .
The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system    .
The cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body    .
- Blood    .
The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood    .
The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body    .
Stages of adult non-Hodgkin lymphoma may include E and S    .
Adult non-Hodgkin lymphoma may be described as follows : - E : &quot ; E&quot ; stands for extranodal and means the cancer is found in an area or organ other than the lymph nodes or has spread to tissues beyond , but near , the major lymphatic areas    .
- S : &quot ; S&quot ; stands for spleen and means the cancer is found in the spleen    .
The following stages are used for adult non-Hodgkin lymphoma :
Stage I Stage I adult non-Hodgkin lymphoma is divided into stage I and stage IE    .
- Stage I : Cancer is found in one lymphatic area ( lymph node group , tonsils and nearby tissue , thymus , or spleen )    .
- Stage IE : Cancer is found in one organ or area outside the lymph nodes    .
Stage II Stage II adult non-Hodgkin lymphoma is divided into stage II and stage IIE    .
- Stage II : Cancer is found in two or more lymph node groups either above or below the diaphragm ( the thin muscle below the lungs that helps breathing and separates the chest from the abdomen )    .
- Stage IIE : Cancer is found in one or more lymph node groups either above or below the diaphragm    .
Cancer is also found outside the lymph nodes in one organ or area on the same side of the diaphragm as the affected lymph nodes    .
Stage III Stage III adult non-Hodgkin lymphoma is divided into stage III , stage IIIE , stage IIIS , and stage IIIE+S   .    - Stage III : Cancer is found in lymph node groups above and below the diaphragm ( the thin muscle below the lungs that helps breathing and separates the chest from the abdomen )    .
- Stage IIIE : Cancer is found in lymph node groups above and below the diaphragm and outside the lymph nodes in a nearby organ or area    .
- Stage IIIS : Cancer is found in lymph node groups above and below the diaphragm , and in the spleen    .
- Stage IIIE+S : Cancer is found in lymph node groups above and below the diaphragm , outside the lymph nodes in a nearby organ or area , and in the spleen    .
Stage IV
In stage IV adult non-Hodgkin lymphoma , the cancer : - is found throughout one or more organs that are not part of a lymphatic area ( lymph node group , tonsils and nearby tissue , thymus , or spleen ) , and may be in lymph nodes near those organs ; or - is found in one organ that is not part of a lymphatic area and has spread to organs or lymph nodes far away from that organ ; or - is found in the liver , bone marrow , cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) , or lungs ( other than cancer that has spread to the lungs from nearby areas )    .
Adult non-Hodgkin lymphomas may be grouped for treatment according to whether the cancer is indolent or aggressive and whether affected lymph nodes are next to each other in the body    .
See the General Information section for more information on the types of indolent ( slow - growing ) and aggressive ( fast - growing ) non-Hodgkin lymphoma    .
Non-Hodgkin lymphoma can also be described as contiguous or noncontiguous : - Contiguous lymphomas : Lymphomas in which the lymph nodes with cancer are next to each other    .
- Noncontiguous lymphomas : Lymphomas in which the lymph nodes with cancer are not next to each other , but are on the same side of the diaphragm    .
What are the treatments for Adult Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma ?
Key Points
- There are different types of treatment for patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma    .
- Patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma should have their treatment planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating lymphomas    .
- Patients may develop late effects that appear months or years after their treatment for non-Hodgkin lymphoma    .
- Nine types of standard treatment are used : - Radiation therapy - Chemotherapy - Immunotherapy - Targeted therapy - Plasmapheresis - Watchful waiting - Antibiotic therapy - Surgery - Stem cell transplant - New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials    .
- Vaccine therapy - Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
- Patients can enter clinical trials before , during , or after starting their cancer treatment    .
- Follow - up tests may be needed    .
There are different types of treatment for patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma    .
Different types of treatment are available for patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma    .
Some treatments are standard ( the currently used treatment ) , and some are being tested in clinical trials    .
A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer    .
When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment , the new treatment may become the standard treatment    .
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment    .
For pregnant women with non-Hodgkin lymphoma , treatment is carefully chosen to protect the baby    .
Treatment decisions are based on the mothers wishes , the stage of the non-Hodgkin lymphoma , and the age of the baby    .
The treatment plan may change as the signs and symptoms , cancer , and pregnancy change    .
Choosing the most appropriate cancer treatment is a decision that ideally involves the patient , family , and health care team    .
Patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma should have their treatment planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating lymphomas    .
Treatment will be overseen by a medical oncologist , a doctor who specializes in treating cancer , or a hematologist , a doctor who specializes in treating blood cancers    .
The medical oncologist may refer you to other health care providers who have experience and are experts in treating adult non-Hodgkin lymphoma and who specialize in certain areas of medicine    .
These may include the following specialists : - Neurosurgeon    .    - Neurologist    .    - Radiation oncologist    .
- Endocrinologist    .
- Rehabilitation specialist    .    - Other oncology specialists    .
Patients may develop late effects that appear months or years after their treatment for non-Hodgkin lymphoma    .
Side effects from cancer treatment that begin during or after treatment and continue for months or years are called late effects    .
Treatment with chemotherapy , radiation therapy , or stem cell transplant for non-Hodgkin lymphoma may increase the risk of late effects    .
Late effects of cancer treatment may include the following : - Heart problems    .
- Infertility ( inability to have children )    .
- Loss of bone density    .
- Neuropathy ( nerve damage that causes numbness or trouble walking )    .    - A second cancer , such as : - Lung cancer    .    - Brain cancer    .    - Kidney cancer    .    - Bladder cancer    .    - Melanoma    .    - Hodgkin lymphoma    .    - Myelodysplastic syndrome    .    - Acute myeloid leukemia    .
Some late effects may be treated or controlled    .
It is important to talk with your doctor about the effects cancer treatment can have on you    .
Regular follow - up to check for late effects is important    .
Nine types of standard treatment are used :
Radiation therapy Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high - energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing    .
There are two types of radiation therapy : - External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer    .
- Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles , seeds , wires , or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer    .
Total - body irradiation is a type of external radiation therapy that is given to the entire body    .
It may be given before a stem cell transplant    .
The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated    .
External radiation therapy is used to treat adult non-Hodgkin lymphoma , and may also be used as palliative therapy to relieve symptoms and improve quality of life    .
For pregnant women with non-Hodgkin lymphoma , radiation therapy should be given after delivery , if possible , to avoid any risk to the baby    .
If treatment is needed right away , pregnant women may decide to continue the pregnancy and receive radiation therapy    .
However , lead used to shield the baby may not protect it from scattered radiation that could possibly cause cancer in the future    .
Chemotherapy Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells , either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing    .
When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle , the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body ( systemic chemotherapy )    .
When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid ( intrathecal chemotherapy ) , an organ , or a body cavity such as the abdomen , the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas ( regional chemotherapy )    .
Combination chemotherapy is treatment using two or more anticancer drugs    .
Steroid drugs may be added , to lessen inflammation and lower the body 's immune response    .
The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated    .
Intrathecal chemotherapy may also be used in the treatment of lymphoma that first forms in the testicles or sinuses ( hollow areas ) around the nose , diffuse large B - cell lymphoma , Burkitt lymphoma , lymphoblastic lymphoma , and some aggressive T - cell lymphomas    .
It is given to lessen the chance that lymphoma cells will spread to the brain and spinal cord    .
This is called CNS prophylaxis    .
In pregnant women , the baby is exposed to chemotherapy when the mother is treated , and some anticancer drugs cause birth defects    .
Because anticancer drugs are passed to the baby through the mother , both must be watched closely when chemotherapy is given    .
See Drugs Approved for Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma for more information    .
Immunotherapy Immunotherapy is a treatment that uses the patients immune system to fight cancer    .
Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost , direct , or restore the bodys natural defenses against cancer    .
Immunomodulators are a type of immunotherapy    .
Lenalidomide is an immunomodulator used to treat adult non-Hodgkin lymphoma    .
See Drugs Approved for Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma for more information    .
Targeted therapy Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells    .
Monoclonal antibody therapy , proteasome inhibitor therapy , and kinase inhibitor therapy are types of targeted therapy used to treat adult non-Hodgkin lymphoma    .
Monoclonal antibody therapy is a cancer treatment that uses antibodies made in the laboratory from a single type of immune system cell    .
These antibodies can identify substances on cancer cells or normal substances that may help cancer cells grow    .
The antibodies attach to the substances and kill the cancer cells , block their growth , or keep them from spreading    .
They may be used alone or to carry drugs , toxins , or radioactive material directly to cancer cells    .
Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody used to treat many types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma    .
Monoclonal antibodies that have been joined to radioactive material are called radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies    .
Yttrium Y 90 - ibritumomab tiuxetan is an example of a radiolabeled monoclonal antibody    .
Monoclonal antibodies are given by infusion    .
Proteasome inhibitor therapy blocks the action of proteasomes in cancer cells and may prevent the growth of tumors    .
Kinase inhibitor therapy , such as idelalisib , blocks certain proteins , which may help keep lymphoma cells from growing and may kill them    .
It is used to treat indolent lymphoma    .
Ibrutinib , a type of Bruton 's tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy , is used to treat lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma and mantle cell lymphoma    .
See Drugs Approved for Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma for more information    .
Plasmapheresis
If the blood becomes thick with extra antibody proteins and affects circulation , plasmapheresis is done to remove extra plasma and antibody proteins from the blood    .
In this procedure , blood is removed from the patient and sent through a machine that separates the plasma ( the liquid part of the blood ) from the blood cells    .
The patient 's plasma contains the unneeded antibodies and is not returned to the patient    .
The normal blood cells are returned to the bloodstream along with donated plasma or a plasma replacement    .
Plasmapheresis does not keep new antibodies from forming    .
Watchful waiting Watchful waiting is closely monitoring a patients condition without giving any treatment until signs or symptoms appear or change    .
Antibiotic therapy Antibiotic therapy is a treatment that uses drugs to treat infections and cancer caused by bacteria and other microorganisms    .
See Drugs Approved for Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma for more information    .
Surgery Surgery may be used to remove the lymphoma in certain patients with indolent or aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma    .
The type of surgery used depends on where the lymphoma formed in the body : - Local excision for certain patients with mucosa - associated lymphoid tissue ( MALT ) lymphoma , PTLD , and small bowel T - cell lymphoma    .
- Splenectomy for patients with marginal zone lymphoma of the spleen    .
Patients who have a heart , lung , liver , kidney , or pancreas transplant usually need to take drugs to suppress their immune system for the rest of their lives    .
Long - term immunosuppression after an organ transplant can cause a certain type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma called post - transplant lymphoproliferative disorder ( PLTD )    .
Small bowel surgery is often needed to diagnose celiac disease in adults who develop a type of T - cell lymphoma    .
Stem cell transplant
Stem cell transplant is a method of giving high doses of chemotherapy and / or total - body irradiation and then replacing blood - forming cells destroyed by the cancer treatment    .
Stem cells ( immature blood cells ) are removed from the blood or bone marrow of the patient ( autologous transplant ) or a donor ( allogeneic transplant ) and are frozen and stored    .
After the chemotherapy and / or radiation therapy is completed , the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion    .
These reinfused stem cells grow into ( and restore ) the bodys blood cells    .
New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials    .
This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials    .
It may not mention every new treatment being studied    .
Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website    .
Vaccine therapy Vaccine therapy is a type of biologic therapy    .
Biologic therapy is a treatment that uses the patients immune system to fight cancer    .
Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost , direct , or restore the bodys natural defenses against cancer    .
This type of cancer treatment is also called biotherapy or immunotherapy    .
Vaccine therapy can also be a type of targeted therapy    .
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
For some patients , taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice    .
Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process    .
Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment    .
Many of today 's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials    .
Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment    .
Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future    .
Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments , they often answer important questions and help move research forward    .
Patients can enter clinical trials before , during , or after starting their cancer treatment    .
Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment    .
Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better    .
There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring ( coming back ) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment    .
Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country    .
See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials    .
These have been retrieved from NCI 's listing of clinical trials    .
Follow - up tests may be needed    .
Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated    .
Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working    .
Decisions about whether to continue , change , or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests    .
Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended    .
The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred ( come back )    .
These tests are sometimes called follow - up tests or check - ups    .
Treatment Options for Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma During Pregnancy
Indolent Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma During Pregnancy
Women who have indolent ( slow - growing ) non-Hodgkin lymphoma during pregnancy may be treated with watchful waiting until after they give birth    .
( See the Treatment Options for Indolent Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma section for more information    .    )
Aggressive Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma During Pregnancy
Treatment of aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma during pregnancy may include the following : - Treatment given right away based on the type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma to increase the mother 's chance of survival    .
Treatment may include combination chemotherapy and rituximab    .
- Early delivery of the baby followed by treatment based on the type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma    .    - If in the first trimester of pregnancy , medical oncologists may advise ending the pregnancy so that treatment may begin    .
Treatment depends on the type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma    .
What is (are) AIDS-Related Lymphoma ?
Key Points
- AIDS - related lymphoma is a disease in which malignant ( cancer ) cells form in the lymph system of patients who have acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS )    .
- There are many different types of lymphoma    .
- Signs of AIDS - related lymphoma include weight loss , fever , and night sweats    .
- Tests that examine the lymph system and other parts of the body are used to help detect ( find ) and diagnose AIDS - related lymphoma    .
- Certain factors affect prognosis ( chance of recovery ) and treatment options    .
AIDS - related lymphoma is a disease in which malignant ( cancer ) cells form in the lymph system of patients who have acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS )    .
AIDS is caused by the human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) , which attacks and weakens the body 's immune system    .
The immune system is then unable to fight infection and disease    .
People with HIV disease have an increased risk of infection and lymphoma or other types of cancer    .
A person with HIV disease who develops certain types of infections or cancer is then diagnosed with AIDS    .
Sometimes , people are diagnosed with AIDS and AIDS - related lymphoma at the same time    .
For information about AIDS and its treatment , please see the AIDSinfo website    .
AIDS - related lymphoma is a type of cancer that affects the lymph system , which is part of the body 's immune system    .
The immune system protects the body from foreign substances , infection , and diseases    .
The lymph system is made up of the following : - Lymph : Colorless , watery fluid that carries white blood cells called lymphocytes through the lymph system    .
Lymphocytes protect the body against infections and the growth of tumors    .
- Lymph vessels : A network of thin tubes that collect lymph from different parts of the body and return it to the bloodstream    .
- Lymph nodes : Small , bean - shaped structures that filter lymph and store white blood cells that help fight infection and disease    .
Lymph nodes are located along the network of lymph vessels found throughout the body    .
Clusters of lymph nodes are found in the neck , underarm , abdomen , pelvis , and groin    .
- Spleen :
An organ that makes lymphocytes , filters the blood , stores blood cells , and destroys old blood cells    .
The spleen is on the left side of the abdomen near the stomach    .
- Thymus :
An organ in which lymphocytes grow and multiply    .
The thymus is in the chest behind the breastbone    .
- Tonsils :
Two small masses of lymph tissue at the back of the throat    .
The tonsils make lymphocytes    .
- Bone marrow :
The soft , spongy tissue in the center of large bones    .
Bone marrow makes white blood cells , red blood cells , and platelets    .
Lymph tissue is also found in other parts of the body such as the brain , stomach , thyroid gland , and skin    .
Sometimes AIDS - related lymphoma occurs outside the lymph nodes in the bone marrow , liver , meninges ( thin membranes that cover the brain ) and gastrointestinal tract    .
Less often , it may occur in the anus , heart , bile duct , gingiva , and muscles    .
There are many different types of lymphoma    .
Lymphomas are divided into two general types : - Hodgkin lymphoma    .    - Non-Hodgkin lymphoma    .
Both Hodgkin lymphoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma may occur in patients with AIDS , but non-Hodgkin lymphoma is more common    .
When a person with AIDS has non-Hodgkin lymphoma , it is called AIDS - related lymphoma    .
When AIDS - related lymphoma occurs in the central nervous system ( CNS ) , it is called AIDS - related primary CNS lymphoma    .
Non-Hodgkin lymphomas are grouped by the way their cells look under a microscope    .
They may be indolent ( slow - growing ) or aggressive ( fast - growing )    .
AIDS - related lymphomas are aggressive    .
There are two main types of AIDS - related non-Hodgkin lymphoma : - Diffuse large B - cell lymphoma ( including B- cell immunoblastic lymphoma )    .
- Burkitt or Burkitt - like lymphoma    .
For more information about lymphoma or AIDS - related cancers , see the following PDQ summaries : - Adult Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Treatment - Childhood Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Treatment - Primary CNS Lymphoma Treatment - Kaposi Sarcoma Treatment
What are the symptoms of AIDS-Related Lymphoma ?
Signs of AIDS - related lymphoma include weight loss , fever , and night sweats    .
These and other signs and symptoms may be caused by AIDS - related lymphoma or by other conditions    .
Check with your doctor if you have any of the following : - Weight loss or fever for no known reason    .
- Night sweats    .
- Painless , swollen lymph nodes in the neck , chest , underarm , or groin    .    - A feeling of fullness below the ribs    .
How to diagnose AIDS-Related Lymphoma ?
Tests that examine the lymph system and other parts of the body are used to help detect ( find ) and diagnose AIDS - related lymphoma    .
The following tests and procedures may be used : - Physical exam and history :
An exam of the body to check general signs of health , including checking for signs of disease , such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual    .
A history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken    .
- Complete blood count ( CBC ) : A procedure in which a sample of blood is drawn and checked for the following : - The number of red blood cells , white blood cells , and platelets    .
- The amount of hemoglobin ( the protein that carries oxygen ) in the red blood cells    .
- The portion of the sample made up of red blood cells    .
- HIV test :
A test to measure the level of HIV antibodies in a sample of blood    .
Antibodies are made by the body when it is invaded by a foreign substance    .
A high level of HIV antibodies may mean the body has been infected with HIV    .
- Lymph node biopsy :
The removal of all or part of a lymph node    .
A pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells    .
One of the following types of biopsies may be done : - Excisional biopsy :
The removal of an entire lymph node    .
- Incisional biopsy :
The removal of part of a lymph node    .
- Core biopsy :
The removal of tissue from a lymph node using a wide needle    .
- Fine - needle aspiration ( FNA ) biopsy :
The removal of tissue from a lymph node using a thin needle    .
- Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy :
The removal of bone marrow and a small piece of bone by inserting a hollow needle into the hipbone or breastbone    .
A pathologist views the bone marrow and bone under a microscope to look for signs of cancer    .
- Chest x-ray :
An x-ray of the organs and bones inside the chest    .
An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film , making a picture of areas inside the body    .
What is the outlook for AIDS-Related Lymphoma ?
Certain factors affect prognosis ( chance of recovery ) and treatment options    .
The prognosis ( chance of recovery ) and treatment options depend on the following : - The stage of the cancer    .    - The age of the patient    .    - The number of CD4 lymphocytes ( a type of white blood cell ) in the blood    .
- The number of places in the body lymphoma is found outside the lymph system    .
- Whether the patient has a history of intravenous ( IV ) drug use    .
- The patient 's ability to carry out regular daily activities    .
What are the stages of AIDS-Related Lymphoma ?
Key Points
- After AIDS - related lymphoma has been diagnosed , tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the lymph system or to other parts of the body    .
- There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body    .
- Stages of AIDS - related lymphoma may include E and S   .    - The following stages are used for AIDS - related lymphoma : - Stage I - Stage II - Stage III - Stage IV - For treatment , AIDS - related lymphomas are grouped based on where they started in the body , as follows : - Peripheral / systemic lymphoma - Primary CNS lymphoma
After AIDS - related lymphoma has been diagnosed , tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the lymph system or to other parts of the body    .
The process used to find out if cancer cells have spread within the lymph system or to other parts of the body is called staging    .
The information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease    .
It is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment , but AIDS - related lymphoma is usually advanced when it is diagnosed    .
The following tests and procedures may be used in the staging process : - Blood chemistry studies :
A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body    .
An unusual ( higher or lower than normal ) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease    .
The blood sample will be checked for the level of LDH ( lactate dehydrogenase )    .
- CT scan ( CAT scan ) : A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body , such as the lung , lymph nodes , and liver , taken from different angles    .
The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine    .
A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly    .
This procedure is also called computed tomography , computerized tomography , or computerized axial tomography    .
- PET scan ( positron emission tomography scan ) : A procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body    .
A small amount of radioactive glucose ( sugar ) is injected into a vein    .
The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body    .
Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do    .
- MRI ( magnetic resonance imaging ) with gadolinium :
A procedure that uses a magnet , radio waves , and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body    .
A substance called gadolinium is injected into the patient through a vein    .
The gadolinium collects around the cancer cells so they show up brighter in the picture    .
This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging ( NMRI )    .
This is done by placing a needle between two bones in the spine and into the CSF around the spinal cord and removing a sample of the fluid    .
The sample of CSF is checked under a microscope for signs that the cancer has spread to the brain and spinal cord    .
The sample may also be checked for Epstein - Barr virus    .
This procedure is also called an LP or spinal tap    .
There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body    .
Cancer can spread through tissue , the lymph system , and the blood : - Tissue    .
The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas    .
- Lymph system    .
The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system    .
The cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body    .
- Blood    .
The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood    .
The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body    .
Stages of AIDS - related lymphoma may include E and S    .
AIDS - related lymphoma may be described as follows : - E : &quot ; E&quot ; stands for extranodal and means the cancer is found in an area or organ other than the lymph nodes or has spread to tissues beyond , but near , the major lymphatic areas    .
- S : &quot ; S&quot ; stands for spleen and means the cancer is found in the spleen    .
The following stages are used for AIDS - related lymphoma :
Stage I Stage I AIDS - related lymphoma is divided into stage I and stage IE    .
- Stage I : Cancer is found in one lymphatic area ( lymph node group , tonsils and nearby tissue , thymus , or spleen )    .
- Stage IE : Cancer is found in one organ or area outside the lymph nodes    .
Stage II Stage II AIDS - related lymphoma is divided into stage II and stage IIE    .
- Stage II : Cancer is found in two or more lymph node groups either above or below the diaphragm ( the thin muscle below the lungs that helps breathing and separates the chest from the abdomen )    .
- Stage IIE : Cancer is found in one or more lymph node groups either above or below the diaphragm    .
Cancer is also found outside the lymph nodes in one organ or area on the same side of the diaphragm as the affected lymph nodes    .
Stage III Stage III AIDS - related lymphoma is divided into stage III , stage IIIE , stage IIIS , and stage IIIE+S   .    - Stage III : Cancer is found in lymph node groups above and below the diaphragm ( the thin muscle below the lungs that helps breathing and separates the chest from the abdomen )    .
- Stage IIIE : Cancer is found in lymph node groups above and below the diaphragm and outside the lymph nodes in a nearby organ or area    .
- Stage IIIS : Cancer is found in lymph node groups above and below the diaphragm , and in the spleen    .
- Stage IIIE+S : Cancer is found in lymph node groups above and below the diaphragm , outside the lymph nodes in a nearby organ or area , and in the spleen    .
Stage IV
In stage IV AIDS - related lymphoma , the cancer : - is found throughout one or more organs that are not part of a lymphatic area ( lymph node group , tonsils and nearby tissue , thymus , or spleen ) and may be in lymph nodes near those organs ; or - is found in one organ that is not part of a lymphatic area and has spread to organs or lymph nodes far away from that organ ; or - is found in the liver , bone marrow , cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) , or lungs ( other than cancer that has spread to the lungs from nearby areas )    .
Patients who are infected with the Epstein - Barr virus or whose AIDS - related lymphoma affects the bone marrow have an increased risk of the cancer spreading to the central nervous system ( CNS )    .
For treatment , AIDS - related lymphomas are grouped based on where they started in the body , as follows :
Peripheral / systemic lymphoma Lymphoma that starts in the lymph system or elsewhere in the body , other than the brain , is called peripheral / systemic lymphoma    .
It may spread throughout the body , including to the brain or bone marrow    .
It is often diagnosed in an advanced stage    .
Primary CNS lymphoma Primary CNS lymphoma starts in the central nervous system ( brain and spinal cord )    .
It is linked to the Epstein - Barr virus    .
Lymphoma that starts somewhere else in the body and spreads to the central nervous system is not primary CNS lymphoma    .
What are the treatments for AIDS-Related Lymphoma ?
Key Points
- There are different types of treatment for patients with AIDS - related lymphoma    .
- Treatment of AIDS - related lymphoma combines treatment of the lymphoma with treatment for AIDS    .
- Four types of standard treatment are used : - Chemotherapy - Radiation therapy - High - dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant - Targeted therapy - New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials    .
- Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
- Patients can enter clinical trials before , during , or after starting their cancer treatment    .
- Follow - up tests may be needed    .
There are different types of treatment for patients with AIDS - related lymphoma    .
Different types of treatment are available for patients with AIDS - related lymphoma    .
Some treatments are standard ( the currently used treatment ) , and some are being tested in clinical trials    .
A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer    .
When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment , the new treatment may become the standard treatment    .
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment    .
Treatment of AIDS - related lymphoma combines treatment of the lymphoma with treatment for AIDS    .
Patients with AIDS have weakened immune systems and treatment can cause the immune system to become even weaker    .
For this reason , treating patients who have AIDS - related lymphoma is difficult and some patients may be treated with lower doses of drugs than lymphoma patients who do not have AIDS    .
Combined antiretroviral therapy ( cART ) is used to lessen the damage to the immune system caused by HIV    .
Treatment with combined antiretroviral therapy may allow some patients with AIDS - related lymphoma to safely receive anticancer drugs in standard or higher doses    .
In these patients , treatment may work as well as it does in lymphoma patients who do not have AIDS    .
Medicine to prevent and treat infections , which can be serious , is also used    .
For more information about AIDS and its treatment , please see the AIDSinfo website    .
Four types of standard treatment are used :
Chemotherapy Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells , either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing    .
When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle , the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body ( systemic chemotherapy )    .
When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid ( intrathecal chemotherapy ) , an organ , or a body cavity such as the abdomen , the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas ( regional chemotherapy )    .
Combination chemotherapy is treatment using more than one anticancer drug    .
The way the chemotherapy is given depends on where the cancer has formed    .
Intrathecal chemotherapy may be used in patients who are more likely to have lymphoma in the central nervous system ( CNS )    .
Chemotherapy is used in the treatment of AIDS - related peripheral / systemic lymphoma    .
It is not yet known whether it is best to give combined antiretroviral therapy at the same time as chemotherapy or after chemotherapy ends    .
Colony - stimulating factors are sometimes given together with chemotherapy    .
This helps lessen the side effects chemotherapy may have on the bone marrow    .
Radiation therapy Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high - energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing    .
There are two types of radiation therapy : - External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer    .
- Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles , seeds , wires , or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer    .
The way the radiation therapy is given depends on where the cancer has formed    .
External radiation therapy is used to treat AIDS - related primary CNS lymphoma    .
High - dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant High - dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant is a way of giving high doses of chemotherapy and replacing blood - forming cells destroyed by the cancer treatment    .
Stem cells ( immature blood cells ) are removed from the blood or bone marrow of the patient or a donor and are frozen and stored    .
After the chemotherapy is completed , the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion    .
These reinfused stem cells grow into ( and restore ) the body 's blood cells    .
Targeted therapy Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells    .
Monoclonal antibody therapy is a type of targeted therapy    .
Monoclonal antibody therapy is a cancer treatment that uses antibodies made in the laboratory from a single type of immune system cell    .
These antibodies can identify substances on cancer cells or normal substances that may help cancer cells grow    .
The antibodies attach to the substances and kill the cancer cells , block their growth , or keep them from spreading    .
Monoclonal antibodies are given by infusion    .
These may be used alone or to carry drugs , toxins , or radioactive material directly to cancer cells    .
Rituximab is used in the treatment of AIDS - related peripheral / systemic lymphoma    .
New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials    .
Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website    .
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
For some patients , taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice    .
Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process    .
Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment    .
Many of today 's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials    .
Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment    .
Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future    .
Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments , they often answer important questions and help move research forward    .
Patients can enter clinical trials before , during , or after starting their cancer treatment    .
Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment    .
Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better    .
There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring ( coming back ) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment    .
Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country    .
See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials    .
These have been retrieved from NCI 's listing of clinical trials    .
Follow - up tests may be needed    .
Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated    .
Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working    .
Decisions about whether to continue , change , or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests    .
Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended    .
The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred ( come back )    .
These tests are sometimes called follow - up tests or check - ups    .

What is (are) Mycosis Fungoides and the Szary Syndrome ?
Key Points
- Mycosis fungoides and the Szary syndrome are diseases in which lymphocytes ( a type of white blood cell ) become malignant ( cancerous ) and affect the skin    .
- Mycosis fungoides and the Szary syndrome are types of cutaneous T - cell lymphoma    .    - A sign of mycosis fungoides is a red rash on the skin    .
- In the Szary syndrome , cancerous T - cells are found in the blood    .
- Tests that examine the skin and blood are used to detect ( find ) and diagnose mycosis fungoides and the Szary syndrome    .
- Certain factors affect prognosis ( chance of recovery ) and treatment options    .
Mycosis fungoides and the Szary syndrome are diseases in which lymphocytes ( a type of white blood cell ) become malignant ( cancerous ) and affect the skin    .
Normally , the bone marrow makes blood stem cells ( immature cells ) that become mature blood stem cells over time    .
A blood stem cell may become a myeloid stem cell or a lymphoid stem cell    .
A myeloid stem cell becomes a red blood cell , white blood cell , or platelet    .
A lymphoid stem cell becomes a lymphoblast and then one of three types of lymphocytes ( white blood cells ) : - B-cell lymphocytes that make antibodies to help fight infection    .
- T - cell lymphocytes that help B - lymphocytes make the antibodies that help fight infection    .
- Natural killer cells that attack cancer cells and viruses    .
In mycosis fungoides , T - cell lymphocytes become cancerous and affect the skin    .
In the Szary syndrome , cancerous T - cell lymphocytes affect the skin and are in the blood    .
Mycosis fungoides and the Szary syndrome are types of cutaneous T - cell lymphoma    .
Mycosis fungoides and the Szary syndrome are the two most common types of cutaneous T - cell lymphoma ( a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma )    .
For information about other types of skin cancer or non-Hodgkin lymphoma , see the following PDQ summaries : - Adult Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Treatment - Skin Cancer Treatment - Melanoma Treatment - Kaposi Sarcoma Treatment
In the Szary syndrome , cancerous T - cells are found in the blood    .
Also , skin all over the body is reddened , itchy , peeling , and painful    .
There may also be patches , plaques , or tumors on the skin    .
It is not known if the Szary syndrome is an advanced form of mycosis fungoides or a separate disease    .
What are the symptoms of Mycosis Fungoides and the Szary Syndrome ?
A sign of mycosis fungoides is a red rash on the skin    .
Mycosis fungoides may go through the following phases : - Premycotic phase : A scaly , red rash in areas of the body that usually are not exposed to the sun    .
This rash does not cause symptoms and may last for months or years    .
It is hard to diagnose the rash as mycosis fungoides during this phase    .
- Patch phase :
Thin , reddened , eczema - like rash    .
- Plaque phase : Small raised bumps ( papules ) or hardened lesions on the skin , which may be reddened    .
- Tumor phase : Tumors form on the skin    .
These tumors may develop ulcers and the skin may get infected    .
Check with your doctor if you have any of these signs    .
How to diagnose Mycosis Fungoides and the Szary Syndrome ?
Tests that examine the skin and blood are used to detect ( find ) and diagnose mycosis fungoides and the Szary syndrome    .
The following tests and procedures may be used : - Physical exam and history :
An exam of the body to check general signs of health , including checking for signs of disease , such as lumps , the number and type of skin lesions , or anything else that seems unusual    .
Pictures of the skin and a history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken    .
- Complete blood count with differential :
A procedure in which a sample of blood is drawn and checked for the following : - The number of red blood cells and platelets    .
- Peripheral blood smear :
A procedure in which a sample of blood is viewed under a microscope to count different circulating blood cells ( red blood cells , white blood cells , platelets , etc   .    ) and see whether the cells look normal    .
- Skin biopsy :
The removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope to check for signs of cancer    .
The doctor may remove a growth from the skin , which will be examined by a pathologist    .
More than one skin biopsy may be needed to diagnose mycosis fungoides    .
- Immunophenotyping :
A process used to identify cells , based on the types of antigens or markers on the surface of the cell    .
This process may include special staining of the blood cells    .
It is used to diagnose specific types of leukemia and lymphoma by comparing the cancer cells to normal cells of the immune system    .
- T - cell receptor ( TCR ) gene rearrangement test :
A laboratory test in which cells in a sample of tissue are checked to see if there is a certain change in the genes    .
This gene change can lead to too many of one kind of T - cells ( white blood cells that fight infection ) to be made    .
- Flow cytometry :
A laboratory test that measures the number of cells in a sample of blood , the percentage of live cells in a sample , and certain characteristics of cells , such as size , shape , and the presence of tumor markers on the cell surface    .
The cells are stained with a light - sensitive dye , placed in a fluid , and passed in a stream before a laser or other type of light    .
The measurements are based on how the light - sensitive dye reacts to the light    .
What is the outlook for Mycosis Fungoides and the Szary Syndrome ?
Certain factors affect prognosis ( chance of recovery ) and treatment options    .
The prognosis ( chance of recovery ) and treatment options depend on the following : - The stage of the cancer    .    - The type of lesion ( patches , plaques , or tumors )    .
Mycosis fungoides and the Szary syndrome are hard to cure    .
Treatment is usually palliative , to relieve symptoms and improve the quality of life    .
Patients with early stage disease may live many years    .
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Mycosis Fungoides and the Szary Syndrome ?
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
For some patients , taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice    .
Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process    .

What are the stages of Mycosis Fungoides and the Szary Syndrome ?
Key Points
- After mycosis fungoides and the Szary syndrome have been diagnosed , tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread from the skin to other parts of the body    .
- There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body    .
- Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body    .
- The following stages are used for mycosis fungoides and the Szary syndrome : - Stage I Mycosis Fungoides - Stage II Mycosis Fungoides - Stage III Mycosis Fungoides - Stage IV Mycosis Fungoides - Stage IV Szary Syndrome
After mycosis fungoides and the Szary syndrome have been diagnosed , tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread from the skin to other parts of the body    .
The process used to find out if cancer has spread from the skin to other parts of the body is called staging    .
The information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease    .
It is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment    .
The following procedures may be used in the staging process : - Chest x-ray :
An x-ray of the organs and bones inside the chest    .
An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film , making a picture of areas inside the body    .
- CT scan ( CAT scan ) : A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body , such as the lymph nodes , chest , abdomen , and pelvis , taken from different angles    .
The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine    .
A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly    .
This procedure is also called computed tomography , computerized tomography , or computerized axial tomography    .
- PET scan ( positron emission tomography scan ) : A procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body    .
A small amount of radioactive glucose ( sugar ) is injected into a vein    .
The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body    .
Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do    .
- Lymph node biopsy :
The removal of all or part of a lymph node    .
A pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells    .
- Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy :
The removal of bone marrow and a small piece of bone by inserting a hollow needle into the hipbone or breastbone    .
A pathologist views the bone marrow and bone under a microscope to look for signs of cancer    .
There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body    .
Cancer can spread through tissue , the lymph system , and the blood : - Tissue    .
The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas    .
- Lymph system    .
The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system    .
The cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body    .
- Blood    .
The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood    .
The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body    .
Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body    .
When cancer spreads to another part of the body , it is called metastasis    .
Cancer cells break away from where they began ( the primary tumor ) and travel through the lymph system or blood    .
- Lymph system    .
The cancer gets into the lymph system , travels through the lymph vessels , and forms a tumor ( metastatic tumor ) in another part of the body    .
- Blood    .
The cancer gets into the blood , travels through the blood vessels , and forms a tumor ( metastatic tumor ) in another part of the body    .
The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor    .
For example , if mycosis fungoides spreads to the liver , the cancer cells in the liver are actually mycosis fungoides cells    .
The disease is metastatic mycosis fungoides , not liver cancer    .
The following stages are used for mycosis fungoides and the Szary syndrome :
Stage I Mycosis Fungoides Stage I is divided into stage IA and stage IB as follows : - Stage IA : Less than 10 % of the skin surface is covered with patches , papules , and / or plaques    .
- Stage IB : Ten percent or more of the skin surface is covered with patches , papules , and / or plaques    .
There may be abnormal lymphocytes in the blood but they are not cancerous    .
Stage II Mycosis Fungoides Stage II is divided into stage IIA and stage IIB as follows : - Stage IIA : Any amount of the skin surface is covered with patches , papules , and / or plaques    .
Lymph nodes are enlarged but cancer has not spread to them    .
- Stage IIB : One or more tumors that are 1 centimeter or larger are found on the skin    .
Lymph nodes may be enlarged but cancer has not spread to them    .
There may be abnormal lymphocytes in the blood but they are not cancerous    .
Stage III Mycosis Fungoides
In stage III , nearly all of the skin is reddened and may have patches , papules , plaques , or tumors    .
Lymph nodes may be enlarged but cancer has not spread to them    .
There may be abnormal lymphocytes in the blood but they are not cancerous    .
Stage IV Mycosis Fungoides Stage IV is divided into stage IVA and stage IVB as follows : - Stage IVA : Most of the skin is reddened and any amount of the skin surface is covered with patches , papules , plaques , or tumors , and either : - cancer has spread to lymph nodes and there may be cancerous lymphocytes in the blood ; or - there are cancerous lymphocytes in the blood and lymph nodes may be enlarged , but cancer has not spread to them    .
- Stage IVB : Most of the skin is reddened and any amount of the skin surface is covered with patches , papules , plaques , or tumors    .
Cancer has spread to other organs in the body    .
Lymph nodes may be enlarged and cancer may have spread to them    .
There may be cancerous lymphocytes in the blood    .
Stage IV Szary Syndrome
In stage IV : - Most of the skin is reddened and covered with patches , papules , plaques , or tumors ; and - There is a high level of cancerous lymphocytes in the blood ; and - Lymph nodes may be enlarged and cancer may have spread to them    .
What are the treatments for Mycosis Fungoides and the Szary Syndrome ?
Key Points
- There are different types of treatment for patients with mycosis fungoides and the Szary syndrome cancer    .
- Six types of standard treatment are used : - Photodynamic therapy - Radiation therapy - Chemotherapy - Other drug therapy - Biologic therapy - Targeted therapy - New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials    .
- High - dose chemotherapy and radiation therapy with stem cell transplant - Treatment for mycosis fungoides and the Szary syndrome may cause side effects    .
- Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
- Patients can enter clinical trials before , during , or after starting their cancer treatment    .
- Follow - up tests may be needed    .
There are different types of treatment for patients with mycosis fungoides and the Szary syndrome cancer    .
Different types of treatment are available for patients with mycosis fungoides and the Szary syndrome    .
Some treatments are standard ( the currently used treatment ) , and some are being tested in clinical trials    .
A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer    .
When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment , the new treatment may become the standard treatment    .
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment    .
Six types of standard treatment are used :
Photodynamic therapy Photodynamic therapy is a cancer treatment that uses a drug and a certain type of laser light to kill cancer cells    .
A drug that is not active until it is exposed to light is injected into a vein    .
The drug collects more in cancer cells than in normal cells    .
For skin cancer , laser light is shined onto the skin and the drug becomes active and kills the cancer cells    .
Photodynamic therapy causes little damage to healthy tissue    .
Patients undergoing photodynamic therapy will need to limit the amount of time spent in sunlight    .
In one type of photodynamic therapy , called psoralen and ultraviolet A ( PUVA ) therapy , the patient receives a drug called psoralen and then ultraviolet radiation is directed to the skin    .
In another type of photodynamic therapy , called extracorporeal photochemotherapy , the patient is given drugs and then some blood cells are taken from the body , put under a special ultraviolet A light , and put back into the body    .
Radiation therapy Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high - energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing    .
There are two types of radiation therapy : - External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer    .
- Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles , seeds , wires , or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer    .
The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated    .
External radiation therapy is used to treat mycosis fungoides and the Szary syndrome , and may also be used as palliative therapy to relieve symptoms and improve quality of life    .
Sometimes , total skin electron beam ( TSEB ) radiation therapy is used to treat mycosis fungoides and the Szary syndrome    .
This is a type of external radiation treatment in which a radiation therapy machine aims electrons ( tiny , invisible particles ) at the skin covering the whole body    .
Ultraviolet B ( UVB ) radiation therapy uses a special lamp or laser that directs UVB radiation at the skin    .
Chemotherapy Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells , either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing    .
When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle , the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body ( systemic chemotherapy )    .
When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid , an organ , or a body cavity such as the abdomen , the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas ( regional chemotherapy )    .
Sometimes the chemotherapy is topical ( put on the skin in a cream , lotion , or ointment )    .
The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated    .
See Drugs Approved for Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma for more information    .
( Mycosis fungoides and the Szary syndrome are types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma    .    )
Other drug therapy Topical corticosteroids are used to relieve red , swollen , and inflamed skin    .
They are a type of steroid    .
Topical corticosteroids may be in a cream , lotion , or ointment    .
Retinoids , such as bexarotene , are drugs related to vitamin A that can slow the growth of certain types of cancer cells    .
The retinoids may be taken by mouth or put on the skin    .
See Drugs Approved for Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma for more information    .
( Mycosis fungoides and the Szary syndrome are types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma    .    )
Biologic therapy Biologic therapy is a treatment that uses the patient 's immune system to fight cancer    .
Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost , direct , or restore the body 's natural defenses against cancer    .
This type of cancer treatment is also called biotherapy or immunotherapy    .
Interferon is a type of biologic therapy used to treat mycosis fungoides and the Szary syndrome    .
It interferes with the division of cancer cells and can slow tumor growth    .
See Drugs Approved for Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma for more information    .

Targeted therapy Targeted therapy is a treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells    .
Monoclonal antibody therapy and other types of targeted therapies are used to treat mycosis fungoides and the Szary syndrome    .
Alemtuzumab is a monoclonal antibody used to treat mycosis fungoides and the Szary syndrome    .
Monoclonal antibody therapy uses antibodies made in the laboratory , from a single type of immune system cell    .
These antibodies can identify substances on cancer cells or normal substances that may help cancer cells grow    .
The antibodies attach to the substances and kill the cancer cells , block their growth , or keep them from spreading    .
Monoclonal antibodies are given by infusion    .
They may be used alone or to carry drugs , toxins , or radioactive material directly to cancer cells    .
Other types of monoclonal antibody therapy are being studied in clinical trials to treat mycosis fungoides and the Szary syndrome    .
Vorinostat and romidepsin are two of the histone deacetylase ( HDAC ) inhibitors used to treat mycosis fungoides and the Szary syndrome    .
HDAC inhibitors cause a chemical change that stops tumor cells from dividing    .
Pralatrexate is a dihydrofolate reductase ( DHFR ) inhibitor used to treat mycosis fungoides and the Szary syndrome    .
It builds up in cancer cells and stops them from using folate , a nutrient needed for cells to divide    .
Pralatrexate may slow the growth of tumors and kill cancer cells    .
See Drugs Approved for Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma for more information    .
( Mycosis fungoides and the Szary syndrome are types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma    .    )

High - dose chemotherapy and radiation therapy with stem cell transplant
This treatment is a method of giving high doses of chemotherapy and radiation therapy and replacing blood - forming cells destroyed by the cancer treatment    .
Stem cells ( immature blood cells ) are removed from the bone marrow or blood of the patient or a donor and are frozen and stored    .
After therapy is completed , the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion    .
These reinfused stem cells grow into ( and restore ) the body 's blood cells    .

What is (are) Primary CNS Lymphoma ?
Key Points
- Primary central nervous system ( CNS ) lymphoma is a disease in which malignant ( cancer ) cells form in the lymph tissue of the brain and / or spinal cord    .
- Having a weakened immune system may increase the risk of developing primary CNS lymphoma    .
- Tests that examine the eyes , brain , and spinal cord are used to detect ( find ) and diagnose primary CNS lymphoma    .
- Certain factors affect prognosis ( chance of recovery ) and treatment options    .
Primary central nervous system ( CNS ) lymphoma is a disease in which malignant ( cancer ) cells form in the lymph tissue of the brain and / or spinal cord    .
Lymphoma is a disease in which malignant ( cancer ) cells form in the lymph system    .
The lymph system is part of the immune system and is made up of the lymph , lymph vessels , lymph nodes , spleen , thymus , tonsils , and bone marrow    .
Lymphocytes ( carried in the lymph ) travel in and out of the central nervous system ( CNS )    .
It is thought that some of these lymphocytes become malignant and cause lymphoma to form in the CNS    .
Primary CNS lymphoma can start in the brain , spinal cord , or meninges ( the layers that form the outer covering of the brain )    .
Because the eye is so close to the brain , primary CNS lymphoma can also start in the eye ( called ocular lymphoma )    .
Who is at risk for Primary CNS Lymphoma? ?
Having a weakened immune system may increase the risk of developing primary CNS lymphoma    .
Anything that increases your chance of getting a disease is called a risk factor    .
Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer ; not having risk factors doesnt mean that you will not get cancer    .
Talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk    .
Primary CNS lymphoma may occur in patients who have acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) or other disorders of the immune system or who have had a kidney transplant    .
For more information about lymphoma in patients with AIDS , see the PDQ summary on AIDS - Related Lymphoma Treatment    .
How to diagnose Primary CNS Lymphoma ?
Tests that examine the eyes , brain , and spinal cord are used to detect ( find ) and diagnose primary CNS lymphoma    .
An exam of the body to check general signs of health , including checking for signs of disease , such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual    .
A history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken    .
- Neurological exam :
A series of questions and tests to check the brain , spinal cord , and nerve function    .
The exam checks a persons mental status , coordination , ability to walk normally , and how well the muscles , senses , and reflexes work    .
This may also be called a neuro exam or a neurologic exam    .
- Slit - lamp eye exam :
An exam that uses a special microscope with a bright , narrow slit of light to check the outside and inside of the eye    .
- MRI ( magnetic resonance imaging ) : A procedure that uses a magnet , radio waves , and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the brain and spinal cord    .
A substance called gadolinium is injected into the patient through a vein    .
The gadolinium collects around the cancer cells so they show up brighter in the picture    .
This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging ( NMRI )    .
- PET scan ( positron emission tomography scan ) : A procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body    .
A small amount of radioactive glucose ( sugar ) is injected into a vein    .
The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body    .
Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do    .
- Lumbar puncture : A procedure used to collect cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) from the spinal column    .
This is done by placing a needle between two bones in the spine and into the CSF around the spinal cord and removing a sample of the fluid    .
The sample of CSF is checked under a microscope for signs of tumor cells    .
The sample may also be checked for the amounts of protein and glucose    .
A higher than normal amount of protein or lower than normal amount of glucose may be a sign of a tumor    .
This procedure is also called an LP or spinal tap    .
- Stereotactic biopsy : A biopsy procedure that uses a computer and a 3 - dimensional ( 3 - D ) scanning device to find a tumor site and guide the removal of tissue so it can be viewed under a microscope to check for signs of cancer    .
The following tests may be done on the samples of tissue that are removed : - Flow cytometry :
A laboratory test that measures the number of cells in a sample , the percentage of live cells in a sample , and certain characteristics of cells , such as size , shape , and the presence of tumor markers on the cell surface    .
The cells are stained with a light - sensitive dye , placed in a fluid , and passed in a stream before a laser or other type of light    .
The measurements are based on how the light - sensitive dye reacts to the light    .
- Immunohistochemistry :
A test that uses antibodies to check for certain antigens in a sample of tissue    .
The antibody is usually linked to a radioactive substance or a dye that causes the tissue to light up under a microscope    .
This type of test may be used to tell the difference between different types of cancer    .
- Cytogenetic analysis : A laboratory test in which cells in a sample of tissue are viewed under a microscope to look for certain changes in the chromosomes    .
Other tests , such as fluorescence in situ hybridization ( FISH ) , may also be done to look for certain changes in the chromosomes    .
- Complete blood count ( CBC ) with differential :
A procedure in which a sample of blood is drawn and checked for the following : - The number of red blood cells and platelets    .
- The number and type of white blood cells    .
- The amount of hemoglobin ( the protein that carries oxygen ) in the red blood cells    .
- The portion of the blood sample made up of red blood cells    .
- Blood chemistry studies :
A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body    .
An unusual ( higher or lower than normal ) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease    .
What is the outlook for Primary CNS Lymphoma ?
Certain factors affect prognosis ( chance of recovery ) and treatment options    .
The prognosis ( chance of recovery ) depends on the following : - The patient 's age and general health    .
- The level of certain substances in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF )    .    - Where the tumor is in the central nervous system , eye , or both    .
- Whether the patient has AIDS    .
Treatment options depend on the following : - The stage of the cancer    .    - Where the tumor is in the central nervous system    .
- The patient 's age and general health    .
- Whether the cancer has just been diagnosed or has recurred ( come back )    .
Treatment of primary CNS lymphoma works best when the tumor has not spread outside the cerebrum ( the largest part of the brain ) and the patient is younger than 60 years , able to carry out most daily activities , and does not have AIDS or other diseases that weaken the immune system    .
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Primary CNS Lymphoma ?
New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials    .
This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials    .
It may not mention every new treatment being studied    .
Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website    .
High - dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant High - dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant is a method of giving high doses of chemotherapy and replacing blood - forming cells destroyed by the cancer treatment    .
Stem cells ( immature blood cells ) are removed from the blood or bone marrow of the patient or a donor and are frozen and stored    .
After the chemotherapy is completed , the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion    .
These reinfused stem cells grow into ( and restore ) the body 's blood cells    .
Targeted therapy Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to attack cancer cells    .
Targeted therapies usually cause less harm to normal cells than chemotherapy or radiation therapy do    .
Monoclonal antibody therapy is one type of targeted therapy being studied in the treatment of primary CNS lymphoma    .
Monoclonal antibody therapy is a cancer treatment that uses antibodies made in the laboratory from a single type of immune system cell    .
These antibodies can identify substances on cancer cells or normal substances that may help cancer cells grow    .
The antibodies attach to the substances and kill the cancer cells , block their growth , or keep them from spreading    .
Monoclonal antibodies are given by infusion    .
They may be used alone or to carry drugs , toxins , or radioactive material directly to cancer cells    .
Rituximab is a type of monoclonal antibody used to treat newly diagnosed primary CNS lymphoma in patients who do not have AIDS    .
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
For some patients , taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice    .
Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process    .
Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment    .
Many of today 's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials    .
Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment    .
Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future    .
Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments , they often answer important questions and help move research forward    .
Patients can enter clinical trials before , during , or after starting their cancer treatment    .
Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment    .
Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better    .
There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring ( coming back ) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment    .
Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country    .
See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials    .
These have been retrieved from NCI 's listing of clinical trials    .
What are the treatments for Primary CNS Lymphoma ?
Key Points
- There are different types of treatment for patients with primary CNS lymphoma    .
- Three standard treatments are used : - Radiation therapy - Chemotherapy - Steroid therapy - New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials    .
- High - dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant - Targeted therapy - Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
- Patients can enter clinical trials before , during , or after starting their cancer treatment    .
- Follow - up tests may be needed    .
There are different types of treatment for patients with primary CNS lymphoma    .
Different types of treatment are available for patients with primary central nervous system ( CNS ) lymphoma    .
Some treatments are standard ( the currently used treatment ) , and some are being tested in clinical trials    .
A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer    .
When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment , the new treatment may become the standard treatment    .
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment    .
Surgery is not used to treat primary CNS lymphoma    .
Three standard treatments are used :
Radiation therapy Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high - energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing    .
There are two types of radiation therapy : - External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer    .
Because primary CNS lymphoma spreads throughout the brain , external radiation therapy is given to the whole brain    .
This is called whole brain radiation therapy    .
- Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles , seeds , wires , or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer    .
The way the radiation therapy is given depends on whether the patient has primary CNS lymphoma and AIDS    .
External radiation therapy is used to treat primary CNS lymphoma    .
High - dose radiation therapy to the brain can damage healthy tissue and cause disorders that can affect thinking , learning , problem solving , speech , reading , writing , and memory    .
Clinical trials have tested the use of chemotherapy alone or before radiation therapy to reduce the damage to healthy brain tissue that occurs with the use of radiation therapy    .
Chemotherapy Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells , either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing    .
When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle , the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body ( systemic chemotherapy )    .
When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid ( intrathecal chemotherapy ) , an organ , or a body cavity such as the abdomen , the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas ( regional chemotherapy )    .
The way the chemotherapy is given depends on where the tumor is in the CNS or eye    .
Primary CNS lymphoma may be treated with systemic chemotherapy , intrathecal chemotherapy and / or intraventricular chemotherapy , in which anticancer drugs are placed into the ventricles ( fluid - filled cavities ) of the brain    .
If primary CNS lymphoma is found in the eye , anticancer drugs are injected directly into the vitreous humor ( jelly - like substance ) inside the eye    .
A network of blood vessels and tissue , called the blood - brain barrier , protects the brain from harmful substances    .
This barrier can also keep anticancer drugs from reaching the brain    .
In order to treat CNS lymphoma , certain drugs may be used to make openings between cells in the blood - brain barrier    .
This is called blood - brain barrier disruption    .
Anticancer drugs infused into the bloodstream may then reach the brain    .
Steroid therapy Steroids are hormones made naturally in the body    .
They can also be made in a laboratory and used as drugs    .
Glucocorticoids are steroid drugs that have an anticancer effect in lymphomas    .
New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials    .

These have been retrieved from NCI 's listing of clinical trials    .
Follow - up tests may be needed    .
Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated    .
Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working    .
Decisions about whether to continue , change , or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests    .
Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended    .
The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred ( come back )    .
These tests are sometimes called follow - up tests or check - ups    .

What is (are) Childhood Hodgkin Lymphoma ?
Key Points
- Childhood Hodgkin lymphoma is a disease in which malignant ( cancer ) cells form in the lymph system    .
- There are two types of childhood Hodgkin lymphoma    .
- Epstein - Barr virus infection increases the risk of childhood Hodgkin lymphoma    .
- Signs of childhood Hodgkin lymphoma include swollen lymph nodes , fever , night sweats , and weight loss    .
- Tests that examine the lymph system are used to detect ( find ) and diagnose childhood Hodgkin lymphoma    .
- Certain factors affect prognosis ( chance of recovery ) and treatment options    .
Childhood Hodgkin lymphoma is a disease in which malignant ( cancer ) cells form in the lymph system    .
Childhood Hodgkin lymphoma is a type of cancer that develops in the lymph system , which is part of the body 's immune system    .
The immune system protects the body from foreign substances , infection , and diseases    .
The lymph system is made up of the following : - Lymph : Colorless , watery fluid that carries white blood cells called lymphocytes through the lymph system    .
Lymphocytes protect the body against infections and the growth of tumors    .
- Lymph vessels : A network of thin tubes that collect lymph from different parts of the body and return it to the bloodstream    .
- Lymph nodes : Small , bean - shaped structures that filter lymph and store white blood cells that help fight infection and disease    .
Lymph nodes are located along the network of lymph vessels found throughout the body    .
Clusters of lymph nodes are found in the neck , underarm , abdomen , pelvis , and groin    .
- Spleen :
An organ that makes lymphocytes , filters the blood , stores blood cells , and destroys old blood cells    .
The spleen is on the left side of the abdomen near the stomach    .
- Thymus :
An organ in which lymphocytes grow and multiply    .
The thymus is in the chest behind the breastbone    .
- Tonsils :
Two small masses of lymph tissue at the back of the throat    .
The tonsils make lymphocytes    .
- Bone marrow :
The soft , spongy tissue in the center of large bones    .
Bone marrow makes white blood cells , red blood cells , and platelets    .
Lymph tissue is also found in other parts of the body such as the stomach , thyroid gland , brain , and skin    .
There are two general types of lymphoma : Hodgkin lymphoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma    .
( See the PDQ summary on Childhood Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Treatment for more information    .    )
Hodgkin lymphoma often occurs in adolescents 15 to 19 years of age    .
The treatment for children and adolescents is different than treatment for adults    .
( See the PDQ summary on Adult Hodgkin Lymphoma Treatment for more information    .    )
There are two types of childhood Hodgkin lymphoma    .
The two types of childhood Hodgkin lymphoma are : - Classical Hodgkin lymphoma    .    - Nodular lymphocyte - predominant Hodgkin lymphoma    .
Classical Hodgkin lymphoma is divided into four subtypes , based on how the cancer cells look under a microscope : - Lymphocyte - rich classical Hodgkin lymphoma    .
- Nodular sclerosis Hodgkin lymphoma    .    - Mixed cellularity Hodgkin lymphoma    .
- Lymphocyte - depleted Hodgkin lymphoma    .
Who is at risk for Childhood Hodgkin Lymphoma? ?
Epstein - Barr virus infection increases the risk of childhood Hodgkin lymphoma    .
Anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor    .
Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer ; not having risk factors doesnt mean that you will not get cancer    .
Talk with your childs doctor if you think your child may be at risk    .
Risk factors for childhood Hodgkin lymphoma include the following : - Being infected with the Epstein - Barr virus    .
- Being infected with the human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV )    .
- Having certain diseases of the immune system    .
- Having a personal history of mononucleosis ( &quot; mono&quot ; )    .
- Having a parent or sibling with a personal history of Hodgkin lymphoma    .
Being exposed to common infections in early childhood may decrease the risk of Hodgkin lymphoma in children because of the effect it has on the immune system    .
What are the symptoms of Childhood Hodgkin Lymphoma ?
Signs of childhood Hodgkin lymphoma include swollen lymph nodes , fever , night sweats , and weight loss    .
These and other signs and symptoms may be caused by childhood Hodgkin lymphoma or by other conditions    .
Check with your child 's doctor if your child has any of the following : - Painless , swollen lymph nodes near the collarbone or in the neck , chest , underarm , or groin    .
- Fever for no known reason    .
- Weight loss for no known reason    .
- Night sweats    .
- Fatigue    .    - Anorexia    .    - Itchy skin    .
- Pain in the lymph nodes after drinking alcohol    .
Fever , weight loss , and night sweats are called B symptoms    .
How to diagnose Childhood Hodgkin Lymphoma ?
Tests that examine the lymph system are used to detect ( find ) and diagnose childhood Hodgkin lymphoma    .
The following tests and procedures may be used : - Physical exam and history :
An exam of the body to check general signs of health , including checking for signs of disease , such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual    .
A history of the patient 's health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken    .
- CT scan ( CAT scan ) : A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body , such as the neck , chest , abdomen , or pelvis , taken from different angles    .
The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine    .
A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly    .
This procedure is also called computed tomography , computerized tomography , or computerized axial tomography    .
- PET scan ( positron emission tomography scan ) : A procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body    .
A small amount of radioactive glucose ( sugar ) is injected into a vein    .
The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body    .
Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do    .
Sometimes a PET scan and a CT scan are done at the same time    .
If there is any cancer , this increases the chance that it will be found    .
- Chest x-ray :
An x-ray of the organs and bones inside the chest    .
An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film , making a picture of areas inside the body    .
- Complete blood count ( CBC ) : A procedure in which a sample of blood is drawn and checked for the following : - The number of red blood cells , white blood cells , and platelets    .
- The amount of hemoglobin ( the protein that carries oxygen ) in the red blood cells    .
- The portion of the blood sample made up of red blood cells    .
- Blood chemistry studies :
A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body    .
An unusual ( higher or lower than normal ) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease    .
- Sedimentation rate : A procedure in which a sample of blood is drawn and checked for the rate at which the red blood cells settle to the bottom of the test tube    .
The sedimentation rate is a measure of how much inflammation is in the body    .
A higher than normal sedimentation rate may be a sign of lymphoma    .
Also called erythrocyte sedimentation rate , sed rate , or ESR    .
- Lymph node biopsy :
The removal of all or part of a lymph node    .
The lymph node may be removed during an image - guided CT scan or a thoracoscopy , mediastinoscopy , or laparoscopy    .
One of the following types of biopsies may be done : - Excisional biopsy :
The removal of an entire lymph node    .
- Incisional biopsy :
The removal of part of a lymph node    .
- Core biopsy :
The removal of tissue from a lymph node using a wide needle    .
- Fine - needle aspiration ( FNA ) biopsy :
The removal of tissue from a lymph node using a thin needle    .
A pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells , especially Reed - Sternberg cells    .
Reed - Sternberg cells are common in classical Hodgkin lymphoma    .
The following test may be done on tissue that was removed : - Immunophenotyping :
A laboratory test used to identify cells , based on the types of antigens or markers on the surface of the cell    .
This test is used to diagnose the specific type of lymphoma by comparing the cancer cells to normal cells of the immune system    .
What is the outlook for Childhood Hodgkin Lymphoma ?
Certain factors affect prognosis ( chance of recovery ) and treatment options    .
The prognosis ( chance of recovery ) and treatment options depend on the following : - The stage of the cancer    .    - The size of the tumor    .
- Whether there are B symptoms at diagnosis    .
- The type of Hodgkin lymphoma    .
- Certain features of the cancer cells    .
- Whether there are too many white blood cells or too few red blood cells at the time of diagnosis    .
- How well the tumor responds to initial treatment with chemotherapy    .
- Whether the cancer is newly diagnosed or has recurred ( come back )    .
The treatment options also depend on : - The child 's age and gender    .
- The risk of long - term side effects    .
Most children and adolescents with newly diagnosed Hodgkin lymphoma can be cured    .
What are the stages of Childhood Hodgkin Lymphoma ?
Key Points
- After childhood Hodgkin lymphoma has been diagnosed , tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the lymph system or to other parts of the body    .
- There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body    .
- Stages of childhood Hodgkin lymphoma may include A , B , E , and S   .    - The following stages are used for childhood Hodgkin lymphoma : - Stage I - Stage II - Stage III - Stage IV - Untreated Hodgkin lymphoma is divided into risk groups    .
After childhood Hodgkin lymphoma has been diagnosed , tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the lymph system or to other parts of the body    .
The process used to find out if cancer has spread within the lymph system or to other parts of the body is called staging    .
The information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease    .
Treatment is based on the stage and other factors that affect prognosis    .
The following tests and procedures may be used in the staging process : - CT scan ( CAT scan ) :
A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body , such as the neck , chest , abdomen , or pelvis , taken from different angles    .
The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine    .
A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly    .
This procedure is also called computed tomography , computerized tomography , or computerized axial tomography    .
- PET scan ( positron emission tomography scan ) : A procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body    .

Sometimes a PET scan and a CT scan are done at the same time    .
If there is any cancer , this increases the chance that it will be found    .
- MRI ( magnetic resonance imaging ) : A procedure that uses a magnet , radio waves , and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body    .
This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging ( NMRI )    .
An MRI of the abdomen and pelvis may be done    .
- Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy :
The removal of bone marrow and a small piece of bone by inserting a hollow needle into the hipbone or breastbone    .
A pathologist views the bone marrow and bone under a microscope to look for abnormal cells    .
There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body    .
Cancer can spread through tissue , the lymph system , and the blood : - Tissue    .
The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas    .
- Lymph system    .
The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system    .
The cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body    .
- Blood    .
The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood    .
The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body    .
Stages of childhood Hodgkin lymphoma may include A , B , E , and S    .
Childhood Hodgkin lymphoma may be described as follows : - A : The patient does not have B symptoms ( fever , weight loss , or night sweats )    .
- B : The patient has B symptoms    .
- E : Cancer is found in an organ or tissue that is not part of the lymph system but which may be next to an area of the lymph system affected by the cancer    .
- S : Cancer is found in the spleen    .
The following stages are used for childhood Hodgkin lymphoma :
Stage I Stage I is divided into stage I and stage IE    .
- Stage I : Cancer is found in one of the following places in the lymph system : - One or more lymph nodes in one lymph node group    .
- Waldeyer 's ring    .
- Thymus    .    - Spleen    .    - Stage IE : Cancer is found outside the lymph system in one organ or area    .
Stage II Stage II is divided into stage II and stage IIE    .
- Stage II : Cancer is found in two or more lymph node groups either above or below the diaphragm ( the thin muscle below the lungs that helps breathing and separates the chest from the abdomen )    .
- Stage IIE : Cancer is found in one or more lymph node groups either above or below the diaphragm and outside the lymph nodes in a nearby organ or area    .
Stage III Stage III is divided into stage III , stage IIIE , stage IIIS , and stage IIIE , S   .    - Stage III : Cancer is found in lymph node groups above and below the diaphragm ( the thin muscle below the lungs that helps breathing and separates the chest from the abdomen )    .
- Stage IIIE : Cancer is found in lymph node groups above and below the diaphragm and outside the lymph nodes in a nearby organ or area    .
- Stage IIIS : Cancer is found in lymph node groups above and below the diaphragm , and in the spleen    .
- Stage IIIE,S : Cancer is found in lymph node groups above and below the diaphragm , outside the lymph nodes in a nearby organ or area , and in the spleen    .
Stage IV
In stage IV , the cancer : - is found outside the lymph nodes throughout one or more organs , and may be in lymph nodes near those organs ; or - is found outside the lymph nodes in one organ and has spread to areas far away from that organ ; or - is found in the lung , liver , bone marrow , or cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF )    .
The cancer has not spread to the lung , liver , bone marrow , or CSF from nearby areas    .
Untreated Hodgkin lymphoma is divided into risk groups    .
Untreated childhood Hodgkin lymphoma is divided into risk groups based on the stage , size of the tumor , and whether the patient has B symptoms ( fever , weight loss , or night sweats )    .
The risk group is used to plan treatment    .
- Low - risk childhood Hodgkin lymphoma    .
- Intermediate - risk childhood Hodgkin lymphoma    .
- High - risk childhood Hodgkin lymphoma    .
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Childhood Hodgkin Lymphoma ?
New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials    .
This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials    .
It may not mention every new treatment being studied    .
Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website    .
Proton beam radiation therapy Proton - beam therapy is a type of high - energy , external radiation therapy that uses streams of protons ( small , positively - charged particles of matter ) to make radiation    .
This type of radiation therapy may help lessen the damage to healthy tissue near the tumor    .
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
For some patients , taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice    .
Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process    .
Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment    .
Many of today 's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials    .
Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment    .
Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future    .
Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments , they often answer important questions and help move research forward    .
Patients can enter clinical trials before , during , or after starting their cancer treatment    .
Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment    .
Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better    .
There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring ( coming back ) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment    .
Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country    .
See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials    .
These have been retrieved from NCI 's listing of clinical trials    .
What are the treatments for Childhood Hodgkin Lymphoma ?
Key Points
- There are different types of treatment for children with Hodgkin lymphoma    .
- Children with Hodgkin lymphoma should have their treatment planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating childhood cancer    .
- Children and adolescents may have treatment - related side effects that appear months or years after treatment for Hodgkin lymphoma    .
- Five types of standard treatment are used : - Chemotherapy - Radiation therapy - Targeted therapy - Surgery - High - dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant - New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials    .
- Proton beam radiation therapy - Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
- Patients can enter clinical trials before , during , or after starting their cancer treatment    .
- Follow - up tests may be needed    .
There are different types of treatment for children with Hodgkin lymphoma    .
Different types of treatment are available for children with Hodgkin lymphoma    .
Some treatments are standard and some are being tested in clinical trials    .
A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer    .
When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment , the new treatment may become the standard treatment    .
Because cancer in children is rare , taking part in a clinical trial should be considered    .
Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment    .
Children with Hodgkin lymphoma should have their treatment planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating childhood cancer    .
Treatment will be overseen by a pediatric oncologist , a doctor who specializes in treating children with cancer    .
The pediatric oncologist works with other pediatric health care providers who are experts in treating children with Hodgkin lymphoma and who specialize in certain areas of medicine    .
These may include the following specialists : - Pediatrician    .    - Medical oncologist / hematologist    .
- Pediatric surgeon    .
- Radiation oncologist    .
- Endocrinologist    .
- Pediatric nurse specialist    .
- Rehabilitation specialist    .
- Psychologist    .
- Social worker    .
- Child - life specialist    .
The treatment of Hodgkin lymphoma in adolescents and young adults may be different than the treatment for children    .
Some adolescents and young adults are treated with an adult treatment regimen    .
Children and adolescents may have treatment - related side effects that appear months or years after treatment for Hodgkin lymphoma    .
Some cancer treatments cause side effects that continue or appear months or years after cancer treatment has ended    .
These are called late effects    .
Because late effects affect health and development , regular follow - up exams are important    .
Late effects of cancer treatment may include : - Physical problems that affect the following : - Development of sex and reproductive organs    .
- Fertility ( ability to have children )    .
- Bone and muscle growth and development    .
- Thyroid , heart , or lung function    .
- Teeth , gums , and salivary gland function    .
- Spleen function ( increased risk of infection )    .
- Changes in mood , feelings , thinking , learning , or memory    .
- Second cancers ( new types of cancer )    .
For female survivors of Hodgkin lymphoma , there is an increased risk of breast cancer    .
This risk depends on the amount of radiation therapy they received to the breast during treatment and the chemotherapy regimen used    .
The risk of breast cancer is decreased if these female survivors also received radiation therapy to the ovaries    .
It is suggested that female survivors who received radiation therapy to the breast have a mammogram once a year starting 8 years after treatment or at age 25 years , whichever is later    .
Female survivors of childhood Hodgkin lymphoma who have breast cancer have an increased risk of dying from the disease compared to patients with no history of Hodgkin lymphoma who have breast cancer    .
Some late effects may be treated or controlled    .
It is important to talk with your child 's doctors about the possible late effects caused by some treatments    .
( See the PDQ summary on Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer for more information )    .
Five types of standard treatment are used :
Chemotherapy Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells , either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing    .
When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle , the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body ( systemic chemotherapy )    .
When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid , an organ , or a body cavity such as the abdomen , the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas ( regional chemotherapy )    .
Combination chemotherapy is treatment using more than one anticancer drug    .
The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the risk group    .
For example , children with low - risk Hodgkin lymphoma receive fewer cycles of treatment , fewer anticancer drugs , and lower doses of anticancer drugs than children with high - risk lymphoma    .
See Drugs Approved for Hodgkin Lymphoma for more information    .
Radiation therapy Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high - energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing    .
There are two types of radiation therapy : - External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer    .
Certain ways of giving radiation therapy can help keep radiation from damaging nearby healthy tissue    .
These types of external radiation therapy include the following : - Conformal radiation therapy : Conformal radiation therapy is a type of external radiation therapy that uses a computer to make a 3 - dimensional ( 3 - D ) picture of the tumor and shapes the radiation beams to fit the tumor    .
- Intensity - modulated radiation therapy ( IMRT ) : IMRT is a type of 3 - dimensional ( 3 - D ) radiation therapy that uses a computer to make pictures of the size and shape of the tumor    .
Thin beams of radiation of different intensities ( strengths ) are aimed at the tumor from many angles    .
- Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles , seeds , wires , or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer    .
Radiation therapy may be given , based on the childs risk group and chemotherapy regimen    .
External radiation therapy is used to treat childhood Hodgkin lymphoma    .
The radiation is given only to the lymph nodes or other areas with cancer    .
Internal radiation therapy is not used to treat Hodgkin lymphoma    .
Targeted therapy Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells    .
Monoclonal antibody therapy and proteasome inhibitor therapy are being used in the treatment of childhood Hodgkin lymphoma    .
Monoclonal antibody therapy is a cancer treatment that uses antibodies made in the laboratory from a single type of immune system cell    .
These antibodies can identify substances on cancer cells or normal substances that may help cancer cells grow    .
The antibodies attach to the substances and kill the cancer cells , block their growth , or keep them from spreading    .
Monoclonal antibodies are given by infusion    .
They may be used alone or to carry drugs , toxins , or radioactive material directly to cancer cells    .
In children , rituximab may be used to treat refractory or recurrent Hodgkin lymphoma    .
Brentuximab , nivolumab , pembrolizumab , and atezolizumab are monoclonal antibodies being studied to treat children    .
Proteasome inhibitor therapy is a type of targeted therapy that blocks the action of proteasomes ( proteins that remove other proteins the body no longer needs ) in cancer cells and may prevent the growth of tumors    .
Bortezomib is a proteasome inhibitor used to treat refractory or recurrent childhood Hodgkin lymphoma    .
Surgery Surgery may be done to remove as much of the tumor as possible for localized nodular lymphocyte - predominant childhood Hodgkin lymphoma    .
High - dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant High - dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant is a way of giving high doses of chemotherapy and replacing blood - forming cells destroyed by the cancer treatment    .
Stem cells ( immature blood cells ) are removed from the blood or bone marrow of the patient or a donor and are frozen and stored    .
After the chemotherapy is completed , the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion    .
These reinfused stem cells grow into ( and restore ) the body 's blood cells    .
See Drugs Approved for Hodgkin Lymphoma for more information    .

See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials    .
These have been retrieved from NCI 's listing of clinical trials    .
Follow - up tests may be needed    .
Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated    .
Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working    .
Decisions about whether to continue , change , or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests    .
Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended    .
The results of these tests can show if your child 's condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred ( come back )    .
These tests are sometimes called follow - up tests or check - ups    .
For patients who receive chemotherapy alone , a PET scan may be done 3 weeks or more after treatment ends    .
For patients who receive radiation therapy last , a PET scan should not be done until 8 to 12 weeks after treatment    .

Key Points
- Childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma is a disease in which malignant ( cancer ) cells form in the lymph system    .
- The main types of lymphoma are Hodgkin lymphoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma    .    - There are three major types of childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma    .
- Mature B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma - Lymphoblastic lymphoma - Anaplastic large cell lymphoma - Some types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma are rare in children    .
- Past treatment for cancer and having a weakened immune system affect the risk of having childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma    .
- Signs of childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma include breathing problems and swollen lymph nodes    .
- Tests that examine the body and lymph system are used to detect ( find ) and diagnose childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma    .    - A biopsy is done to diagnose childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma    .
- Certain factors affect prognosis ( chance of recovery ) and treatment options    .
Childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma is a disease in which malignant ( cancer ) cells form in the lymph system    .
Childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma is a type of cancer that forms in the lymph system , which is part of the body 's immune system    .
The immune system protects the body from foreign substances , infection , and diseases    .
The lymph system is made up of the following : - Lymph : Colorless , watery fluid that carries white blood cells called lymphocytes through the lymph system    .
Lymphocytes protect the body against infections and the growth of tumors    .
There are three types of lymphocytes : - B lymphocytes that make antibodies to help fight infection    .
- T lymphocytes that help B lymphocytes make the antibodies that help fight infection    .
- Natural killer cells that attack cancer cells and viruses    .
- Lymph vessels : A network of thin tubes that collect lymph from different parts of the body and return it to the bloodstream    .
- Lymph nodes : Small , bean - shaped structures that filter lymph and store white blood cells that help fight infection and disease    .
Lymph nodes are located along the network of lymph vessels found throughout the body    .
Clusters of lymph nodes are found in the neck , underarm , abdomen , pelvis , and groin    .
- Spleen :
An organ that makes lymphocytes , filters the blood , stores blood cells , and destroys old blood cells    .
The spleen is on the left side of the abdomen near the stomach    .
- Thymus :
An organ in which lymphocytes grow and multiply    .
The thymus is in the chest behind the breastbone    .
- Tonsils :
Two small masses of lymph tissue at the back of the throat    .
The tonsils make lymphocytes    .
- Bone marrow :
The soft , spongy tissue in the center of large bones    .
Bone marrow makes white blood cells , red blood cells , and platelets    .
Non-Hodgkin lymphoma can begin in B lymphocytes , T lymphocytes , or natural killer cells    .
Lymphocytes can also be found in the blood and collect in the lymph nodes , spleen , and thymus    .
Lymph tissue is also found in other parts of the body such as the stomach , thyroid gland , brain , and skin    .
Non-Hodgkin lymphoma can occur in both adults and children    .
Treatment for children is different than treatment for adults    .
See the following PDQ summaries for information about treatment of non-Hodgkin lymphoma in adults : - Adult Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma - Primary CNS Lymphoma Treatment - Mycosis Fungoides and the Sezary Syndrome Treatment
The main types of lymphoma are Hodgkin lymphoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma    .
Lymphomas are divided into two general types : Hodgkin lymphoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma    .
This summary is about the treatment of childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma    .
See the PDQ summary on Childhood Hodgkin Lymphoma Treatment for information about childhood Hodgkin lymphoma    .
There are three major types of childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma    .
The type of lymphoma is determined by how the cells look under a microscope    .
The three major types of childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma are : Mature B- cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma Mature B- cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas include : - Burkitt and Burkitt - like lymphoma / leukemia : Burkitt lymphoma and Burkitt leukemia are different forms of the same disease    .
Burkitt lymphoma / leukemia is an aggressive ( fast - growing ) disorder of B lymphocytes that is most common in children and young adults    .
It may form in the abdomen , Waldeyer 's ring , testicles , bone , bone marrow , skin , or central nervous system ( CNS )    .
Burkitt leukemia may start in the lymph nodes as Burkitt lymphoma and then spread to the blood and bone marrow , or it may start in the blood and bone marrow without forming in the lymph nodes first    .
Both Burkitt leukemia and Burkitt lymphoma have been linked to infection with the Epstein - Barr virus ( EBV ) , although EBV infection is more likely to occur in patients in Africa than in the United States    .
Burkitt and Burkitt - like lymphoma / leukemia are diagnosed when a sample of tissue is checked and a certain change to the c-myc gene is found    .
- Diffuse large B - cell lymphoma : Diffuse large B - cell lymphoma is the most common type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma    .
It is a type of B - cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma that grows quickly in the lymph nodes    .
The spleen , liver , bone marrow , or other organs are also often affected    .
Diffuse large B - cell lymphoma occurs more often in adolescents than in children    .
- Primary mediastinal B - cell lymphoma :
A type of lymphoma that develops from B cells in the mediastinum ( the area behind the breastbone )    .
It may spread to nearby organs including the lungs and the sac around the heart    .
It may also spread to lymph nodes and distant organs including the kidneys    .
In children and adolescents , primary mediastinal B - cell lymphoma occurs more often in older adolescents    .
Lymphoblastic lymphoma Lymphoblastic lymphoma is a type of lymphoma that mainly affects T - cell lymphocytes    .
It usually forms in the mediastinum ( the area behind the breastbone )    .
This causes trouble breathing , wheezing , trouble swallowing , or swelling of the head and neck    .
It may spread to lymph nodes , bone , bone marrow , skin , the CNS , abdominal organs , and other areas    .
Lymphoblastic lymphoma is a lot like acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL )    .
Anaplastic large cell lymphoma
Anaplastic large cell lymphoma is a type of lymphoma that mainly affects T - cell lymphocytes    .
It usually forms in the lymph nodes , skin , or bone , and sometimes forms in the gastrointestinal tract , lung , tissue that covers the lungs , and muscle    .
Patients with anaplastic large cell lymphoma have a receptor , called CD30 , on the surface of their T cells    .
In many children , anaplastic large cell lymphoma is marked by changes in the ALK gene that makes a protein called anaplastic lymphoma kinase    .
A pathologist checks for these cell and gene changes to help diagnose anaplastic large cell lymphoma    .
Some types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma are rare in children    .
Some types of childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma are less common    .
These include : - Pediatric - type follicular lymphoma :
In children , follicular lymphoma occurs mainly in males    .
It is more likely to be found in one area and does not spread to other places in the body    .
It usually forms in the tonsils and lymph nodes in the neck , but may also form in the testicles , kidney , gastrointestinal tract , and salivary gland    .
- Marginal zone lymphoma : Marginal zone lymphoma is a type of lymphoma that tends to grow and spread slowly and is usually found at an early stage    .
It may be found in the lymph nodes or in areas outside the lymph nodes    .
Marginal zone lymphoma found outside the lymph nodes in children is called mucosa - associated lymphoid tissue ( MALT ) lymphoma and may be linked to Helicobacter pylori infection of the gastrointestinal tract and Chlamydophila psittaci infection of the conjunctival membrane which lines the eye    .
- Primary central nervous system ( CNS ) lymphoma : Primary CNS lymphoma is extremely rare in children    .
- Peripheral T - cell lymphoma : Peripheral T - cell lymphoma is an aggressive ( fast - growing ) non-Hodgkin lymphoma that begins in mature T lymphocytes    .
The T lymphocytes mature in the thymus gland and travel to other parts of the lymph system , such as the lymph nodes , bone marrow , and spleen    .
- Cutaneous T - cell lymphoma : Cutaneous T - cell lymphoma begins in the skin and can cause the skin to thicken or form a tumor    .
It is very rare in children , but is more common in adolescents and young adults    .
There are different types of cutaneous T - cell lymphoma , such as cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma , subcutaneous panniculitis - like T - cell lymphoma , gamma - delta T - cell lymphoma , and mycosis fungoides    .
Mycosis fungoides rarely occurs in children and adolescents    .
Past treatment for cancer and having a weakened immune system affect the risk of having childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma    .
Anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor    .
Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer ; not having risk factors doesnt mean that you will not get cancer    .
Talk with your child 's doctor if you think your child may be at risk    .
Possible risk factors for childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma include the following : - Past treatment for cancer    .
- Being infected with the Epstein - Barr virus or human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV )    .
- Having a weakened immune system after a transplant or from medicines given after a transplant    .
- Having certain inherited diseases of the immune system    .
If lymphoma or lymphoproliferative disease is linked to a weakened immune system from certain inherited diseases , HIV infection , a transplant or medicines given after a transplant , the condition is called lymphoproliferative disease associated with immunodeficiency    .
The different types of lymphoproliferative disease associated with immunodeficiency include : - Lymphoproliferative disease associated with primary immunodeficiency    .
- HIV - associated non-Hodgkin lymphoma    .    - Post - transplant lymphoproliferative disease    .
What are the symptoms of Childhood Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma ?
Signs of childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma include breathing problems and swollen lymph nodes    .
These and other signs may be caused by childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma or by other conditions    .
Check with a doctor if your child has any of the following : - Trouble breathing    .
- Wheezing    .    - Coughing    .    - High - pitched breathing sounds    .
- Swelling of the head , neck , upper body , or arms    .
- Trouble swallowing    .
- Painless swelling of the lymph nodes in the neck , underarm , stomach , or groin    .
- Painless lump or swelling in a testicle    .
- Fever for no known reason    .
- Weight loss for no known reason    .
- Night sweats    .
How to diagnose Childhood Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma ?
Tests that examine the body and lymph system are used to detect ( find ) and diagnose childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma    .
The following tests and procedures may be used : - Physical exam and history :
An exam of the body to check general signs of health , including checking for signs of disease , such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual    .
A history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken    .
- Blood chemistry studies :
A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body , including electrolytes , uric acid , blood urea nitrogen ( BUN ) , creatinine , and liver function values    .
An unusual ( higher or lower than normal ) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease    .
- Liver function tests :
A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by the liver    .
A higher than normal amount of a substance can be a sign of cancer    .
- CT scan ( CAT scan ) : A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body , taken from different angles    .
The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine    .
A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly    .
This procedure is also called computed tomography , computerized tomography , or computerized axial tomography    .
- PET scan ( positron emission tomography scan ) : A procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body    .
A small amount of radioactive glucose ( sugar ) is injected into a vein    .
The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body    .
Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do    .
Sometimes a PET scan and a CT scan are done at the same time    .
If there is any cancer , this increases the chance that it will be found    .
- MRI ( magnetic resonance imaging ) : A procedure that uses a magnet , radio waves , and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body    .
This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging ( NMRI )    .
- Lumbar puncture : A procedure used to collect cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) from the spinal column    .
This is done by placing a needle between two bones in the spine and into the CSF around the spinal cord and removing a sample of the fluid    .
The sample of CSF is checked under a microscope for signs that the cancer has spread to the brain and spinal cord    .
This procedure is also called an LP or spinal tap    .
- Chest x-ray :
An x-ray of the organs and bones inside the chest    .
An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film , making a picture of areas inside the body    .
- Ultrasound exam :
A procedure in which high - energy sound waves ( ultrasound ) are bounced off internal tissues or organs and make echoes    .
The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram    .
The picture can be printed to be looked at later    .
- A biopsy is done to diagnose childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma : Cells and tissues are removed during a biopsy so they can be viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer    .
Because treatment depends on the type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma , biopsy samples should be checked by a pathologist who has experience in diagnosing childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma    .
One of the following types of biopsies may be done : - Excisional biopsy :
The removal of an entire lymph node or lump of tissue    .
- Incisional biopsy :
The removal of part of a lump , lymph node , or sample of tissue    .
- Core biopsy :
The removal of tissue or part of a lymph node using a wide needle    .
- Fine - needle aspiration ( FNA ) biopsy :
The removal of tissue or part of a lymph node using a thin needle    .
The procedure used to remove the sample of tissue depends on where the tumor is in the body : - Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy :
The removal of bone marrow and a small piece of bone by inserting a hollow needle into the hipbone or breastbone    .
- Mediastinoscopy : A surgical procedure to look at the organs , tissues , and lymph nodes between the lungs for abnormal areas    .
An incision ( cut ) is made at the top of the breastbone and a mediastinoscope is inserted into the chest    .
A mediastinoscope is a thin , tube - like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing    .
It also has a tool to remove tissue or lymph node samples , which are checked under a microscope for signs of cancer    .
- Anterior mediastinotomy : A surgical procedure to look at the organs and tissues between the lungs and between the breastbone and heart for abnormal areas    .
An incision ( cut ) is made next to the breastbone and a mediastinoscope is inserted into the chest    .
A mediastinoscope is a thin , tube - like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing    .
It also has a tool to remove tissue or lymph node samples , which are checked under a microscope for signs of cancer    .
This is also called the Chamberlain procedure    .
- Thoracentesis :
The removal of fluid from the space between the lining of the chest and the lung , using a needle    .
A pathologist views the fluid under a microscope to look for cancer cells    .
If cancer is found , the following tests may be done to study the cancer cells : - Immunohistochemistry : A laboratory test that uses antibodies to check for certain antigens in a sample of tissue    .
The antibody is usually linked to a radioactive substance or a dye that causes the tissue to light up under a microscope    .
This type of test may be used to tell the difference between different types of cancer    .
- Flow cytometry :
A laboratory test that measures the number of cells in a sample , the percentage of live cells in a sample , and certain characteristics of cells , such as size , shape , and the presence of tumor markers on the cell surface    .
The cells are stained with a light - sensitive dye , placed in a fluid , and passed in a stream before a laser or other type of light    .
The measurements are based on how the light - sensitive dye reacts to the light    .
- Cytogenetic analysis :
A laboratory test in which cells in a sample of tissue are viewed under a microscope to look for certain changes in the chromosomes    .
- FISH ( fluorescence in situ hybridization ) : A laboratory test used to look at genes or chromosomes in cells and tissues    .
Pieces of DNA that contain a fluorescent dye are made in the laboratory and added to cells or tissues on a glass slide    .
When these pieces of DNA attach to certain genes or areas of chromosomes on the slide , they light up when viewed under a microscope with a special light    .
This type of test is used to find certain gene changes    .
- Immunophenotyping :
A laboratory test used to identify cells , based on the types of antigens or markers on the surface of the cell    .
This test is used to diagnose specific types of lymphoma by comparing the cancer cells to normal cells of the immune system    .
What is the outlook for Childhood Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma ?
Certain factors affect prognosis ( chance of recovery ) and treatment options    .
The prognosis ( chance of recovery ) and treatment options depend on : - The type of lymphoma    .    - Where the tumor is in the body when the tumor is diagnosed    .
- The stage of the cancer    .    - Whether there are certain changes in the chromosomes    .
- The type of initial treatment    .
- Whether the lymphoma responded to initial treatment    .
- The patients age and general health    .
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Childhood Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma ?
New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials    .
Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website    .
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
For some patients , taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice    .
Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process    .
Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment    .
Many of today 's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials    .
Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment    .
Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future    .
Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments , they often answer important questions and help move research forward    .
Patients can enter clinical trials before , during , or after starting their cancer treatment    .
Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment    .
Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better    .
There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring ( coming back ) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment    .
Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country    .
See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials    .
These have been retrieved from NCI 's listing of clinical trials    .
What are the stages of Childhood Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma ?
Key Points
- After childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma has been diagnosed , tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the lymph system or to other parts of the body    .
- There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body    .
- The following stages are used for childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma : - Stage I - Stage II - Stage III - Stage IV
After childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma has been diagnosed , tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the lymph system or to other parts of the body    .
The process used to find out if cancer has spread within the lymph system or to other parts of the body is called staging    .
The results of tests and procedures used to diagnose non-Hodgkin lymphoma may also be used for staging    .
See the General Information section for a description of these tests and procedures    .
The information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease    .
It is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment    .
The following procedure also may be used to determine the stage : - Bone scan :
A procedure to check if there are rapidly dividing cells , such as cancer cells , in the bone    .
A very small amount of radioactive material is injected into a vein and travels through the bloodstream    .
The radioactive material collects in the bones with cancer and is detected by a scanner    .
There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body    .
Cancer can spread through tissue , the lymph system , and the blood : - Tissue    .
The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas    .
- Lymph system    .
The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system    .
The cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body    .
- Blood    .
The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood    .
The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body    .
The following stages are used for childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma :
Stage I
In stage I childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma , cancer is found : - in one group of lymph nodes ; or - in one area outside the lymph nodes    .
No cancer is found in the abdomen or mediastinum ( area between the lungs )    .
Stage II
In stage II childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma , cancer is found : - in one area outside the lymph nodes and in nearby lymph nodes ; or - in two or more areas either above or below the diaphragm , and may have spread to nearby lymph nodes ; or - to have started in the stomach or intestines and can be completely removed by surgery    .
Cancer may have spread to certain nearby lymph nodes    .
Stage III
In stage III childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma , cancer is found : - in at least one area above the diaphragm and in at least one area below the diaphragm ; or - to have started in the chest ; or - to have started in the abdomen and spread throughout the abdomen ; or - in the area around the spine    .
Stage IV
In stage IV childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma , cancer is found in the bone marrow , brain , or cerebrospinal fluid    .
Cancer may also be found in other parts of the body    .
What are the treatments for Childhood Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma ?
Key Points
- There are different types of treatment for children with non-Hodgkin lymphoma    .
- Children with non-Hodgkin lymphoma should have their treatment planned by a team of doctors who are experts in treating childhood cancer    .
- Some cancer treatments cause side effects months or years after treatment has ended    .
- Six types of standard treatment are used : - Chemotherapy - Radiation therapy - High - dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant - Targeted therapy - Other drug therapy - Phototherapy - New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials    .
- Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
- Patients can enter clinical trials before , during , or after starting their cancer treatment    .
- Follow - up tests may be needed    .
There are different types of treatment for children with non-Hodgkin lymphoma    .
Different types of treatment are available for children with non-Hodgkin lymphoma    .
Some treatments are standard ( the currently used treatment ) , and some are being tested in clinical trials    .
A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer    .
When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment , the new treatment may become the standard treatment    .
Taking part in a clinical trial should be considered for all children with non-Hodgkin lymphoma    .
Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment    .
Children with non-Hodgkin lymphoma should have their treatment planned by a team of doctors who are experts in treating childhood cancer    .
Treatment will be overseen by a pediatric oncologist , a doctor who specializes in treating children with cancer    .
The pediatric oncologist works with other health care providers who are experts in treating children with non-Hodgkin lymphoma and who specialize in certain areas of medicine    .
These may include the following specialists : - Pediatrician    .    - Radiation oncologist    .
- Pediatric hematologist    .
- Pediatric surgeon    .
- Pediatric nurse specialist    .
- Rehabilitation specialist    .
- Psychologist    .    - Social worker    .
Some cancer treatments cause side effects months or years after treatment has ended    .
Side effects from cancer treatment that begin during or after treatment and continue for months or years are called late effects    .
Late effects of cancer treatment may include the following : - Physical problems    .
- Changes in mood , feelings , thinking , learning , or memory    .
- Second cancers ( new types of cancer )    .
Some late effects may be treated or controlled    .
It is important to talk with your child 's doctors about the effects cancer treatment can have on your child    .
( See the PDQ summary on Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer for more information    .    )
Six types of standard treatment are used :
Chemotherapy Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells , either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing    .
When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle , the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body ( systemic chemotherapy )    .
Combination chemotherapy is treatment using two or more anticancer drugs    .
The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated    .
Intrathecal chemotherapy may be used to treat childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma that has spread , or may spread , to the brain    .
When used to lessen the chance cancer will spread to the brain , it is called CNS prophylaxis    .
Intrathecal chemotherapy is given in addition to chemotherapy by mouth or vein    .
Higher than usual doses of chemotherapy may also be used as CNS prophylaxis    .
See Drugs Approved for Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma for more information    .
Radiation therapy Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing    .
There are two types of radiation therapy : - External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer    .
- Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles , seeds , wires , or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer    .
The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma being treated    .
External radiation therapy may be used to treat childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma that has spread , or may spread , to the brain and spinal cord    .
Internal radiation therapy is not used to treat non-Hodgkin lymphoma    .
High - dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant
This treatment is a way of giving high doses of chemotherapy and then replacing blood - forming cells destroyed by the cancer treatment    .
Stem cells ( immature blood cells ) are removed from the bone marrow or blood of the patient or a donor and are frozen and stored    .
After the chemotherapy is completed , the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion    .
These reinfused stem cells grow into ( and restore ) the bodys blood cells    .
See Drugs Approved for Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma for more information    .
Targeted therapy Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells    .
Monoclonal antibodies , tyrosine kinase inhibitors , and immunotoxins are three types of targeted therapy being used or studied in the treatment of childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma    .
Monoclonal antibody therapy is a cancer treatment that uses antibodies made in the laboratory from a single type of immune system cell    .
These antibodies can identify substances on cancer cells or normal substances that may help cancer cells grow    .
The antibodies attach to the substances and kill the cancer cells , block their growth , or keep them from spreading    .
Monoclonal antibodies are given by infusion    .
They may be used alone or to carry drugs , toxins , or radioactive material directly to cancer cells    .
- Rituximab is used to treat several types of childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma    .
- Brentuximab vedotin is a monoclonal antibody combined with an anticancer drug that is used to treat anaplastic large cell lymphoma    .
A bispecific monoclonal antibody is made up of two different monoclonal antibodies that bind to two different substances and kills cancer cells    .
Tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( TKIs ) block signals that tumors need to grow    .
Some TKIs also keep tumors from growing by preventing the growth of new blood vessels to the tumors    .
Other types of kinase inhibitors , such as crizotinib , are being studied for childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma    .
Immunotoxins can bind to cancer cells and kill them    .
Denileukin diftitox is an immunotoxin used to treat cutaneous T - cell lymphoma    .
See Drugs Approved for Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma for more information    .
Other drug therapy Retinoids are drugs related to vitamin A   .    Retinoid therapy with bexarotene is used to treat several types of cutaneous T - cell lymphoma    .
Steroids are hormones made naturally in the body    .
They can also be made in a laboratory and used as drugs    .
Steroid therapy is used to treat cutaneous T - cell lymphoma    .
Phototherapy Phototherapy is a cancer treatment that uses a drug and a certain type of laser light to kill cancer cells    .
A drug that is not active until it is exposed to light is injected into a vein    .
The drug collects more in cancer cells than in normal cells    .
For skin cancer in the skin , laser light is shined onto the skin and the drug becomes active and kills the cancer cells    .
Phototherapy is used in the treatment of cutaneous T - cell lymphoma    .
New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials    .
Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website    .
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
For some patients , taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice    .
Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process    .
Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment    .

Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country    .
See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials    .
These have been retrieved from NCI 's listing of clinical trials    .
Follow - up tests may be needed    .
Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated    .
Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working    .
Decisions about whether to continue , change , or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests    .
Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended    .
The results of these tests can show if your child 's condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred ( come back )    .
These tests are sometimes called follow - up tests or check - ups    .

What is (are) Anal Cancer ?
Key Points
- Anal cancer is a disease in which malignant ( cancer ) cells form in the tissues of the anus    .
- Squamous cell carcinoma is the most common type of anal cancer    .
- In the United States , the number of new cases of anal cancer has increased in recent years    .
Anal cancer is a disease in which malignant ( cancer ) cells form in the tissues of the anus    .
The anus is the end of the large intestine , below the rectum , through which stool ( solid waste ) leaves the body    .
The anus is formed partly from the outer skin layers of the body and partly from the intestine    .
Two ring - like muscles , called sphincter muscles , open and close the anal opening and let stool pass out of the body    .
The anal canal , the part of the anus between the rectum and the anal opening , is about 1 - 1 inches long    .
The skin around the outside of the anus is called the perianal area    .
Tumors in this area are skin tumors , not anal cancer    .
See the following PDQ summary for more information about anal cancer : - Anal Cancer Treatment
Squamous cell carcinoma is the most common type of anal cancer    .
In the United States , the most common type of anal cancer is squamous cell carcinoma    .
Studies show that human papillomavirus ( HPV ) infection is the main cause of this type of anal cancer    .
Another type of anal cancer , called anal adenocarcinoma , is very rare and is not discussed in this summary    .
In the United States , the number of new cases of anal cancer has increased in recent years    .
From 2004 to 2013 , new cases of anal cancer and deaths from anal cancer increased each year    .
The increase in new cases was slightly higher in women and the increase in deaths from anal cancer was slightly higher in men    .
Who is at risk for Anal Cancer? ?
Being infected with the human papillomavirus ( HPV ) increases the risk of developing anal cancer    .
Risk factors include the following : - Being infected with human papillomavirus ( HPV )    .
- Having many sexual partners    .
- Having receptive anal intercourse ( anal sex )    .
- Being older than 50 years    .
- Frequent anal redness , swelling , and soreness    .
- Having anal fistulas ( abnormal openings )    .
- Smoking cigarettes    .
What are the symptoms of Anal Cancer ?
Signs of anal cancer include bleeding from the anus or rectum or a lump near the anus    .
These and other signs and symptoms may be caused by anal cancer or by other conditions    .
Check with your doctor if you have any of the following : - Bleeding from the anus or rectum    .
- Pain or pressure in the area around the anus    .
- Itching or discharge from the anus    .    - A lump near the anus    .    - A change in bowel habits    .
How to diagnose Anal Cancer ?
Tests that examine the rectum and anus are used to detect ( find ) and diagnose anal cancer    .
The following tests and procedures may be used : - Physical exam and history :
An exam of the body to check general signs of health , including checking for signs of disease , such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual    .
A history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken    .
- Digital rectal examination ( DRE ) : An exam of the anus and rectum    .
The doctor or nurse inserts a lubricated , gloved finger into the lower part of the rectum to feel for lumps or anything else that seems unusual    .
- Anoscopy :
An exam of the anus and lower rectum using a short , lighted tube called an anoscope    .
- Proctoscopy :
An exam of the rectum using a short , lighted tube called a proctoscope    .
- Endo-anal or endorectal ultrasound :
A procedure in which an ultrasound transducer ( probe ) is inserted into the anus or rectum and used to bounce high - energy sound waves ( ultrasound ) off internal tissues or organs and make echoes    .
The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram    .
- Biopsy :
The removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer    .
If an abnormal area is seen during the anoscopy , a biopsy may be done at that time    .
What is the outlook for Anal Cancer ?
Certain factors affect the prognosis ( chance of recovery ) and treatment options    .
The prognosis ( chance of recovery ) depends on the following : - The size of the tumor    .    - Where the tumor is in the anus    .
- Whether the cancer has spread to the lymph nodes    .
The treatment options depend on the following : - The stage of the cancer    .    - Where the tumor is in the anus    .
- Whether the patient has human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV )    .
- Whether cancer remains after initial treatment or has recurred    .
What are the stages of Anal Cancer ?
Key Points
- After anal cancer has been diagnosed , tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the anus or to other parts of the body    .
- There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body    .
- Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body    .
- The following stages are used for anal cancer : - Stage 0 ( Carcinoma in Situ ) - Stage I - Stage II - Stage IIIA - Stage IIIB - Stage IV
After anal cancer has been diagnosed , tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the anus or to other parts of the body    .
The process used to find out if cancer has spread within the anus or to other parts of the body is called staging    .
The information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease    .
It is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment    .
The following tests may be used in the staging process : - CT scan ( CAT scan ) :
A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body , such as the abdomen or chest , taken from different angles    .
The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine    .
A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly    .
This procedure is also called computed tomography , computerized tomography , or computerized axial tomography    .
For anal cancer , a CT scan of the pelvis and abdomen may be done    .
- Chest x-ray :
An x-ray of the organs and bones inside the chest    .
An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film , making a picture of areas inside the body    .
- MRI ( magnetic resonance imaging ) : A procedure that uses a magnet , radio waves , and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body    .
This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging ( NMRI )    .
- PET scan ( positron emission tomography scan ) : A procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body    .
A small amount of radioactive glucose ( sugar ) is injected into a vein    .
The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body    .
Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do    .
There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body    .
The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas    .
- Lymph system    .
The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system    .
The cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body    .
- Blood    .
The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood    .
The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body    .
Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body    .
When cancer spreads to another part of the body , it is called metastasis    .
Cancer cells break away from where they began ( the primary tumor ) and travel through the lymph system or blood    .
- Lymph system    .
The cancer gets into the lymph system , travels through the lymph vessels , and forms a tumor ( metastatic tumor ) in another part of the body    .
- Blood    .
The cancer gets into the blood , travels through the blood vessels , and forms a tumor ( metastatic tumor ) in another part of the body    .
The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor    .
For example , if anal cancer spreads to the lung , the cancer cells in the lung are actually anal cancer cells    .
The disease is metastatic anal cancer , not lung cancer    .
The following stages are used for anal cancer :
Stage 0 ( Carcinoma in Situ )
In stage 0 , abnormal cells are found in the innermost lining of the anus    .
These abnormal cells may become cancer and spread into nearby normal tissue    .
Stage 0 is also called carcinoma in situ    .
Stage I
In stage I , cancer has formed and the tumor is 2 centimeters or smaller    .
Stage II
In stage II , the tumor is larger than 2 centimeters    .
Stage IIIA
In stage IIIA , the tumor may be any size and has spread to either : - lymph nodes near the rectum ; or - nearby organs , such as the vagina , urethra , and bladder    .
Stage IIIB
In stage IIIB , the tumor may be any size and has spread : - to nearby organs and to lymph nodes near the rectum ; or - to lymph nodes on one side of the pelvis and / or groin , and may have spread to nearby organs ; or - to lymph nodes near the rectum and in the groin , and / or to lymph nodes on both sides of the pelvis and / or groin , and may have spread to nearby organs    .
Stage IV
In stage IV , the tumor may be any size and cancer may have spread to lymph nodes or nearby organs and has spread to distant parts of the body    .
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Anal Cancer ?
New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials    .
This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials    .
It may not mention every new treatment being studied    .
Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website    .
Radiosensitizers Radiosensitizers are drugs that make tumor cells more sensitive to radiation therapy    .
Combining radiation therapy with radiosensitizers may kill more tumor cells    .
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
For some patients , taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice    .
Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process    .
Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment    .
Many of today 's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials    .
Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment    .
Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future    .
Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments , they often answer important questions and help move research forward    .
Patients can enter clinical trials before , during , or after starting their cancer treatment    .
Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment    .
Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better    .
There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring ( coming back ) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment    .
Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country    .
See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials    .
These have been retrieved from NCI 's listing of clinical trials    .
What are the treatments for Anal Cancer ?
Key Points
- There are different types of treatment for patients with anal cancer    .
- Three types of standard treatment are used : - Radiation therapy - Chemotherapy - Surgery - Having the human immunodeficiency virus can affect treatment of anal cancer    .
- New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials    .
- Radiosensitizers - Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
- Patients can enter clinical trials before , during , or after starting their cancer treatment    .
- Follow - up tests may be needed    .
There are different types of treatment for patients with anal cancer    .
Different types of treatments are available for patients with anal cancer    .
Some treatments are standard ( the currently used treatment ) , and some are being tested in clinical trials    .
A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer    .
When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment , the new treatment may become the standard treatment    .
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment    .
Three types of standard treatment are used :
Radiation therapy Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high - energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing    .
There are two types of radiation therapy : - External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer    .
- Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles , seeds , wires , or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer    .
The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated    .
External and internal radiation therapy are used to treat anal cancer    .
Chemotherapy Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells , either by killing the cells or by stopping the cells from dividing    .
When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle , the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body ( systemic chemotherapy )    .
When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid , an organ , or a body cavity such as the abdomen , the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas ( regional chemotherapy )    .
The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated    .
Surgery - Local resection : A surgical procedure in which the tumor is cut from the anus along with some of the healthy tissue around it    .
Local resection may be used if the cancer is small and has not spread    .
This procedure may save the sphincter muscles so the patient can still control bowel movements    .
Tumors that form in the lower part of the anus can often be removed with local resection    .
- Abdominoperineal resection : A surgical procedure in which the anus , the rectum , and part of the sigmoid colon are removed through an incision made in the abdomen    .
The doctor sews the end of the intestine to an opening , called a stoma , made in the surface of the abdomen so body waste can be collected in a disposable bag outside of the body    .
This is called a colostomy    .
Lymph nodes that contain cancer may also be removed during this operation    .
Having the human immunodeficiency virus can affect treatment of anal cancer    .
Cancer therapy can further damage the already weakened immune systems of patients who have the human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV )    .
For this reason , patients who have anal cancer and HIV are usually treated with lower doses of anticancer drugs and radiation than patients who do not have HIV    .
New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials    .

These have been retrieved from NCI 's listing of clinical trials    .
Follow - up tests may be needed    .
Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated    .
Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working    .
Decisions about whether to continue , change , or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests    .
Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended    .
The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred ( come back )    .
These tests are sometimes called follow - up tests or check - ups    .

How to prevent Anal Cancer ?
Key Points
- Avoiding risk factors and increasing protective factors may help prevent cancer    .    - The following are risk factors for anal cancer : - Anal HPV infection - Certain medical conditions - History of cervical , vaginal , or vulvar cancer - HIV infection / AIDS - Immunosuppression - Certain sexual practices - Cigarette smoking - The following protective factor decreases the risk of anal cancer : - HPV vaccine - It is not clear if the following protective factor decreases the risk of anal cancer : - Condom use - Cancer prevention clinical trials are used to study ways to prevent cancer    .
- New ways to prevent anal cancer are being studied in clinical trials    .
Avoiding risk factors and increasing protective factors may help prevent cancer    .
Avoiding cancer risk factors may help prevent certain cancers    .
Risk factors include smoking , being overweight , and not getting enough exercise    .
Increasing protective factors such as quitting smoking and exercising may also help prevent some cancers    .
Talk to your doctor or other health care professional about how you might lower your risk of cancer    .
The following are risk factors for anal cancer :
Anal HPV infection Being infected with human papillomavirus ( HPV ) is the main risk factor for anal cancer    .
Being infected with HPV can lead to squamous cell carcinoma of the anus , the most common type of anal cancer    .
About nine out of every ten cases of anal cancer are found in patients with anal HPV infection    .
Patients with healthy immune systems are usually able to fight HPV infections    .
Patients with weakened immune systems who are infected with HPV have a higher risk of anal cancer    .
Certain medical conditions
History of cervical , vaginal , or vulvar cancer Cervical cancer , vaginal cancer , and vulvar cancer are related to HPV infection    .
Women who have had cervical , vaginal , or vulvar cancer have a higher risk of anal cancer    .
HIV infection / AIDS Being infected with human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) is a strong risk factor for anal cancer    .
HIV is the cause of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS )    .
HIV weakens the body 's immune system and its ability to fight infection    .
HPV infection of the anus is common among patients who are HIV - positive    .
The risk of anal cancer is higher in men who are HIV - positive and have sex with men compared with men who are HIV - negative and have sex with men    .
Women who are HIV - positive also have an increased risk of anal cancer compared with women who are HIV - negative    .
Studies show that intravenous drug use or cigarette smoking may further increase the risk of anal cancer in patients who are HIV - positive    .
Immunosuppression Immunosuppression is a condition that weakens the body 's immune system and its ability to fight infections and other diseases    .
Chronic ( long - term ) immunosuppression may increase the risk of anal cancer because it lowers the body 's ability to fight HPV infection    .
Patients who have an organ transplant and receive immunosuppressive medicine to prevent organ rejection have an increased risk of anal cancer    .
Having an autoimmune disorder such as Crohn disease or psoriasis may increase the risk of anal cancer    .
It is not clear if the increased risk is due to the autoimmune condition , the treatment for the condition , or a combination of both    .
Certain sexual practices
The following sexual practices increase the risk of anal cancer because they increase the chance of being infected with HPV : - Having receptive anal intercourse ( anal sex )    .
- Having many sexual partners    .    - Sex between men    .
Men and women who have a history of anal warts or other sexually transmitted diseases also have an increased risk of anal cancer    .
Cigarette smoking Studies show that cigarette smoking increases the risk of anal cancer    .
Studies also show that current smokers have a higher risk of anal cancer than smokers who have quit or people who have never smoked    .
The following protective factor decreases the risk of anal cancer :
HPV vaccine
The human papillomavirus ( HPV ) vaccine is used to prevent anal cancer , cervical cancer , vulvar cancer , and vaginal cancer caused by HPV    .
It is also used to prevent lesions caused by HPV that may become cancer in the future    .
Studies show that being vaccinated against HPV lowers the risk of anal cancer    .
The vaccine may work best when it is given before a person is exposed to HPV    .
It is not clear if the following protective factor decreases the risk of anal cancer :
Condom use
It is not known if the use of condoms protects against anal HPV infection    .
This is because not enough studies have been done to prove this    .
Cancer prevention clinical trials are used to study ways to prevent cancer    .
Cancer prevention clinical trials are used to study ways to lower the risk of developing certain types of cancer    .
Some cancer prevention trials are conducted with healthy people who have not had cancer but who have an increased risk for cancer    .
Other prevention trials are conducted with people who have had cancer and are trying to prevent another cancer of the same type or to lower their chance of developing a new type of cancer    .
Other trials are done with healthy volunteers who are not known to have any risk factors for cancer    .
The purpose of some cancer prevention clinical trials is to find out whether actions people take can prevent cancer    .
These may include eating fruits and vegetables , exercising , quitting smoking , or taking certain medicines , vitamins , minerals , or food supplements    .
New ways to prevent anal cancer are being studied in clinical trials    .
Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country    .
Information about clinical trials for anal cancer prevention can be found in the Clinical Trials section of the NCI Web site    .
What is (are) Adult Central Nervous System Tumors ?
Key Points
- An adult central nervous system tumor is a disease in which abnormal cells form in the tissues of the brain and / or spinal cord    .    - A tumor that starts in another part of the body and spreads to the brain is called a metastatic brain tumor    .
- The brain controls many important body functions    .
- The spinal cord connects the brain to nerves in most parts of the body    .
- There are different types of brain and spinal cord tumors    .
- Astrocytic Tumors - Oligodendroglial Tumors - Mixed Gliomas - Ependymal Tumors - Medulloblastomas - Pineal Parenchymal Tumors - Meningeal Tumors - Germ Cell Tumors - Craniopharyngioma ( Grade I ) - Having certain genetic syndromes may increase the risk of a central nervous system tumor    .
- The cause of most adult brain and spinal cord tumors is not known    .
- The signs and symptoms of adult brain and spinal cord tumors are not the same in every person    .
- Tests that examine the brain and spinal cord are used to diagnose adult brain and spinal cord tumors    .    - A biopsy is also used to diagnose a brain tumor    .
- Sometimes a biopsy or surgery cannot be done    .
- Certain factors affect prognosis ( chance of recovery ) and treatment options    .
An adult central nervous system tumor is a disease in which abnormal cells form in the tissues of the brain and / or spinal cord    .
There are many types of brain and spinal cord tumors    .
The tumors are formed by the abnormal growth of cells and may begin in different parts of the brain or spinal cord    .
Together , the brain and spinal cord make up the central nervous system ( CNS )    .
The tumors may be either benign ( not cancer ) or malignant ( cancer ) : - Benign brain and spinal cord tumors grow and press on nearby areas of the brain    .
They rarely spread into other tissues and may recur ( come back )    .
- Malignant brain and spinal cord tumors are likely to grow quickly and spread into other brain tissue    .
When a tumor grows into or presses on an area of the brain , it may stop that part of the brain from working the way it should    .
Both benign and malignant brain tumors cause signs and symptoms and need treatment    .
Brain and spinal cord tumors can occur in both adults and children    .
However , treatment for children may be different than treatment for adults    .
( See the PDQ summary on Childhood Brain and Spinal Cord Tumors Treatment Overview for more information on the treatment of children    .    )
For information about lymphoma that begins in the brain , see the PDQ summary on Primary CNS Lymphoma Treatment    .
A tumor that starts in another part of the body and spreads to the brain is called a metastatic brain tumor    .
Tumors that start in the brain are called primary brain tumors    .
Primary brain tumors may spread to other parts of the brain or to the spine    .
They rarely spread to other parts of the body    .
Often , tumors found in the brain have started somewhere else in the body and spread to one or more parts of the brain    .
These are called metastatic brain tumors ( or brain metastases )    .
Metastatic brain tumors are more common than primary brain tumors    .
Up to half of metastatic brain tumors are from lung cancer    .
Other types of cancer that commonly spread to the brain include : - Melanoma    .    - Breast cancer    .    - Colon cancer    .    - Kidney cancer    .    - Nasopharyngeal cancer    .    - Cancer of unknown primary site    .
Cancer may spread to the leptomeninges ( the two innermost membranes covering the brain and spinal cord )    .
This is called leptomeningeal carcinomatosis    .
The most common cancers that spread to the leptomeninges include : - Breast cancer    .    - Lung cancer    .    - Leukemia    .    - Lymphoma    .
See the following for more information from PDQ about cancers that commonly spread to the brain or spinal cord : - Adult Hodgkin Lymphoma Treatment - Adult Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Treatment - Breast Cancer Treatment - Carcinoma of Unknown Primary Treatment - Colon Cancer Treatment - Leukemia Home Page - Melanoma Treatment - Nasopharyngeal Cancer Treatment - Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Treatment - Renal Cell Cancer Treatment - Small Cell Lung Cancer Treatment
The brain controls many important body functions    .
The brain has three major parts : - The cerebrum is the largest part of the brain    .
It is at the top of the head    .
The cerebrum controls thinking , learning , problem solving , emotions , speech , reading , writing , and voluntary movement    .
- The cerebellum is in the lower back of the brain ( near the middle of the back of the head )    .
It controls movement , balance , and posture    .    - The brain stem connects the brain to the spinal cord    .
It is in the lowest part of the brain ( just above the back of the neck )    .
The brain stem controls breathing , heart rate , and the nerves and muscles used to see , hear , walk , talk , and eat    .
The spinal cord connects the brain to nerves in most parts of the body    .
The spinal cord is a column of nerve tissue that runs from the brain stem down the center of the back    .
It is covered by three thin layers of tissue called membranes    .
These membranes are surrounded by the vertebrae ( back bones )    .
Spinal cord nerves carry messages between the brain and the rest of the body , such as a message from the brain to cause muscles to move or a message from the skin to the brain to feel touch    .
There are different types of brain and spinal cord tumors    .
Brain and spinal cord tumors are named based on the type of cell they formed in and where the tumor first formed in the CNS    .
The grade of a tumor may be used to tell the difference between slow - growing and fast - growing types of the tumor    .
The World Health Organization ( WHO ) tumor grades are based on how abnormal the cancer cells look under a microscope and how quickly the tumor is likely to grow and spread    .
WHO Tumor Grading System - Grade I ( low - grade )
The tumor cells look more like normal cells under a microscope and grow and spread more slowly than grade II , III , and IV tumor cells    .
They rarely spread into nearby tissues    .
Grade I brain tumors may be cured if they are completely removed by surgery    .
- Grade II
The tumor cells grow and spread more slowly than grade III and IV tumor cells    .
They may spread into nearby tissue and may recur ( come back )    .
Some tumors may become a higher - grade tumor    .
- Grade III
The tumor cells look very different from normal cells under a microscope and grow more quickly than grade I and II tumor cells    .
They are likely to spread into nearby tissue    .
- Grade IV ( high - grade )
The tumor cells do not look like normal cells under a microscope and grow and spread very quickly    .
There may be areas of dead cells in the tumor    .
Grade IV tumors usually cannot be cured    .
The following types of primary tumors can form in the brain or spinal cord : Astrocytic Tumors
An astrocytic tumor begins in star - shaped brain cells called astrocytes , which help keep nerve cells healthy    .
An astrocyte is a type of glial cell    .
Glial cells sometimes form tumors called gliomas    .
Astrocytic tumors include the following : - Brain stem glioma ( usually high grade ) : A brain stem glioma forms in the brain stem , which is the part of the brain connected to the spinal cord    .
It is often a high - grade tumor , which spreads widely through the brain stem and is hard to cure    .
Brain stem gliomas are rare in adults    .
( See the PDQ summary on Childhood Brain Stem Glioma Treatment for more information    .    )
- Pineal astrocytic tumor ( any grade ) : A pineal astrocytic tumor forms in tissue around the pineal gland and may be any grade    .
The pineal gland is a tiny organ in the brain that makes melatonin , a hormone that helps control the sleeping and waking cycle    .
- Pilocytic astrocytoma ( grade I ) : A pilocytic astrocytoma grows slowly in the brain or spinal cord    .
It may be in the form of a cyst and rarely spreads into nearby tissues    .
Pilocytic astrocytomas can often be cured    .
- Diffuse astrocytoma ( grade II ) : A diffuse astrocytoma grows slowly , but often spreads into nearby tissues    .
The tumor cells look something like normal cells    .
In some cases , a diffuse astrocytoma can be cured    .
It is also called a low - grade diffuse astrocytoma    .
- Anaplastic astrocytoma ( grade III ) :
An anaplastic astrocytoma grows quickly and spreads into nearby tissues    .

Who is at risk for Adult Central Nervous System Tumors? ?
Having certain genetic syndromes may increase the risk of a central nervous system tumor    .
Anything that increases your chance of getting a disease is called a risk factor    .
Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer ; not having risk factors doesnt mean that you will not get cancer    .
Talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk    .
There are few known risk factors for brain tumors    .
The following conditions may increase the risk of certain types of brain tumors : - Being exposed to vinyl chloride may increase the risk of glioma    .
- Infection with the Epstein - Barr virus , having AIDS ( acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ) , or receiving an organ transplant may increase the risk of primary CNS lymphoma    .
( See the PDQ summary on Primary CNS Lymphoma for more information    .    ) - Having certain genetic syndromes may increase the risk brain tumors : - Neurofibromatosis type 1 ( NF1 ) or 2 ( NF2 )    .    - von Hippel - Lindau disease    .
- Tuberous sclerosis    .
- Li-Fraumeni syndrome    .    - Turcot syndrome type 1 or 2    .    - Nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome    .
What causes Adult Central Nervous System Tumors ?
The cause of most adult brain and spinal cord tumors is not known    .
What are the symptoms of Adult Central Nervous System Tumors ?
The signs and symptoms of adult brain and spinal cord tumors are not the same in every person    .
- What the affected part of the brain controls    .
- The size of the tumor    .
Signs and symptoms may be caused by CNS tumors or by other conditions , including cancer that has spread to the brain    .
- Loss of appetite    .
- Frequent nausea and vomiting    .
- Changes in personality , mood , ability to focus , or behavior    .
- Loss of balance and trouble walking    .
- Weakness    .    - Unusual sleepiness or change in activity level    .
Spinal Cord Tumor Symptoms - Back pain or pain that spreads from the back towards the arms or legs    .
- A change in bowel habits or trouble urinating    .
- Weakness or numbness in the arms or legs    .
- Trouble walking    .
How to diagnose Adult Central Nervous System Tumors ?
Tests that examine the brain and spinal cord are used to diagnose adult brain and spinal cord tumors    .
The following tests and procedures may be used : - Physical exam and history :
An exam of the body to check general signs of health , including checking for signs of disease , such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual    .
A history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken    .
- Neurological exam :
A series of questions and tests to check the brain , spinal cord , and nerve function    .
The exam checks a persons mental status , coordination , and ability to walk normally , and how well the muscles , senses , and reflexes work    .
This may also be called a neuro exam or a neurologic exam    .
- Visual field exam :
An exam to check a persons field of vision ( the total area in which objects can be seen )    .
This test measures both central vision ( how much a person can see when looking straight ahead ) and peripheral vision ( how much a person can see in all other directions while staring straight ahead )    .
Any loss of vision may be a sign of a tumor that has damaged or pressed on the parts of the brain that affect eyesight    .
- Tumor marker test :
A procedure in which a sample of blood , urine , or tissue is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances made by organs , tissues , or tumor cells in the body    .
Certain substances are linked to specific types of cancer when found in increased levels in the body    .
These are called tumor markers    .
This test may be done to diagnose a germ cell tumor    .
- Gene testing :
A laboratory test in which a sample of blood or tissue is tested for changes in a chromosome that has been linked with a certain type of brain tumor    .
This test may be done to diagnose an inherited syndrome    .
- CT scan ( CAT scan ) : A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body , taken from different angles    .
The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine    .
A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly    .
This procedure is also called computed tomography , computerized tomography , or computerized axial tomography    .
- MRI ( magnetic resonance imaging ) with gadolinium :
A procedure that uses a magnet , radio waves , and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of the brain and spinal cord    .
A substance called gadolinium is injected into a vein    .
The gadolinium collects around the cancer cells so they show up brighter in the picture    .
This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging ( NMRI )    .
MRI is often used to diagnose tumors in the spinal cord    .
Sometimes a procedure called magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( MRS ) is done during the MRI scan    .
An MRS is used to diagnose tumors , based on their chemical make - up    .
- SPECT scan ( single photon emission computed tomography scan ) :
A procedure that uses a special camera linked to a computer to make a 3 - dimensional ( 3 - D ) picture of the brain    .
A very small amount of a radioactive substance is injected into a vein or inhaled through the nose    .
As the substance travels through the blood , the camera rotates around the head and takes pictures of the brain    .
Blood flow and metabolism are higher than normal in areas where cancer cells are growing    .
These areas will show up brighter in the picture    .
This procedure may be done just before or after a CT scan    .
SPECT is used to tell the difference between a primary tumor and a tumor that has spread to the brain from somewhere else in the body    .
- PET scan ( positron emission tomography scan ) : A procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body    .
A small amount of radioactive glucose ( sugar ) is injected into a vein    .
The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the brain    .
Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do    .
PET is used to tell the difference between a primary tumor and a tumor that has spread to the brain from somewhere else in the body    .
A biopsy is also used to diagnose a brain tumor    .
If imaging tests show there may be a brain tumor , a biopsy is usually done    .
One of the following types of biopsies may be used : - Stereotactic biopsy :
When imaging tests show there may be a tumor deep in the brain in a hard to reach place , a stereotactic brain biopsy may be done    .
This kind of biopsy uses a computer and a 3 - dimensional ( 3 - D ) scanning device to find the tumor and guide the needle used to remove the tissue    .
A small incision is made in the scalp and a small hole is drilled through the skull    .
A biopsy needle is inserted through the hole to remove cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer    .
- Open biopsy :
When imaging tests show that there may be a tumor that can be removed by surgery , an open biopsy may be done    .
A part of the skull is removed in an operation called a craniotomy    .
A sample of brain tissue is removed and viewed under a microscope by a pathologist    .
If cancer cells are found , some or all of the tumor may be removed during the same surgery    .
Tests are done before surgery to find the areas around the tumor that are important for normal brain function    .
There are also ways to test brain function during surgery    .
The doctor will use the results of these tests to remove as much of the tumor as possible with the least damage to normal tissue in the brain    .
The pathologist checks the biopsy sample to find out the type and grade of brain tumor    .
The grade of the tumor is based on how the tumor cells look under a microscope and how quickly the tumor is likely to grow and spread    .
The following tests may be done on the tumor tissue that is removed : - Immunohistochemistry :
A test that uses antibodies to check for certain antigens in a sample of tissue    .
The antibody is usually linked to a radioactive substance or a dye that causes the tissue to light up under a microscope    .
This type of test may be used to tell the difference between different types of cancer    .
- Light and electron microscopy :
A laboratory test in which cells in a sample of tissue are viewed under regular and high - powered microscopes to look for certain changes in the cells    .
- Cytogenetic analysis :
A laboratory test in which cells in a sample of tissue are viewed under a microscope to look for certain changes in the chromosomes    .
Sometimes a biopsy or surgery cannot be done    .
For some tumors , a biopsy or surgery cannot be done safely because of where the tumor formed in the brain or spinal cord    .
These tumors are diagnosed and treated based on the results of imaging tests and other procedures    .
Sometimes the results of imaging tests and other procedures show that the tumor is very likely to be benign and a biopsy is not done    .
What is the outlook for Adult Central Nervous System Tumors ?
Certain factors affect prognosis ( chance of recovery ) and treatment options    .
The prognosis ( chance of recovery ) and treatment options for primary brain and spinal cord tumors depend on the following : - The type and grade of the tumor    .
- Where the tumor is in the brain or spinal cord    .
- Whether the tumor can be removed by surgery    .
- Whether cancer cells remain after surgery    .
- Whether there are certain changes in the chromosomes    .
- Whether the cancer has just been diagnosed or has recurred ( come back )    .
- The patient 's general health    .
The prognosis and treatment options for metastatic brain and spinal cord tumors depend on the following : - Whether there are more than two tumors in the brain or spinal cord    .
- Where the tumor is in the brain or spinal cord    .
- How well the tumor responds to treatment    .
- Whether the primary tumor continues to grow or spread    .
What are the stages of Adult Central Nervous System Tumors ?
Key Points
- There is no standard staging system for adult brain and spinal cord tumors    .
- Imaging tests may be repeated after surgery to help plan more treatment    .
There is no standard staging system for adult brain and spinal cord tumors    .
The extent or spread of cancer is usually described as stages    .
There is no standard staging system for brain and spinal cord tumors    .
Brain tumors that begin in the brain may spread to other parts of the brain and spinal cord , but they rarely spread to other parts of the body    .
Treatment of primary brain and spinal cord tumors is based on the following : - The type of cell in which the tumor began    .
- Where the tumor formed in the brain or spinal cord    .
- The amount of cancer left after surgery    .
- The grade of the tumor    .
Treatment of tumors that have spread to the brain from other parts of the body is based on the number of tumors in the brain    .
Imaging tests may be repeated after surgery to help plan more treatment    .
Some of the tests and procedures used to diagnose a brain or spinal cord tumor may be repeated after treatment to find out how much tumor is left    .
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Adult Central Nervous System Tumors ?
New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials    .
This summary section refers to new treatments being studied in clinical trials , but it may not mention every new treatment being studied    .
Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website    .
Proton beam radiation therapy Proton beam radiation therapy is a type of high - energy , external radiation therapy that uses streams of protons ( small , positively - charged pieces of matter ) to make radiation    .
This type of radiation kills tumor cells with little damage to nearby tissues    .
It is used to treat cancers of the head , neck , and spine and organs such as the brain , eye , lung , and prostate    .
Proton beam radiation is different from x-ray radiation    .
Biologic therapy Biologic therapy is a treatment that uses the patients immune system to fight cancer    .
Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost , direct , or restore the bodys natural defenses against cancer    .
This type of cancer treatment is also called biotherapy or immunotherapy    .
Biologic therapy is being studied for the treatment of some types of brain tumors    .
Treatments may include the following : - Dendritic cell vaccine therapy    .    - Gene therapy    .
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
For some patients , taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice    .
Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process    .
Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment    .
Many of today 's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials    .
Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment    .
Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future    .
Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments , they often answer important questions and help move research forward    .
Patients can enter clinical trials before , during , or after starting their cancer treatment    .
Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment    .
Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better    .
There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring ( coming back ) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment    .
Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country    .
See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials    .

What are the treatments for Adult Central Nervous System Tumors ?
Key Points
- There are different types of treatment for patients with adult brain and spinal cord tumors    .
- Five types of standard treatment are used : - Active surveillance - Surgery - Radiation therapy - Chemotherapy - Targeted therapy - Supportive care is given to lessen the problems caused by the disease or its treatment    .
- New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials    .
- Proton beam radiation therapy - Biologic therapy - Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
- Patients can enter clinical trials before , during , or after starting their cancer treatment    .
- Follow - up tests may be needed    .
There are different types of treatment for patients with adult brain and spinal cord tumors    .
Different types of treatment are available for patients with adult brain and spinal cord tumors    .
Some treatments are standard ( the currently used treatment ) , and some are being tested in clinical trials    .
A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer    .
When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment , the new treatment may become the standard treatment    .
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment    .
Five types of standard treatment are used :
Active surveillance Active surveillance is closely watching a patients condition but not giving any treatment unless there are changes in test results that show the condition is getting worse    .
Active surveillance may be used to avoid or delay the need for treatments such as radiation therapy or surgery , which can cause side effects or other problems    .
During active surveillance , certain exams and tests are done on a regular schedule    .
Active surveillance may be used for very slow - growing tumors that do not cause symptoms    .
Surgery Surgery may be used to diagnose and treat adult brain and spinal cord tumors    .
Removing tumor tissue helps decrease pressure of the tumor on nearby parts of the brain    .
See the General Information section of this summary    .
Even if the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery , some patients may be given chemotherapy or radiation therapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left    .
Treatment given after the surgery , to lower the risk that the cancer will come back , is called adjuvant therapy    .
Radiation therapy Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high - energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing    .
Certain ways of giving radiation therapy can help keep radiation from damaging nearby healthy tissue    .
- Intensity - modulated radiation therapy ( IMRT ) : IMRT is a type of 3 - dimensional ( 3 - D ) external radiation therapy that uses a computer to make pictures of the size and shape of the tumor    .
Thin beams of radiation of different intensities ( strengths ) are aimed at the tumor from many angles    .
- Stereotactic radiosurgery : Stereotactic radiosurgery is a type of external radiation therapy    .
A rigid head frame is attached to the skull to keep the head still during the radiation treatment    .
A machine aims a single large dose of radiation directly at the tumor    .
This procedure does not involve surgery    .
It is also called stereotaxic radiosurgery , radiosurgery , and radiation surgery    .
- Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles , seeds , wires , or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer    .
The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and grade of tumor and where it is in the brain or spinal cord    .
External radiation therapy is used to treat adult central nervous system tumors    .
Chemotherapy Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells , either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing    .
When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle , the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body ( systemic chemotherapy )    .
When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid , an organ , or a body cavity such as the abdomen , the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas ( regional chemotherapy )    .
Combination chemotherapy is treatment using more than one anticancer drug    .
To treat brain tumors , a wafer that dissolves may be used to deliver an anticancer drug directly to the brain tumor site after the tumor has been removed by surgery    .
The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and grade of tumor and where it is in the brain    .
Anticancer drugs given by mouth or vein to treat brain and spinal cord tumors cannot cross the blood - brain barrier and enter the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord    .
Instead , an anticancer drug is injected into the fluid - filled space to kill cancer cells there    .
This is called intrathecal chemotherapy    .
See Drugs Approved for Brain Tumors for more information    .
Targeted therapy Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells    .
Monoclonal antibody therapy is a type of targeted therapy that uses antibodies made in the laboratory from a single type of immune system cell    .
These antibodies can identify substances on cancer cells or normal substances that may help cancer cells grow    .
The antibodies attach to the substances and kill the cancer cells , block their growth , or keep them from spreading    .
Monoclonal antibodies are given by infusion    .
They may be used alone or to carry drugs , toxins , or radioactive material directly to cancer cells    .
Bevacizumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to a protein called vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) and may prevent the growth of new blood vessels that tumors need to grow    .
Bevacizumab is used in the treatment of recurrent glioblastoma    .
Other types of targeted therapies are being studied for adult brain tumors , including tyrosine kinase inhibitors and new VEGF inhibitors    .
See Drugs Approved for Brain Tumors for more information    .
Supportive care is given to lessen the problems caused by the disease or its treatment    .
This therapy controls problems or side effects caused by the disease or its treatment and improves quality of life    .
For brain tumors , supportive care includes drugs to control seizures and fluid buildup or swelling in the brain    .
New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials    .

These have been retrieved from NCI 's listing of clinical trials    .
Follow - up tests may be needed    .
Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated    .
Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working    .
Decisions about whether to continue , change , or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests    .
Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended    .
The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred ( come back )    .
These tests are sometimes called follow - up tests or check - ups    .
The following tests and procedures may be used to check whether a brain tumor has come back after treatment : - SPECT scan ( single photon emission computed tomography scan ) :
A procedure that uses a special camera linked to a computer to make a 3 - dimensional ( 3 - D ) picture of the brain    .
A very small amount of a radioactive substance is injected into a vein or inhaled through the nose    .
As the substance travels through the blood , the camera rotates around the head and takes pictures of the brain    .
Blood flow and metabolism are higher than normal in areas where cancer cells are growing    .
These areas will show up brighter in the picture    .
This procedure may be done just before or after a CT scan    .
- PET scan ( positron emission tomography scan ) : A procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body    .
A small amount of radioactive glucose ( sugar ) is injected into a vein    .
The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the brain    .
Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do    .

- Certain factors affect prognosis ( chance of recovery )    .
A childhood brain or spinal cord tumor is a disease in which abnormal cells form in the tissues of the brain or spinal cord    .
There are many types of childhood brain and spinal cord tumors    .
The tumors are formed by the abnormal growth of cells and may begin in different areas of the brain or spinal cord    .
The tumors may be benign ( not cancer ) or malignant ( cancer )    .
Benign brain tumors grow and press on nearby areas of the brain    .
They rarely spread into other tissues    .
Malignant brain tumors are likely to grow quickly and spread into other brain tissue    .
When a tumor grows into or presses on an area of the brain , it may stop that part of the brain from working the way it should    .
Both benign and malignant brain tumors can cause signs or symptoms and need treatment    .
Together , the brain and spinal cord make up the central nervous system ( CNS )    .
The brain controls many important body functions    .
The brain has three major parts : - The cerebrum is the largest part of the brain    .
It is at the top of the head    .
The cerebrum controls thinking , learning , problem solving , emotions , speech , reading , writing , and voluntary movement    .
- The cerebellum is in the lower back of the brain ( near the middle of the back of the head )    .
It controls movement , balance , and posture    .    - The brain stem connects the brain to the spinal cord    .
It is in the lowest part of the brain ( just above the back of the neck )    .
The brain stem controls breathing , heart rate , and the nerves and muscles used in seeing , hearing , walking , talking , and eating    .
The spinal cord connects the brain with nerves in most parts of the body    .
The spinal cord is a column of nerve tissue that runs from the brain stem down the center of the back    .
It is covered by three thin layers of tissue called membranes    .
These membranes are surrounded by the vertebrae ( back bones )    .
Spinal cord nerves carry messages between the brain and the rest of the body , such as a message from the brain to cause muscles to move or a message from the skin to the brain to feel touch    .
Brain and spinal cord tumors are a common type of childhood cancer    .
Although cancer is rare in children , brain and spinal cord tumors are the third most common type of childhood cancer , after leukemia and lymphoma    .
Brain tumors can occur in both children and adults    .
Treatment for children is usually different than treatment for adults    .
( See the PDQ summary on Adult Central Nervous System Tumors Treatment for more information about the treatment of adults    .    )
This summary describes the treatment of primary brain and spinal cord tumors ( tumors that begin in the brain and spinal cord )    .
Treatment of metastatic brain and spinal cord tumors is not covered in this summary    .
Metastatic tumors are formed by cancer cells that begin in other parts of the body and spread to the brain or spinal cord    .
What causes Childhood Brain and Spinal Cord Tumors ?
The cause of most childhood brain and spinal cord tumors is unknown    .
What are the symptoms of Childhood Brain and Spinal Cord Tumors ?
The signs and symptoms of childhood brain and spinal cord tumors are not the same in every child    .
Signs and symptoms depend on the following : - Where the tumor forms in the brain or spinal cord    .
- The size of the tumor    .
- How fast the tumor grows    .
- The child 's age and development    .
Signs and symptoms may be caused by childhood brain and spinal cord tumors or by other conditions , including cancer that has spread to the brain    .
Check with your child 's doctor if your child has any of the following : Brain Tumor Signs and Symptoms - Morning headache or headache that goes away after vomiting    .
- Frequent nausea and vomiting    .
- Vision , hearing , and speech problems    .
- Loss of balance and trouble walking    .
- Unusual sleepiness or change in activity level    .
- Unusual changes in personality or behavior    .
- Seizures    .    - Increase in the head size ( in infants )    .
Spinal Cord Tumor Signs and Symptoms - Back pain or pain that spreads from the back towards the arms or legs    .
- A change in bowel habits or trouble urinating    .
- Weakness in the legs    .
- Trouble walking    .
In addition to these signs and symptoms of brain and spinal cord tumors , some children are unable to reach certain growth and development milestones such as sitting up , walking , and talking in sentences    .
How to diagnose Childhood Brain and Spinal Cord Tumors ?
Tests that examine the brain and spinal cord are used to detect ( find ) childhood brain and spinal cord tumors    .
The following tests and procedures may be used : - Physical exam and history :
An exam of the body to check general signs of health , including checking for signs of disease , such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual    .
A history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken    .
- Neurological exam :
A series of questions and tests to check the brain , spinal cord , and nerve function    .
The exam checks a persons mental status , coordination , and ability to walk normally , and how well the muscles , senses , and reflexes work    .
This may also be called a neuro exam or a neurologic exam    .
- MRI ( magnetic resonance imaging ) with gadolinium :
A procedure that uses a magnet , radio waves , and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of the brain and spinal cord    .
A substance called gadolinium is injected into a vein    .
This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging ( NMRI )    .
- Serum tumor marker test :
A procedure in which a sample of blood is examined to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs , tissues , or tumor cells in the body    .
Certain substances are linked to specific types of cancer when found in increased levels in the blood    .
These are called tumor markers    .
Most childhood brain tumors are diagnosed and removed in surgery    .
If doctors think there might be a brain tumor , a biopsy may be done to remove a sample of tissue    .
For tumors in the brain , the biopsy is done by removing part of the skull and using a needle to remove a sample of tissue    .
A pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells    .
If cancer cells are found , the doctor may remove as much tumor as safely possible during the same surgery    .
The pathologist checks the cancer cells to find out the type and grade of brain tumor    .
The grade of the tumor is based on how abnormal the cancer cells look under a microscope and how quickly the tumor is likely to grow and spread    .
The following test may be done on the sample of tissue that is removed : - Immunohistochemistry :
A test that uses antibodies to check for certain antigens in a sample of tissue    .
The antibody is usually linked to a radioactive substance or a dye that causes the tissue to light up under a microscope    .
This type of test may be used to tell the difference between different types of cancer    .
Some childhood brain and spinal cord tumors are diagnosed by imaging tests    .
Sometimes a biopsy or surgery cannot be done safely because of where the tumor formed in the brain or spinal cord    .
These tumors are diagnosed based on the results of imaging tests and other procedures    .
What is the outlook for Childhood Brain and Spinal Cord Tumors ?
Certain factors affect prognosis ( chance of recovery )    .
The prognosis ( chance of recovery ) depends on the following : - Whether there are any cancer cells left after surgery    .
- The type of tumor    .    - Where the tumor is in the body    .
- The child 's age    .
- Whether the tumor has just been diagnosed or has recurred ( come back )    .
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Childhood Brain and Spinal Cord Tumors ?
New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials    .
This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials    .
It may not mention every new treatment being studied    .
Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website    .
High - dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant High - dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant is a way of giving high doses of chemotherapy and replacing blood - forming cells destroyed by the cancer treatment    .
Stem cells ( immature blood cells ) are removed from the blood or bone marrow of the patient or a donor and are frozen and stored    .
After the chemotherapy is completed , the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion    .
These reinfused stem cells grow into ( and restore ) the bodys blood cells    .
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
For some patients , taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice    .
Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process    .
Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment    .
Many of today 's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials    .
Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment    .
Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future    .
Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments , they often answer important questions and help move research forward    .
Patients can enter clinical trials before , during , or after starting their cancer treatment    .
Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment    .
Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better    .
There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring ( coming back ) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment    .
Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country    .
Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website    .
What are the treatments for Childhood Brain and Spinal Cord Tumors ?
Key Points
- There are different types of treatment for children with brain and spinal cord tumors    .
- Children with brain or spinal cord tumors should have their treatment planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating childhood brain and spinal cord tumors    .
- Childhood brain and spinal cord tumors may cause signs or symptoms that begin before the cancer is diagnosed and continue for months or years    .
- Some cancer treatments cause side effects months or years after treatment has ended    .
- Three types of standard treatment are used : - Surgery - Radiation therapy - Chemotherapy - New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials    .
- High - dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant - Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
- Patients can enter clinical trials before , during , or after starting their cancer treatment    .
- Follow - up tests may be needed    .
There are different types of treatment for children with brain and spinal cord tumors    .
Different types of treatment are available for children with brain and spinal cord tumors    .
Some treatments are standard ( the currently used treatment ) , and some are being tested in clinical trials    .
A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer    .
When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment , the new treatment may become the standard treatment    .
Because cancer in children is rare , taking part in a clinical trial should be considered    .
Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country    .
Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment    .
Children with brain or spinal cord tumors should have their treatment planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating childhood brain and spinal cord tumors    .
Treatment will be overseen by a pediatric oncologist , a doctor who specializes in treating children with cancer    .
The pediatric oncologist works with other health care providers who are experts in treating children with brain tumors and who specialize in certain areas of medicine    .
These may include the following specialists : - Pediatrician    .    - Neurosurgeon    .    - Neurologist    .    - Neuro - oncologist    .
- Neuropathologist    .
- Neuroradiologist    .
- Radiation oncologist    .
- Endocrinologist    .    - Psychologist    .    - Ophthalmologist    .
- Rehabilitation specialist    .
- Social worker    .
- Nurse specialist    .
Childhood brain and spinal cord tumors may cause signs or symptoms that begin before the cancer is diagnosed and continue for months or years    .
Childhood brain and spinal cord tumors may cause signs or symptoms that continue for months or years    .
Signs or symptoms caused by the tumor may begin before diagnosis    .
Signs or symptoms caused by treatment may begin during or right after treatment    .
Some cancer treatments cause side effects months or years after treatment has ended    .
These are called late effects    .
Late effects of cancer treatment may include the following : - Physical problems    .
- Changes in mood , feelings , thinking , learning , or memory    .
- Second cancers ( new types of cancer )    .
Some late effects may be treated or controlled    .
It is important to talk with your child 's doctors about the effects cancer treatment can have on your child    .
( See the PDQ summary on Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer for more information )    .
Three types of standard treatment are used :
Surgery Surgery may be used to diagnose and treat childhood brain and spinal cord tumors    .
See the General Information section of this summary    .
Radiation therapy Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high - energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing    .
There are two types of radiation therapy : - External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer    .
- Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles , seeds , wires , or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer    .
The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type of cancer being treated    .
External radiation therapy is used to treat childhood brain and spinal cord tumors    .
Chemotherapy Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells , either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing    .
When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle , the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body ( systemic chemotherapy )    .
When chemotherapy is placed directly in the cerebrospinal fluid , an organ , or a body cavity such as the abdomen , the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas ( regional chemotherapy )    .
The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated    .
Anticancer drugs given by mouth or vein to treat brain and spinal cord tumors cannot cross the blood - brain barrier and enter the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord    .
Instead , an anticancer drug is injected into the fluid - filled space to kill cancer cells there    .
This is called intrathecal chemotherapy    .
New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials    .
This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials    .
It may not mention every new treatment being studied    .

Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website    .
Follow - up tests may be needed    .
Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated    .
Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working    .
Decisions about whether to continue , change , or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests    .
Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended    .
The results of these tests can show if your child 's condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred ( come back )    .
These tests are sometimes called follow - up tests or check - ups    .
What is (are) Childhood Astrocytomas ?
Key Points
- Childhood astrocytoma is a disease in which benign ( noncancer ) or malignant ( cancer ) cells form in the tissues of the brain    .

Childhood astrocytoma is a disease in which benign ( noncancer ) or malignant ( cancer ) cells form in the tissues of the brain    .
Astrocytomas are tumors that start in star - shaped brain cells called astrocytes    .
An astrocyte is a type of glial cell    .
Glial cells hold nerve cells in place , bring food and oxygen to them , and help protect them from disease , such as infection    .
Gliomas are tumors that form from glial cells    .
An astrocytoma is a type of glioma    .
Astrocytoma is the most common type of glioma diagnosed in children    .
It can form anywhere in the central nervous system ( brain and spinal cord )    .
This summary is about the treatment of tumors that begin in astrocytes in the brain ( primary brain tumors )    .
Metastatic brain tumors are formed by cancer cells that begin in other parts of the body and spread to the brain    .
Treatment of metastatic brain tumors is not discussed here    .
Brain tumors can occur in both children and adults    .
However , treatment for children may be different than treatment for adults    .
See the following PDQ summaries for more information about other types of brain tumors in children and adults : - Childhood Brain and Spinal Cord Tumors Treatment Overview - Adult Central Nervous System Tumors Treatment
Astrocytomas may be benign ( not cancer ) or malignant ( cancer )    .
Benign brain tumors grow and press on nearby areas of the brain    .
They rarely spread into other tissues    .
Malignant brain tumors are likely to grow quickly and spread into other brain tissue    .
When a tumor grows into or presses on an area of the brain , it may stop that part of the brain from working the way it should    .
Both benign and malignant brain tumors can cause signs and symptoms and almost all need treatment    .
The central nervous system controls many important body functions    .
Astrocytomas are most common in these parts of the central nervous system ( CNS ) : - Cerebrum :
The largest part of the brain , at the top of the head    .
The cerebrum controls thinking , learning , problem - solving , speech , emotions , reading , writing , and voluntary movement    .
- Cerebellum :
The lower , back part of the brain ( near the middle of the back of the head )    .
The cerebellum controls movement , balance , and posture    .
- Brain stem :
The part that connects the brain to the spinal cord , in the lowest part of the brain ( just above the back of the neck )    .
The brain stem controls breathing , heart rate , and the nerves and muscles used in seeing , hearing , walking , talking , and eating    .
- Hypothalamus :
The area in the middle of the base of the brain    .
It controls body temperature , hunger , and thirst    .
- Visual pathway :
The group of nerves that connect the eye with the brain    .
- Spinal cord :
The column of nerve tissue that runs from the brain stem down the center of the back    .
It is covered by three thin layers of tissue called membranes    .
The spinal cord and membranes are surrounded by the vertebrae ( back bones )    .
Spinal cord nerves carry messages between the brain and the rest of the body , such as a message from the brain to cause muscles to move or a message from the skin to the brain to feel touch    .
What causes Childhood Astrocytomas ?
The cause of most childhood brain tumors is not known    .
Who is at risk for Childhood Astrocytomas? ?
Anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor    .
Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer ; not having risk factors doesnt mean that you will not get cancer    .
Talk with your child 's doctor if you think your child may be at risk    .
Possible risk factors for astrocytoma include : - Past radiation therapy to the brain    .
- Having certain genetic disorders , such as neurofibromatosis type 1 ( NF1 ) or tuberous sclerosis    .
What are the symptoms of Childhood Astrocytomas ?
The signs and symptoms of astrocytomas are not the same in every child    .
Signs and symptoms depend on the following : - Where the tumor forms in the brain or spinal cord    .
- The size of the tumor    .
- How fast the tumor grows    .
- The child 's age and development    .
Some tumors do not cause signs or symptoms    .
Signs and symptoms may be caused by childhood astrocytomas or by other conditions    .
Check with your child 's doctor if your child has any of the following : - Morning headache or headache that goes away after vomiting    .
- Nausea and vomiting    .
- Vision , hearing , and speech problems    .
- Loss of balance and trouble walking    .
- Worsening handwriting or slow speech    .

How to diagnose Childhood Astrocytomas ?
Tests that examine the brain and spinal cord are used to detect ( find ) childhood astrocytomas    .
The following tests and procedures may be used : - Physical exam and history :
An exam of the body to check general signs of health    .
This includes checking for signs of disease , such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual    .
A history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken    .
- Neurological exam :
A series of questions and tests to check the brain , spinal cord , and nerve function    .
The exam checks a persons mental status , coordination , and ability to walk normally , and how well the muscles , senses , and reflexes work    .
This may also be called a neuro exam or a neurologic exam    .
- Visual field exam :
An exam to check a persons field of vision ( the total area in which objects can be seen )    .
This test measures both central vision ( how much a person can see when looking straight ahead ) and peripheral vision ( how much a person can see in all other directions while staring straight ahead )    .
The eyes are tested one at a time    .
The eye not being tested is covered    .
- MRI ( magnetic resonance imaging ) with gadolinium :
A procedure that uses a magnet , radio waves , and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of the brain and spinal cord    .
A substance called gadolinium is injected into a vein    .
The gadolinium collects around the cancer cells so they show up brighter in the picture    .
This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging ( NMRI )    .
Sometimes magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( MRS ) is done during the same MRI scan to look at the chemical makeup of the brain tissue    .
Childhood astrocytomas are usually diagnosed and removed in surgery    .
If doctors think there may be an astrocytoma , a biopsy may be done to remove a sample of tissue    .
For tumors in the brain , a part of the skull is removed and a needle is used to remove tissue    .
Sometimes , the needle is guided by a computer    .
A pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells    .
If cancer cells are found , the doctor may remove as much tumor as safely possible during the same surgery    .
Because it can be hard to tell the difference between types of brain tumors , you may want to have your child 's tissue sample checked by a pathologist who has experience in diagnosing brain tumors    .
The following test may be done on the tissue that was removed : - Immunohistochemistry :
A test that uses antibodies to check for certain antigens in a sample of tissue    .
The antibody is usually linked to a radioactive substance or a dye that causes the tissue to light up under a microscope    .
This type of test may be used to tell the difference between different types of cancer    .
An MIB - 1 test is a type of immunohistochemistry that checks tumor tissue for an antigen called MIB - 1    .
This may show how fast a tumor is growing    .
Sometimes tumors form in a place that makes them hard to remove    .
If removing the tumor may cause severe physical , emotional , or learning problems , a biopsy is done and more treatment is given after the biopsy    .
Children who have NF1 may form a low - grade astrocytoma in the area of the brain that controls vision and may not need a biopsy    .
If the tumor does not continue to grow or symptoms do not occur , surgery to remove the tumor may not be needed    .
What is the outlook for Childhood Astrocytomas ?
Certain factors affect prognosis ( chance of recovery ) and treatment options    .
The prognosis ( chance of recovery ) and treatment options depend on the following : - Whether the tumor is a low - grade or high - grade astrocytoma    .    - Where the tumor has formed in the CNS and if it has spread to nearby tissue or to other parts of the body    .
- How fast the tumor is growing    .
- The child 's age    .
- Whether cancer cells remain after surgery    .
- Whether there are changes in certain genes    .
- Whether the child has NF1 or tuberous sclerosis    .
- Whether the child has diencephalic syndrome ( a condition which slows physical growth )    .
- Whether the child has intracranial hypertension ( cerebrospinal fluid pressure within the skull is high ) at the time of diagnosis    .
- Whether the astrocytoma has just been diagnosed or has recurred ( come back )    .
For recurrent astrocytoma , prognosis and treatment depend on how much time passed between the time treatment ended and the time the astrocytoma recurred    .
What are the stages of Childhood Astrocytomas ?
Key Points
- The grade of the tumor is used to plan cancer treatment    .
- Low - grade astrocytomas - High - grade astrocytomas - An MRI is done after surgery    .
The grade of the tumor is used to plan cancer treatment    .
Staging is the process used to find out how much cancer there is and if cancer has spread    .
It is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment    .
There is no standard staging system for childhood astrocytoma    .
Treatment is based on the following : - Whether the tumor is low grade or high grade    .
- Whether the tumor is newly diagnosed or recurrent ( has come back after treatment )    .
The grade of the tumor describes how abnormal the cancer cells look under a microscope and how quickly the tumor is likely to grow and spread    .
The following grades are used : Low - grade astrocytomas
Low - grade astrocytomas are slow - growing and rarely spread to other parts of the brain and spinal cord or other parts of the body    .
There are many types of low - grade astrocytomas    .
Low - grade astrocytomas can be either : - Grade I tumors pilocytic astrocytoma , subependymal giant cell tumor , or angiocentric glioma    .
- Grade II tumors diffuse astrocytoma , pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma , or choroid glioma of the third ventricle    .
Children who have neurofibromatosis type 1 may have more than one low - grade tumor in the brain    .
Children who have tuberous sclerosis have an increased risk of subependymal giant cell astrocytoma    .
High - grade astrocytomas
High - grade astrocytomas are fast - growing and often spread within the brain and spinal cord    .
There are several types of high - grade astrocytomas    .
High grade astrocytomas can be either : - Grade III tumors anaplastic astrocytoma or anaplastic pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma    .
- Grade IV tumors glioblastoma or diffuse midline glioma    .
Childhood astrocytomas usually do not spread to other parts of the body    .
An MRI is done after surgery    .
An MRI ( magnetic resonance imaging ) is done in the first few days after surgery    .
This is to find out how much tumor , if any , remains after surgery and to plan further treatment    .
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Childhood Astrocytomas ?
New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials    .
This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials    .
It may not mention every new treatment being studied    .
Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website    .
Other drug therapy Lenalidomide is a type of angiogenesis inhibitor    .
It prevents the growth of new blood vessels that are needed by a tumor to grow    .
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
For some patients , taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice    .
Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process    .
Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment    .
Many of today 's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials    .
Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment    .
Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future    .
Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments , they often answer important questions and help move research forward    .
Patients can enter clinical trials before , during , or after starting their cancer treatment    .
Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment    .
Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better    .
There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring ( coming back ) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment    .
Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country    .
See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials    .
These have been retrieved from NCI 's listing of clinical trials    .
What are the treatments for Childhood Astrocytomas ?
Key Points
- There are different types of treatment for patients with childhood astrocytoma    .
- Children with astrocytomas should have their treatment planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating childhood brain tumors    .
- Childhood brain tumors may cause signs or symptoms that begin before the cancer is diagnosed and continue for months or years    .
- Some cancer treatments cause side effects months or years after treatment has ended    .
- Six types of treatment are used : - Surgery - Observation - Radiation therapy - Chemotherapy - High - dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant - Targeted therapy - New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials    .
- Other drug therapy - If fluid builds up around the brain and spinal cord , a cerebrospinal fluid diversion procedure may be done    .
- Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
- Patients can enter clinical trials before , during , or after starting their cancer treatment    .
- Follow - up tests may be needed    .
There are different types of treatment for patients with childhood astrocytoma    .
Different types of treatment are available for children with astrocytomas    .
Some treatments are standard ( the currently used treatment ) , and some are being tested in clinical trials    .
A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer    .
When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment , the new treatment may become the standard treatment    .
Because cancer in children is rare , taking part in a clinical trial should be considered    .
Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment    .
Children with astrocytomas should have their treatment planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating childhood brain tumors    .
Treatment will be overseen by a pediatric oncologist , a doctor who specializes in treating children with cancer    .
The pediatric oncologist works with other healthcare providers who are experts in treating children with brain tumors and who specialize in certain areas of medicine    .
These may include the following specialists : - Pediatrician    .    - Pediatric neurosurgeon    .    - Neurologist    .    - Neuropathologist    .
- Neuroradiologist    .
- Rehabilitation specialist    .
- Radiation oncologist    .
- Endocrinologist    .    - Psychologist    .
Childhood brain tumors may cause signs or symptoms that begin before the cancer is diagnosed and continue for months or years    .
Signs or symptoms caused by the tumor may begin before diagnosis    .
These signs or symptoms may continue for months or years    .
It is important to talk with your child 's doctors about signs or symptoms caused by the tumor that may continue after treatment    .
Some cancer treatments cause side effects months or years after treatment has ended    .
Side effects from cancer treatment that begin during or after treatment and continue for months or years are called late effects    .
Late effects of cancer treatment may include the following : - Physical problems    .
- Changes in mood , feelings , thinking , learning , or memory    .
- Second cancers ( new types of cancer )    .
Some late effects may be treated or controlled    .
It is important to talk with your child 's doctors about the effects cancer treatment can have on your child    .
( See the PDQ summary on Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer for more information    .    )
Six types of treatment are used :
Surgery Surgery is used to diagnose and treat childhood astrocytoma , as discussed in the General Information section of this summary    .
If cancer cells remain after surgery , further treatment depends on : - Where the remaining cancer cells are    .
- The grade of the tumor    .    - The age of the child    .
Even if the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery , some patients may be given chemotherapy or radiation therapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that remain    .
Treatment given after the surgery , to lower the risk that the cancer will come back , is called adjuvant therapy    .
Observation Observation is closely monitoring a patients condition without giving any treatment until signs or symptoms appear or change    .
Observation may be used : - If the patient has no symptoms , such as patients with neurofibromatosis type1    .
- If the tumor is small and is found when a different health problem is being diagnosed or treated    .
- After the tumor is removed by surgery until signs or symptoms appear or change    .
Radiation therapy Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high - energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing    .
There are two types of radiation therapy : - External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer    .
Certain ways of giving radiation therapy can help keep radiation from damaging nearby healthy tissue    .
These types of radiation therapy include the following : - Conformal radiation therapy : Conformal radiation therapy is a type of external radiation therapy that uses a computer to make a 3 - dimensional ( 3 - D ) picture of the tumor and shapes the radiation beams to fit the tumor    .
- Intensity - modulated radiation therapy ( IMRT ) : IMRT is a type of 3 - dimensional ( 3 - D ) external radiation therapy that uses a computer to make pictures of the size and shape of the tumor    .
Thin beams of radiation of different intensities ( strengths ) are aimed at the tumor from many angles    .
- Stereotactic radiation therapy : Stereotactic radiation therapy is a type of external radiation therapy    .
A rigid head frame is attached to the skull to keep the head still during the radiation treatment    .
A machine aims radiation directly at the tumor    .
The total dose of radiation is divided into several smaller doses given over several days    .
This procedure is also called stereotactic external - beam radiation therapy and stereotaxic radiation therapy    .
- Proton beam radiation therapy : Proton - beam therapy is a type of high - energy , external radiation therapy    .
A radiation therapy machine aims streams of protons ( tiny , invisible , positively - charged particles ) at the cancer cells to kill them    .
- Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles , seeds , wires , or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer    .
The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type of tumor and where the tumor formed in the brain or spinal cord    .
External radiation therapy is used to treat childhood astrocytomas    .
Radiation therapy to the brain can affect growth and development , especially in young children    .
For children younger than 3 years , chemotherapy may be given instead , to delay or reduce the need for radiation therapy    .
Chemotherapy Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells , either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing    .
When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle , the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body ( systemic chemotherapy )    .
When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid , an organ , or a body cavity such as the abdomen , the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas ( regional chemotherapy )    .
Combination chemotherapy is the use of more than one anticancer drug    .
The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type of tumor and where the tumor formed in the brain or spinal cord    .
Systemic combination chemotherapy is used in the treatment of children with astrocytoma    .
High - dose chemotherapy may be used in the treatment of children with newly diagnosed high - grade astrocytoma    .
High - dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant High - dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant is a way of giving high doses of chemotherapy and replacing blood - forming cells destroyed by the cancer treatment    .
Stem cells ( immature blood cells ) are removed from the blood or bone marrow of the patient or a donor and are frozen and stored    .
After the chemotherapy is completed , the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion    .
These reinfused stem cells grow into ( and restore ) the body 's blood cells    .
For high - grade astrocytoma that has come back after treatment , high - dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant is used if there is only a small amount of tumor    .
Targeted therapy Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells    .
There are different types of targeted therapy : - Monoclonal antibody therapy uses antibodies made in the laboratory , from a single type of immune system cell , to stop cancer cells    .
These antibodies can identify substances on cancer cells or normal substances that may help cancer cells grow    .
The antibodies attach to the substances and kill the cancer cells , block their growth , or keep them from spreading    .
Monoclonal antibodies are given by infusion into a vein    .
They may be used alone or to carry drugs , toxins , or radioactive material directly to cancer cells    .
There are different types of monoclonal antibody therapy : - Vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) inhibitor therapy : Cancer cells make a substance called VEGF , which causes new blood vessels to form ( angiogenesis ) and helps the cancer grow    .
VEGF inhibitors block VEGF and stop new blood vessels from forming    .
This may kill cancer cells because they need new blood vessels to grow    .
Bevacizumab is a VEGF inhibitor and angiogenesis inhibitor being used to treat childhood astrocytoma    .
- Immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy : PD - 1 is a protein on the surface of T cells that helps keep the bodys immune responses in check    .
When PD - 1 attaches to another protein called PDL - 1 on a cancer cell , it stops the T cell from killing the cancer cell    .
PD - 1 inhibitors attach to PDL - 1 and allow the T cells to kill cancer cells    .
PD - 1 inhibitors are being studied to treat high - grade astrocytoma that has recurred    .
- Protein kinase inhibitors work in different ways    .
There are several kinds of protein kinase inhibitors    .
- mTOR inhibitors stop cells from dividing and may prevent the growth of new blood vessels that tumors need to grow    .
Everolimus and sirolimus are mTOR inhibitors used to treat childhood subependymal giant cell astrocytomas    .
mTOR inhibitors also are being studied to treat low - grade astrocytoma that has recurred    .
- BRAF inhibitors block proteins needed for cell growth and may kill cancer cells    .
The BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib is being studied to treat low - grade astrocytoma that has recurred    .
Vemurafenib and dabrafenib have been used to treat high - grade astrocytomas that have recurred but more study is needed to know how well they work in children    .
- MEK inhibitors block proteins needed for cell growth and may kill cancer cells    .
MEK inhibitors such as selumetinib are being studied to treat low - grade astrocytoma that has recurred    .
See Drugs Approved for Brain Tumors for more information    .
New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials    .
This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials    .
It may not mention every new treatment being studied    .
Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website    .
Other drug therapy Lenalidomide is a type of angiogenesis inhibitor    .
It prevents the growth of new blood vessels that are needed by a tumor to grow    .
If fluid builds up around the brain and spinal cord , a cerebrospinal fluid diversion procedure may be done    .
Cerebrospinal fluid diversion is a method used to drain fluid that has built up around the brain and spinal cord    .
A shunt ( long , thin tube ) is placed in a ventricle ( fluid - filled space ) of the brain and threaded under the skin to another part of the body , usually the abdomen    .
The shunt carries extra fluid away from the brain so it may be absorbed elsewhere in the body    .
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
For some patients , taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice    .
Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process    .
Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment    .
Many of today 's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials    .

These have been retrieved from NCI 's listing of clinical trials    .
Follow - up tests may be needed    .
Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated    .
( See the General Information section for a list of tests    .    )
Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working    .
Decisions about whether to continue , change , or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests    .
Regular MRIs will continue to be done after treatment has ended    .
The results of the MRI can show if your child 's condition has changed or if the astrocytoma has recurred ( come back )    .
If the results of the MRI show a mass in the brain , a biopsy may be done to find out if it is made up of dead tumor cells or if new cancer cells are growing    .
Treatment Options for Childhood Astrocytomas
Newly Diagnosed Childhood Low - Grade Astrocytomas
When the tumor is first diagnosed , treatment for childhood low - grade astrocytoma depends on where the tumor is , and is usually surgery    .
An MRI is done after surgery to see if there is tumor remaining    .
If the tumor was completely removed by surgery , more treatment may not be needed and the child is closely watched to see if signs or symptoms appear or change    .
This is called observation    .
If there is tumor remaining after surgery , treatment may include the following : - Observation    .    - A second surgery to remove the tumor    .
- Radiation therapy , which may include conformal radiation therapy , intensity - modulated radiation therapy , proton beam radiation therapy , or stereotactic radiation therapy , when the tumor begins to grow again    .
- Combination chemotherapy with or without radiation therapy    .
In some cases , observation is used for children who have a visual pathway glioma    .
In other cases , treatment may include surgery to remove the tumor , radiation therapy , or chemotherapy    .
A goal of treatment is to save as much vision as possible    .
The effect of tumor growth on the child 's vision will be closely followed during treatment    .
Children with neurofibromatosis type 1 ( NF1 ) may not need treatment unless the tumor grows or signs or symptoms , such as vision problems , appear    .
When the tumor grows or signs or symptoms appear , treatment may include surgery to remove the tumor , radiation therapy , and / or chemotherapy    .
Children with tuberous sclerosis may develop benign ( not cancer ) tumors in the brain called subependymal giant cell astrocytomas ( SEGAs )    .
Targeted therapy with everolimus or sirolimus may be used instead of surgery , to shrink the tumors    .

Recurrent Childhood Low - Grade Astrocytomas
When low - grade astrocytoma recurs after treatment , it usually comes back where the tumor first formed    .
Before more cancer treatment is given , imaging tests , biopsy , or surgery are done to find out if there is cancer and how much there is    .
Treatment of recurrent childhood low - grade astrocytoma may include the following : - A second surgery to remove the tumor , if surgery was the only treatment given when the tumor was first diagnosed    .
- Radiation therapy to the tumor only , if radiation therapy was not used when the tumor was first diagnosed    .
Conformal radiation therapy may be given    .
- Chemotherapy , if the tumor recurred where it cannot be removed by surgery or the patient had radiation therapy when the tumor was first diagnosed    .
- Targeted therapy with a monoclonal antibody ( bevacizumab ) with or without chemotherapy    .    - A clinical trial of targeted therapy with a BRAF inhibitor ( dabrafenib ) , an mTOR inhibitor ( everolimus ) , or a MEK inhibitor ( selumetinib )    .    - A clinical trial of lenalidomide    .
Check the list of NCI - supported cancer clinical trials that are now accepting patients with recurrent childhood astrocytoma or other tumor of glial origin    .

What is (are) Childhood Central Nervous System Atypical Teratoid/Rhabdoid Tumor ?
Key Points
- Central nervous system atypical teratoid / rhabdoid tumor is a disease in which malignant ( cancer ) cells form in the tissues of the brain    .
- Certain genetic changes may increase the risk of atypical teratoid / rhabdoid tumor    .    - The signs and symptoms of atypical teratoid / rhabdoid tumor are not the same in every patient    .
- Tests that examine the brain and spinal cord are used to detect ( find ) CNS atypical teratoid / rhabdoid tumor    .
- Childhood atypical teratoid / rhabdoid tumor is diagnosed and may be removed in surgery    .
- Certain factors affect prognosis ( chance of recovery ) and treatment options    .
Central nervous system atypical teratoid / rhabdoid tumor is a disease in which malignant ( cancer ) cells form in the tissues of the brain    .
Central nervous system ( CNS ) atypical teratoid / rhabdoid tumor ( AT / RT ) is a very rare , fast - growing tumor of the brain and spinal cord    .
It usually occurs in children aged three years and younger , although it can occur in older children and adults    .
About half of these tumors form in the cerebellum or brain stem    .
The cerebellum is the part of the brain that controls movement , balance , and posture    .
The brain stem controls breathing , heart rate , and the nerves and muscles used in seeing , hearing , walking , talking , and eating    .
AT / RT may also be found in other parts of the central nervous system ( brain and spinal cord )    .
This summary describes the treatment of primary brain tumors ( tumors that begin in the brain )    .
Treatment for metastatic brain tumors , which are tumors formed by cancer cells that begin in other parts of the body and spread to the brain , is not covered in this summary    .
For more information , see the PDQ summary on Childhood Brain and Spinal Cord Tumors Treatment Overview about the different types of childhood brain and spinal cord tumors    .
Brain tumors can occur in both children and adults ; however , treatment for children may be different than treatment for adults    .
See the PDQ treatment summary on Adult Central Nervous System Tumors Treatment for more information    .
Who is at risk for Childhood Central Nervous System Atypical Teratoid/Rhabdoid Tumor? ?
Certain genetic changes may increase the risk of atypical teratoid / rhabdoid tumor    .
Anything that increases the risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor    .
Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer ; not having risk factors doesnt mean that you will not get cancer    .
Talk with your child 's doctor if you think your child may be at risk    .
Atypical teratoid / rhabdoid tumor may be linked to changes in the tumor suppressor genes SMARCB1 or SMARCA4    .
Genes of this type make a protein that helps control cell growth    .
Changes in the DNA of tumor suppressor genes like SMARCB1 or SMARCA4 may lead to cancer    .
Changes in the SMARCB1 or SMARCA4 genes may be inherited ( passed on from parents to offspring )    .
When this gene change is inherited , tumors may form in two parts of the body at the same time ( for example , in the brain and the kidney )    .
For patients with AT / RT , genetic counseling ( a discussion with a trained professional about inherited diseases and a possible need for gene testing ) may be recommended    .
What are the symptoms of Childhood Central Nervous System Atypical Teratoid/Rhabdoid Tumor ?
The signs and symptoms of atypical teratoid / rhabdoid tumor are not the same in every patient    .
Signs and symptoms depend on the following : - The child 's age    .
- Where the tumor has formed    .
Because atypical teratoid / rhabdoid tumor is fast growing , signs and symptoms may develop quickly and get worse over a period of days or weeks    .
Signs and symptoms may be caused by AT / RT or by other conditions    .
Check with your child 's doctor if your child has any of the following : - Morning headache or headache that goes away after vomiting    .
- Nausea and vomiting    .
- Unusual sleepiness or change in activity level    .
- Loss of balance , lack of coordination , or trouble walking    .
- Increase in head size ( in infants )    .
How to diagnose Childhood Central Nervous System Atypical Teratoid/Rhabdoid Tumor ?
Tests that examine the brain and spinal cord are used to detect ( find ) CNS atypical teratoid / rhabdoid tumor    .
The following tests and procedures may be used : - Physical exam and history :
An exam of the body to check general signs of health , including checking for signs of disease , such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual    .
A history of the patient 's health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken    .
- Neurological exam :
A series of questions and tests to check the brain , spinal cord , and nerve function    .
The exam checks a persons mental status , coordination , and ability to walk normally , and how well the muscles , senses , and reflexes work    .
This may also be called a neuro exam or a neurologic exam    .
- MRI ( magnetic resonance imaging ) : A procedure that uses a magnet , radio waves , and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the brain and spinal cord    .
This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging ( NMRI )    .
- Lumbar puncture : A procedure used to collect cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) from the spinal column    .
This is done by placing a needle between two bones in the spine and into the CSF around the spinal cord and removing a sample of fluid    .
The sample of CSF is checked under a microscope for signs of tumor cells    .
The sample may also be checked for the amounts of protein and glucose    .
A higher than normal amount of protein or lower than normal amount of glucose may be a sign of a tumor    .
This procedure is also called an LP or spinal tap    .
- SMARCB1 and SMARCA4 gene testing : A laboratory test in which a sample of blood or tissue is tested for the SMARCB1 and SMARCA4 genes    .
Childhood atypical teratoid / rhabdoid tumor is diagnosed and may be removed in surgery    .
If doctors think there might be a brain tumor , a biopsy may be done to remove a sample of tissue    .
For tumors in the brain , the biopsy is done by removing part of the skull and using a needle to remove a sample of tissue    .
A pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells    .
If cancer cells are found , the doctor may remove as much tumor as safely possible during the same surgery    .
The pathologist checks the cancer cells to find out the type of brain tumor    .
The following test may be done on the sample of tissue that is removed : - Immunohistochemistry :
A test that uses antibodies to check for certain antigens in a sample of tissue    .
The antibody is usually linked to a radioactive substance or a dye that causes the tissue to light up under a microscope    .
This test is used to tell the difference between AT / RT and other brain tumors    .
What is the outlook for Childhood Central Nervous System Atypical Teratoid/Rhabdoid Tumor ?
Certain factors affect prognosis ( chance of recovery ) and treatment options    .
The prognosis ( chance of recovery ) and treatment options depend on the following : - Whether there are certain inherited gene changes    .
- The age of the child    .
- The amount of tumor remaining after surgery    .
- Whether the cancer has spread to other parts of the central nervous system ( brain and spinal cord ) or to the kidney at the time of diagnosis    .
What are the stages of Childhood Central Nervous System Atypical Teratoid/Rhabdoid Tumor ?
Key Points
- There is no standard staging system for central nervous system atypical teratoid / rhabdoid tumor    .
There is no standard staging system for central nervous system atypical teratoid / rhabdoid tumor    .
The extent or spread of cancer is usually described as stages    .
There is no standard staging system for central nervous system atypical teratoid / rhabdoid tumor    .
For treatment , this tumor is grouped as newly diagnosed or recurrent    .
Treatment depends on the following : - The age of the child    .
- How much cancer remains after surgery to remove the tumor    .
Results from the following procedure are also used to plan treatment : - Ultrasound exam :
A procedure in which high - energy sound waves ( ultrasound ) are bounced off internal tissues or organs , such as the kidney , and make echoes    .
The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram    .
The picture can be printed to be looked at later    .
This procedure is done to check for tumors that may also have formed in the kidney    .
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Childhood Central Nervous System Atypical Teratoid/Rhabdoid Tumor ?
New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials    .
This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials    .
It may not mention every new treatment being studied    .
Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website    .
Targeted therapy Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to attack specific cancer cells    .
Targeted therapies usually cause less harm to normal cells than chemotherapy or radiation therapy do    .
Targeted therapy is being studied in the treatment of recurrent childhood central nervous system atypical teratoid / rhabdoid tumor    .
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
For some patients , taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice    .
Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process    .
Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment    .
Many of today 's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials    .
Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment    .
Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future    .
Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments , they often answer important questions and help move research forward    .
Patients can enter clinical trials before , during , or after starting their cancer treatment    .
Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment    .
Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better    .
There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring ( coming back ) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment    .
Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country    .

Treatment for AT / RT is usually within a clinical trial    .
A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer    .
Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country    .
Information about ongoing clinical trials is available from the NCI website    .
Choosing the most appropriate cancer treatment is a decision that ideally involves the patient , family , and health care team    .
Children with atypical teratoid / rhabdoid tumor should have their treatment planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating cancer in children    .
Treatment will be overseen by a pediatric oncologist , a doctor who specializes in treating children with cancer    .
The pediatric oncologist works with other pediatric health care providers who are experts in treating children with central nervous system cancer and who specialize in certain areas of medicine    .
- Pediatric nurse specialist    .
- Rehabilitation specialist    .
- Psychologist    .    - Social worker    .
- Geneticist or genetic counselor    .
Childhood brain tumors may cause signs or symptoms that begin before the cancer is diagnosed and continue for months or years    .
Signs or symptoms caused by the tumor may begin before diagnosis    .
These signs or symptoms may continue for months or years    .
It is important to talk with your child 's doctors about signs or symptoms caused by the tumor that may continue after treatment    .
Some cancer treatments cause side effects months or years after treatment has ended    .
Side effects from cancer treatment that begin during or after treatment and continue for months or years are called late effects    .
Late effects of cancer treatment may include the following : - Physical problems    .
- Changes in mood , feelings , thinking , learning , or memory    .
- Second cancers ( new types of cancer )    .
Some late effects may be treated or controlled    .
It is important to talk with your child 's doctors about the effects cancer treatment can have on your child    .
( See the PDQ summary on Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer for more information )    .
Four types of treatment are used :
Surgery Surgery is used to diagnose and treat CNS atypical teratoid / rhabdoid tumor    .
See the General Information section of this summary    .
Even if the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery , most patients will be given chemotherapy and possibly radiation therapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left    .
Treatment given after the surgery , to lower the risk that the cancer will come back , is called adjuvant therapy    .
Chemotherapy Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells , either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing    .
- When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid , an organ , or a body cavity such as the abdomen , the drugs mainly affect tumor cells in those areas ( regional chemotherapy )    .
Regular doses of anticancer drugs given by mouth or vein to treat brain and spinal cord tumors cannot cross the blood - brain barrier and reach the tumor    .
Anticancer drugs injected into the cerebrospinal fluid are able to reach the tumor    .
This is called intrathecal chemotherapy    .
- When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle , the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach tumor cells throughout the body ( systemic chemotherapy )    .
High doses of some anticancer drugs given into a vein can cross the blood - brain barrier and reach the tumor    .
Radiation therapy Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high - energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing    .
There are two types of radiation therapy : - External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer    .
- Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles , seeds , wires , or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer    .
The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type of tumor being treated and whether it has spread    .
External radiation therapy may be given to the brain and spinal cord    .
Because radiation therapy can affect growth and brain development in young children , especially children who are three years old or younger , the dose of radiation therapy may be lower than in older children    .
High - dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant High - dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant is a method of giving high doses of chemotherapy and replacing blood - forming cells destroyed by the cancer treatment    .
Stem cells ( immature blood cells ) are removed from the blood or bone marrow of the patient or a donor and are frozen and stored    .
After the chemotherapy is completed , the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion    .
These reinfused stem cells grow into ( and restore ) the bodys blood cells    .
New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials    .
This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials    .
It may not mention every new treatment being studied    .
Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website    .
Targeted therapy Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to attack specific cancer cells    .
Targeted therapies usually cause less harm to normal cells than chemotherapy or radiation therapy do    .
Targeted therapy is being studied in the treatment of recurrent childhood central nervous system atypical teratoid / rhabdoid tumor    .

Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country    .
See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials    .
These have been retrieved from NCI 's listing of clinical trials    .
Follow - up tests may be needed    .
Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer may be repeated    .
Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working    .
Decisions about whether to continue , change , or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests    .
Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended    .
The results of these tests can show if your child 's condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred ( come back )    .
These tests are sometimes called follow - up tests or check - ups    .
Key Points
- There is no standard treatment for patients with central nervous system atypical teratoid / rhabdoid tumor    .
- Combinations of treatments are used for patients with atypical teratoid / rhabdoid tumor    .
There is no standard treatment for patients with central nervous system atypical teratoid / rhabdoid tumor    .
Combinations of treatments are used for patients with atypical teratoid / rhabdoid tumor    .
Because atypical teratoid / rhabdoid tumor ( AT / RT ) is fast - growing , a combination of treatments is usually given    .
After surgery to remove the tumor , treatments for AT / RT may include combinations of the following : - Chemotherapy    .
- Radiation therapy    .    - High - dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant    .
Clinical trials of new treatments should be considered for patients with newly diagnosed atypical teratoid / rhabdoid tumor    .
What is (are) Childhood Brain Stem Glioma ?
Key Points
- Childhood brain stem glioma is a disease in which benign ( noncancer ) or malignant ( cancer ) cells form in the tissues of the brain stem    .
- Brain tumors may be benign ( not cancer ) or malignant ( cancer )    .    - There are two types of brain stem gliomas in children    .

- Certain factors affect prognosis ( chance of recovery ) and treatment options    .
Childhood brain stem glioma is a disease in which benign ( noncancer ) or malignant ( cancer ) cells form in the tissues of the brain stem    .
Gliomas are tumors formed from glial cells    .
Glial cells in the brain hold nerve cells in place , bring food and oxygen to them , and help protect them from disease , such as infection    .
The brain stem is the part of the brain connected to the spinal cord    .
It is in the lowest part of the brain , just above the back of the neck    .
The brain stem is the part of the brain that controls breathing , heart rate , and the nerves and muscles used in seeing , hearing , walking , talking , and eating    .
Most childhood brain stem gliomas are pontine gliomas , which form in a part of the brain stem called the pons    .
Brain tumors are the third most common type of cancer in children    .
This summary refers to the treatment of primary brain tumors ( tumors that begin in the brain )    .
Treatment for metastatic brain tumors , which are tumors formed by cancer cells that begin in other parts of the body and spread to the brain , is not discussed in this summary    .
Brain tumors can occur in both children and adults ; however , treatment for children may be different than treatment for adults    .
See the following PDQ treatment summaries for more information : - Childhood Brain and Spinal Cord Tumors Treatment Overview - Adult Central Nervous System Tumors Treatment
Brain tumors may be benign ( not cancer ) or malignant ( cancer )    .
Benign brain tumors grow and press on nearby areas of the brain    .
They rarely spread into other tissues    .
Malignant brain tumors are likely to grow quickly and spread into other brain tissue    .
When a tumor grows into or presses on an area of the brain , it may stop that part of the brain from working the way it should    .
Both benign and malignant brain tumors can cause signs and symptoms and need treatment    .
There are two types of brain stem gliomas in children    .
Childhood brain stem glioma is either a diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma ( DIPG ) or a focal glioma    .
- DIPG is a high - grade tumor that is fast - growing and spreads all through the brain stem    .
It is hard to treat and has a poor prognosis ( chance of recovery )    .
Children younger than 3 years diagnosed with DIPG may have a better prognosis than children who are 3 years and older    .
- A focal glioma is slow - growing and is in one area of the brain stem    .
It is easier to treat than DIPG and has a better prognosis    .
What causes Childhood Brain Stem Glioma ?
The cause of most childhood brain tumors is unknown    .
Who is at risk for Childhood Brain Stem Glioma? ?
Anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor    .
Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer ; not having risk factors doesnt mean that you will not get cancer    .
Talk with your child 's doctor if you think your child may be at risk    .
Possible risk factors for brain stem glioma include : - Having certain genetic disorders , such as neurofibromatosis type 1 ( NF1 )    .
What are the symptoms of Childhood Brain Stem Glioma ?
The signs and symptoms of brain stem glioma are not the same in every child    .
Signs and symptoms depend on the following : - Where the tumor forms in the brain    .
- The size of the tumor and whether it has spread all through the brain stem    .
- How fast the tumor grows    .
- The child 's age and development    .
Some tumors do not cause signs or symptoms    .
Signs and symptoms may be caused by childhood brain stem gliomas or by other conditions    .
Check with your child 's doctor if your child has any of the following : - Loss of ability to move one side of the face and / or body    .
- Loss of balance and trouble walking    .
- Vision and hearing problems    .
- Morning headache or headache that goes away after vomiting    .
- Nausea and vomiting    .
- Unusual sleepiness    .    - More or less energy than usual    .
- Changes in behavior    .
- Trouble learning in school    .
How to diagnose Childhood Brain Stem Glioma ?
Tests that examine the brain are used to detect ( find ) childhood brain stem glioma    .
The following tests and procedures may be used : - Physical exam and history :
An exam of the body to check general signs of health , including checking for signs of disease , such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual    .
A history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken    .
- Neurological exam :
A series of questions and tests to check the brain , spinal cord , and nerve function    .
The exam checks a persons mental status , coordination , and ability to walk normally , and how well the muscles , senses , and reflexes work    .
This may also be called a neuro exam or a neurologic exam    .
- MRI ( magnetic resonance imaging ) with gadolinium :
A procedure that uses a magnet , radio waves , and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the brain    .
A substance called gadolinium is injected into a vein    .
The gadolinium collects around the cancer cells so they show up brighter in the picture    .
This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging ( NMRI )    .
- A biopsy may be done to diagnose certain types of brain stem glioma    .
If the MRI scan looks like the tumor is a DIPG , a biopsy is usually not done and the tumor is not removed    .
If the MRI scan looks like a focal brain stem glioma , a biopsy may be done    .
A part of the skull is removed and a needle is used to remove a sample of the brain tissue    .
Sometimes , the needle is guided by a computer    .
A pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells    .
If cancer cells are found , the doctor will remove as much tumor as safely possible during the same surgery    .
The following test may be done on the tissue that was removed : - Immunohistochemistry :
A test that uses antibodies to check for certain antigens in a sample of tissue    .
The antibody is usually linked to a radioactive substance or a dye that causes the tissue to light up under a microscope    .
This type of test may be used to tell the difference between brain stem glioma and other brain tumors    .
What is the outlook for Childhood Brain Stem Glioma ?
Certain factors affect prognosis ( chance of recovery ) and treatment options    .
The prognosis and treatment options depend on : - The type of brain stem glioma    .    - Where the tumor is found in the brain and if it has spread within the brain stem    .
- The age of the child when diagnosed    .
- Whether or not the child has a condition called neurofibromatosis type 1    .    - Whether the tumor has just been diagnosed or has recurred ( come back )    .
What are the stages of Childhood Brain Stem Glioma ?
Key Points
- The plan for cancer treatment depends on whether the tumor is in one area of the brain or has spread all through the brain    .
The plan for cancer treatment depends on whether the tumor is in one area of the brain or has spread all through the brain    .
Staging is the process used to find out how much cancer there is and if cancer has spread    .
It is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment    .
There is no standard staging system for childhood brain stem glioma    .
Treatment is based on the following : - Whether the tumor is newly diagnosed or recurrent ( has come back after treatment )    .
- The type of tumor ( either a diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma or a focal glioma )    .

There are different types of treatment for children with brain stem glioma    .
Different types of treatment are available for children with brain stem glioma    .
Some treatments are standard ( the currently used treatment ) , and some are being tested in clinical trials    .
A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer    .
When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment , the new treatment may become the standard treatment    .
Because cancer in children is rare , taking part in a clinical trial should be considered    .
Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment    .
Children with brain stem glioma should have their treatment planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating childhood brain tumors    .
Treatment will be overseen by a pediatric oncologist , a doctor who specializes in treating children with cancer    .
The pediatric oncologist works with other pediatric health care providers who are experts in treating children with brain tumors and who specialize in certain areas of medicine    .
These may include the following specialists : - Pediatrician    .    - Neurosurgeon    .    - Neuropathologist    .
- Radiation oncologist    .
- Neuro - oncologist    .
- Neurologist    .    - Rehabilitation specialist    .
- Neuroradiologist    .
- Endocrinologist    .    - Psychologist    .
Childhood brain stem gliomas may cause signs or symptoms that continue for months or years    .
Signs or symptoms caused by the tumor may begin before diagnosis    .
Signs or symptoms caused by treatment may begin during or right after treatment    .
Some cancer treatments cause side effects months or years after treatment has ended    .
These are called late effects    .
Late effects may include the following : - Physical problems    .
- Changes in mood , feelings , thinking , learning , or memory    .
- Second cancers ( new types of cancer )    .
Some late effects may be treated or controlled    .
It is important to talk with your child 's doctors about the effects cancer treatment can have on your child    .
( See the PDQ summary on Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer for more information )    .
Six types of standard treatment are used :
Surgery Surgery may be used to diagnose and treat childhood brain stem glioma as discussed in the General Information section of this summary    .
Radiation therapy Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high - energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing    .
There are two types of radiation therapy : - External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer    .
- Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles , seeds , wires , or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer    .
The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type of the cancer being treated    .
External radiation therapy is used to treat DIPG    .
External and / or internal radiation therapy may be used to treat focal brain stem gliomas    .
Several months after radiation therapy to the brain , imaging tests may show changes to the brain tissue    .
These changes may be caused by the radiation therapy or may mean the tumor is growing    .
It is important to be sure the tumor is growing before any more treatment is given    .
Chemotherapy Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells , either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing    .
When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle , the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body ( systemic chemotherapy )    .
When chemotherapy is placed directly in the cerebrospinal fluid , an organ , or a body cavity such as the abdomen , the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas ( regional chemotherapy )    .
The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type of the cancer being treated    .
Because radiation therapy to the brain can affect growth and brain development in young children , clinical trials are studying ways of using chemotherapy to delay or reduce the need for radiation therapy    .
Cerebrospinal fluid diversion Cerebrospinal fluid diversion is a method used to drain fluid that has built up in the brain    .
A shunt ( long , thin tube ) is placed in a ventricle ( fluid - filled space ) of the brain and threaded under the skin to another part of the body , usually the abdomen    .
The shunt carries extra fluid away from the brain so it may be absorbed elsewhere in the body    .
Observation Observation is closely monitoring a patients condition without giving any treatment until signs or symptoms appear or change    .
Targeted therapy Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells    .
Some focal brain stem gliomas that cannot be removed by surgery may be treated with BRAF kinase inhibitor therapy    .
BRAF kinase inhibitors block the BRAF protein    .
BRAF proteins help control cell growth and may be mutated ( changed ) in some types of brain stem glioma    .
Blocking mutated BRAF kinase proteins may help keep cancer cells from growing    .
New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials    .
Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website    .
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
For some patients , taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice    .

Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated    .
Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working    .
Decisions about whether to continue , change , or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests    .
Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended    .
The results of these tests can show if your child 's condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred ( come back )    .
These tests are sometimes called follow - up tests or check - ups    .
If the results of imaging tests done after treatment show a mass in the brain , a biopsy may be done to find out if it is made up of dead tumor cells or if new cancer cells are growing    .
In children who are expected to live a long time , regular MRIs may be done to see if the cancer has come back    .
Treatment Options for Childhood Brain Stem Glioma
Newly Diagnosed Childhood Brain Stem Glioma
Newly diagnosed childhood brain stem glioma is a tumor for which no treatment has been given    .
The child may have received drugs or treatment to relieve signs or symptoms caused by the tumor    .
Standard treatment of diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma ( DIPG ) may include the following : - Radiation therapy    .
- Chemotherapy ( in infants )    .
Standard treatment of focal glioma may include the following : - Surgery that may be followed by chemotherapy and / or radiation therapy    .
- Observation for small tumors that grow slowly    .
Cerebrospinal fluid diversion may be done when there is extra fluid in the brain    .
- Internal radiation therapy with radioactive seeds , with or without chemotherapy , when the tumor cannot be removed by surgery    .
- Targeted therapy with a BRAF kinase inhibitor , for certain tumors that cannot be removed by surgery    .
Treatment of brain stem glioma in children with neurofibromatosis type 1 may be observation    .
The tumors are slow - growing in these children and may not need specific treatment for years    .
Check the list of NCI - supported cancer clinical trials that are now accepting patients with untreated childhood brain stem glioma    .
For more specific results , refine the search by using other search features , such as the location of the trial , the type of treatment , or the name of the drug    .
Talk with your child 's doctor about clinical trials that may be right for your child    .
General information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website    .
Progressive or Recurrent Childhood Brain Stem Glioma
When cancer does not get better with treatment or comes back , palliative care is an important part of the child 's treatment plan    .
It includes physical , psychological , social , and spiritual support for the child and family    .
The goal of palliative care is to help control symptoms and give the child the best quality of life possible    .
Parents may not be sure about whether to continue treatment or what kind of treatment is best for their child    .
The healthcare team can give parents information to help them make these decisions    .
There is no standard treatment for progressive or recurrent diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma    .
The child may be treated in a clinical trial of a new treatment    .
Treatment of recurrent focal childhood brain stem glioma may include the following : - A second surgery to remove the tumor    .
- External radiation therapy    .
- Chemotherapy    .    - A clinical trial of a new treatment    .
Check the list of NCI - supported cancer clinical trials that are now accepting patients with recurrent childhood brain stem glioma    .
For more specific results , refine the search by using other search features , such as the location of the trial , the type of treatment , or the name of the drug    .

What is (are) Childhood Central Nervous System Embryonal Tumors ?
Key Points
- Central nervous system ( CNS ) embryonal tumors may begin in embryonic ( fetal ) cells that remain in the brain after birth    .
- There are different types of CNS embryonal tumors    .
- Pineoblastomas form in cells of the pineal gland    .
- Certain genetic conditions increase the risk of childhood CNS embryonal tumors    .
- Signs and symptoms of childhood CNS embryonal tumors or pineoblastomas depend on the child 's age and where the tumor is    .
- Tests that examine the brain and spinal cord are used to detect ( find ) childhood CNS embryonal tumors or pineoblastomas    .
- A biopsy may be done to be sure of the diagnosis of CNS embryonal tumor or pineoblastoma    .
- Certain factors affect prognosis ( chance of recovery ) and treatment options    .
Central nervous system ( CNS ) embryonal tumors may begin in embryonic ( fetal ) cells that remain in the brain after birth    .
Central nervous system ( CNS ) embryonal tumors form in embryonic cells that remain in the brain after birth    .
CNS embryonal tumors tend to spread through the cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) to other parts of the brain and spinal cord    .
The tumors may be malignant ( cancer ) or benign ( not cancer )    .
Most CNS embryonal tumors in children are malignant    .
Malignant brain tumors are likely to grow quickly and spread into other parts of the brain    .
When a tumor grows into or presses on an area of the brain , it may stop that part of the brain from working the way it should    .
Benign brain tumors grow and press on nearby areas of the brain    .
They rarely spread to other parts of the brain    .
Both benign and malignant brain tumors can cause signs or symptoms and need treatment    .
Although cancer is rare in children , brain tumors are the third most common type of childhood cancer , after leukemia and lymphoma    .
This summary is about the treatment of primary brain tumors ( tumors that begin in the brain )    .
The treatment of metastatic brain tumors , which begin in other parts of the body and spread to the brain , is not discussed in this summary    .
For information about the different types of brain and spinal cord tumors , see the PDQ summary on Childhood Brain and Spinal Cord Tumors Treatment Overview    .
Brain tumors occur in both children and adults    .
Treatment for adults may be different from treatment for children    .
See the PDQ summary on Adult Central Nervous System Tumors Treatment for more information on the treatment of adults    .
There are different types of CNS embryonal tumors    .
The different types of CNS embryonal tumors include : - Medulloblastomas
Most CNS embryonal tumors are medulloblastomas    .
Medulloblastomas are fast - growing tumors that form in brain cells in the cerebellum    .
The cerebellum is at the lower back part of the brain between the cerebrum and the brain stem    .
The cerebellum controls movement , balance , and posture    .
Medulloblastomas sometimes spread to the bone , bone marrow , lung , or other parts of the body , but this is rare    .
- Nonmedulloblastoma embryonal tumors Nonmedulloblastoma embryonal tumors are fast - growing tumors that usually form in brain cells in the cerebrum    .
The cerebrum is at the top of the head and is the largest part of the brain    .
The cerebrum controls thinking , learning , problem - solving , emotions , speech , reading , writing , and voluntary movement    .
Nonmedulloblastoma embryonal tumors may also form in the brain stem or spinal cord    .
There are four types of nonmedulloblastoma embryonal tumors : - Embryonal tumors with multilayered rosettes Embryonal tumors with multilayered rosettes ( ETMR ) are rare tumors that form in the brain and spinal cord    .
ETMR most commonly occur in young children and are fast - growing tumors    .
- Medulloepitheliomas Medulloepitheliomas are fast - growing tumors that usually form in the brain , spinal cord or nerves just outside the spinal column    .
They occur most often in infants and young children    .
- CNS neuroblastomas CNS neuroblastomas are a very rare type of neuroblastoma that form in the nerve tissue of the cerebrum or the layers of tissue that cover the brain and spinal cord    .
CNS neuroblastomas may be large and spread to other parts of the brain or spinal cord    .
- CNS ganglioneuroblastomas CNS ganglioneuroblastomas are rare tumors that form in nerve tissue of the brain and spinal cord    .
They may form in one area and be fast growing or form in more than one area and be slow growing    .
Childhood CNS atypical teratoid / rhabdoid tumor is also a type of embryonal tumor , but it is treated differently than other childhood CNS embryonal tumors    .
See the PDQ summary on Childhood Central Nervous System Atypical Teratoid / Rhabdoid Tumor Treatment for more information    .
Pineoblastomas form in cells of the pineal gland    .
The pineal gland is a tiny organ in the center of the brain    .
The gland makes melatonin , a substance that helps control our sleep cycle    .
Pineoblastomas form in cells of the pineal gland and are usually malignant    .
Pineoblastomas are fast - growing tumors with cells that look very different from normal pineal gland cells    .
Pineoblastomas are not a type of CNS embryonal tumor but treatment for them is a lot like treatment for CNS embryonal tumors    .
Pineoblastoma is linked with inherited changes in the retinoblastoma ( RB1 ) gene    .
A child with the inherited form of retinoblastoma ( cancer than forms in the tissues of the retina ) has an increased risk of pineoblastoma    .
When retinoblastoma forms at the same time as a tumor in or near the pineal gland , it is called trilateral retinoblastoma    .
MRI ( magnetic resonance imaging ) testing in children with retinoblastoma may detect pineoblastoma at an early stage when it can be treated successfully    .
Who is at risk for Childhood Central Nervous System Embryonal Tumors? ?
Certain genetic conditions increase the risk of childhood CNS embryonal tumors    .
Anything that increases the risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor    .
Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer ; not having risk factors doesnt mean that you will not get cancer    .
Talk with your childs doctor if you think your child may be at risk    .
Risk factors for CNS embryonal tumors include having the following inherited diseases : - Turcot syndrome    .
- Rubinstein - Taybi syndrome    .    - Nevoid basal cell carcinoma ( Gorlin ) syndrome    .
- Li-Fraumeni syndrome    .    - Fanconi anemia    .
In most cases , the cause of CNS embryonal tumors is not known    .
What are the symptoms of Childhood Central Nervous System Embryonal Tumors ?
Signs and symptoms of childhood CNS embryonal tumors or pineoblastomas depend on the child 's age and where the tumor is    .
These and other signs and symptoms may be caused by childhood CNS embryonal tumors , pineoblastomas , or other conditions    .
Check with your child 's doctor if your child has any of the following : - Loss of balance , trouble walking , worsening handwriting , or slow speech    .
- Lack of coordination    .
- Headache , especially in the morning , or headache that goes away after vomiting    .
- Double vision or other eye problems    .
- Nausea and vomiting    .
- General weakness or weakness on one side of the face    .
- Unusual sleepiness or change in energy level    .
- Seizures    .
Infants and young children with these tumors may be irritable or grow slowly    .
Also they may not eat well or meet developmental milestones such as sitting , walking , and talking in sentences    .
How to diagnose Childhood Central Nervous System Embryonal Tumors ?
Tests that examine the brain and spinal cord are used to detect ( find ) childhood CNS embryonal tumors or pineoblastomas    .
The following tests and procedures may be used : - Physical exam and history :
An exam of the body to check general signs of health , including checking for signs of disease , such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual    .
A history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken    .
- Neurological exam :
A series of questions and tests to check the brain , spinal cord , and nerve function    .
The exam checks a patient 's mental status , coordination , and ability to walk normally , and how well the muscles , senses , and reflexes work    .
This may also be called a neuro exam or a neurologic exam    .
- MRI ( magnetic resonance imaging ) of the brain and spinal cord with gadolinium :
A procedure that uses a magnet , radio waves , and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the brain and spinal cord    .
A substance called gadolinium is injected into a vein    .
The gadolinium collects around the cancer cells so they show up brighter in the picture    .
This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging ( NMRI )    .
Sometimes magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( MRS ) is done during the MRI scan to look at the chemicals in brain tissue    .
- Lumbar puncture : A procedure used to collect cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) from the spinal column    .
This is done by placing a needle between two bones in the spine and into the CSF around the spinal cord and removing a sample of the fluid    .
The sample of CSF is checked under a microscope for signs of tumor cells    .
The sample may also be checked for the amounts of protein and glucose    .
A higher than normal amount of protein or lower than normal amount of glucose may be a sign of a tumor    .
This procedure is also called an LP or spinal tap    .
A biopsy may be done to be sure of the diagnosis of CNS embryonal tumor or pineoblastoma    .
If doctors think your child may have a CNS embryonal tumor or pineoblastoma , a biopsy may be done    .
For brain tumors , the biopsy is done by removing part of the skull and using a needle to remove a sample of tissue    .
Sometimes , a computer - guided needle is used to remove the tissue sample    .
A pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells    .
If cancer cells are found , the doctor may remove as much tumor as safely possible during the same surgery    .
The piece of skull is usually put back in place after the procedure    .
The following test may be done on the sample of tissue that is removed : - Immunohistochemistry :
A test that uses antibodies to check for certain antigens in a sample of tissue    .
The antibody is usually linked to a radioactive substance or a dye that causes the tissue to light up under a microscope    .
This type of test may be used to tell the difference between different types of brain tumors    .
What is the outlook for Childhood Central Nervous System Embryonal Tumors ?
Certain factors affect prognosis ( chance of recovery ) and treatment options    .
The prognosis ( chance of recovery ) and treatment options depend on : - The type of tumor and where it is in the brain    .
- Whether the cancer has spread within the brain and spinal cord when the tumor is found    .
- The age of the child when the tumor is found    .
- How much of the tumor remains after surgery    .
- Whether there are certain changes in the chromosomes , genes , or brain cells    .
- Whether the tumor has just been diagnosed or has recurred ( come back )    .
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Childhood Central Nervous System Embryonal Tumors ?
New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials    .
Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website    .
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
For some patients , taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice    .
Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process    .
Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment    .
Many of today 's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials    .
Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment    .
Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future    .
Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments , they often answer important questions and help move research forward    .
Patients can enter clinical trials before , during , or after starting their cancer treatment    .
Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment    .
Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better    .
There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring ( coming back ) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment    .
Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country    .
See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials    .
These have been retrieved from NCI 's listing of clinical trials    .
What are the treatments for Childhood Central Nervous System Embryonal Tumors ?
Key Points
- There are different types of treatment for children who have central nervous system ( CNS ) embryonal tumors    .
- Children who have CNS embryonal tumors should have their treatment planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating brain tumors in children    .
- Childhood brain tumors may cause signs or symptoms that begin before the cancer is diagnosed and continue for months or years    .
- Some cancer treatments cause side effects months or years after treatment has ended    .
- Five types of treatment are used : - Surgery - Radiation therapy - Chemotherapy - High - dose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue - Targeted therapy - New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials    .
- Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
- Patients can enter clinical trials before , during , or after starting their cancer treatment    .
- Follow - up tests may be needed    .
There are different types of treatment for children who have central nervous system ( CNS ) embryonal tumors    .
Different types of treatment are available for children with central nervous system ( CNS ) embryonal tumors    .
Some treatments are standard ( the currently used treatment ) , and some are being tested in clinical trials    .
A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer    .
When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment , the new treatment may become the standard treatment    .
Because cancer in children is rare , taking part in a clinical trial should be considered    .
Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment    .
Children who have CNS embryonal tumors should have their treatment planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating brain tumors in children    .
Treatment will be overseen by a pediatric oncologist , a doctor who specializes in treating children with cancer    .
The pediatric oncologist works with other pediatric health care providers who are experts in treating children with brain tumors and who specialize in certain areas of medicine    .
These may include the following specialists : - Pediatrician    .    - Neurosurgeon    .    - Neurologist    .    - Neuropathologist    .
- Neuroradiologist    .
- Rehabilitation specialist    .
- Radiation oncologist    .    - Psychologist    .
Childhood brain tumors may cause signs or symptoms that begin before the cancer is diagnosed and continue for months or years    .
Signs or symptoms caused by the tumor may begin before the cancer is diagnosed and continue for months or years    .
It is important to talk with your child 's doctors about signs or symptoms caused by the tumor that may continue after treatment    .
Some cancer treatments cause side effects months or years after treatment has ended    .
Side effects from cancer treatment that begin during or after treatment and continue for months or years are called late effects    .
Late effects of cancer treatment may include the following : - Physical problems    .
- Changes in mood , feelings , thinking , learning , or memory    .
- Second cancers ( new types of cancer )    .
Children diagnosed with medulloblastoma may have certain problems after surgery or radiation therapy such as changes in the ability to think , learn , and pay attention    .
Also , cerebellar mutism syndrome may occur after surgery    .
Signs of this syndrome include the following : - Delayed ability to speak    .
- Trouble swallowing and eating    .
- Loss of balance , trouble walking , and worsening handwriting    .
- Loss of muscle tone    .
- Mood swings and changes in personality    .
Some late effects may be treated or controlled    .
It is important to talk with your child 's doctors about the effects cancer treatment can have on your child    .
( See the PDQ summary on Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer for more information )    .
Five types of treatment are used :
Surgery Surgery is used to diagnose and treat a childhood CNS embryonal tumor as described in the General Information section of this summary    .
Even if the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery , some patients may be given chemotherapy and / or radiation therapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left    .
Treatment given after the surgery , to lower the risk that the cancer will come back , is called adjuvant therapy    .
Radiation therapy Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high - energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing    .
There are two types of radiation therapy : - External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer    .
Certain ways of giving radiation therapy can help keep radiation from damaging nearby healthy tissue    .
These types of radiation therapy include the following : - Conformal radiation therapy : Conformal radiation therapy is a type of external radiation therapy that uses a computer to make a 3 - dimensional ( 3 - D ) picture of the tumor and shapes the radiation beams to fit the tumor    .
This allows a high dose of radiation to reach the tumor and causes less damage to nearby healthy tissue    .
- Stereotactic radiation therapy : Stereotactic radiation therapy is a type of external radiation therapy    .
A rigid head frame is attached to the skull to keep the head still during the radiation treatment    .
A machine aims radiation directly at the tumor , causing less damage to nearby healthy tissue    .
The total dose of radiation is divided into several smaller doses given over several days    .
This procedure is also called stereotactic external - beam radiation therapy and stereotaxic radiation therapy    .
- Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles , seeds , wires , or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer    .
Radiation therapy to the brain can affect growth and development in young children    .
For this reason , clinical trials are studying new ways of giving radiation that may have fewer side effects than standard methods    .
The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type of cancer being treated    .
External radiation therapy is used to treat childhood CNS embryonal tumors    .
Because radiation therapy can affect growth and brain development in young children , especially children who are three years old or younger , chemotherapy may be given to delay or reduce the need for radiation therapy    .
Chemotherapy Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells , either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing    .
When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle , the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body ( systemic chemotherapy )    .
When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid , an organ , or a body cavity such as the abdomen , the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas ( regional chemotherapy )    .
Combination chemotherapy is treatment using more than one anticancer drug    .
The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type of cancer being treated    .
Regular dose anticancer drugs given by mouth or vein to treat central nervous system tumors cannot cross the blood - brain barrier and enter the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord    .
Instead , an anticancer drug is injected into the fluid - filled space to kill cancer cells that may have spread there    .
This is called intrathecal or intraventricular chemotherapy    .
High - dose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue High - dose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue is a way of giving high doses of chemotherapy and replacing blood - forming cells destroyed by the cancer treatment    .
Stem cells ( immature blood cells ) are removed from the blood or bone marrow of the patient or a donor and are frozen and stored    .
After the chemotherapy is completed , the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion    .
These reinfused stem cells grow into ( and restore ) the bodys blood cells    .
Targeted therapy Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to attack cancer cells    .
Targeted therapies usually cause less harm to normal cells than chemotherapy or radiation therapy do    .
Signal transduction inhibitors are a type of targeted therapy used to treat recurrent medulloblastoma    .
Signal transduction inhibitors block signals that are passed from one molecule to another inside a cell    .
Blocking these signals may kill cancer cells    .
Vismodegib is a type of signal transduction inhibitor    .
New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials    .
Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website    .
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
For some patients , taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice    .

Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country    .
See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials    .
These have been retrieved from NCI 's listing of clinical trials    .
Follow - up tests may be needed    .
Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated    .
( See the General Information section for a list of tests    .    )
Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working    .
Decisions about whether to continue , change , or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests    .
This is sometimes called re-staging    .
Some of the imaging tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended    .
The results of these tests can show if your child 's condition has changed or if the brain tumor has recurred ( come back )    .
If the imaging tests show abnormal tissue in the brain , a biopsy may also be done to find out if the tissue is made up of dead tumor cells or if new cancer cells are growing    .
These tests are sometimes called follow - up tests or check - ups    .

Recurrent Childhood Central Nervous System Embryonal Tumors and Pineoblastomas
The treatment of central nervous system ( CNS ) embryonal tumors and pineoblastoma that recur ( come back ) depends on : - The type of tumor    .    - Whether the tumor recurred where it first formed or has spread to other parts of the brain , spinal cord , or body    .
- The type of treatment given in the past    .
- How much time has passed since the initial treatment ended    .
- Whether the patient has signs or symptoms    .
Treatment for recurrent childhood CNS embryonal tumors and pineoblastomas may include the following : - For children who previously received radiation therapy and chemotherapy , treatment may include repeat radiation at the site where the cancer started and where the tumor has spread    .
Stereotactic radiation therapy and / or chemotherapy may also be used    .
- For infants and young children who previously received chemotherapy only and have a local recurrence , treatment may be chemotherapy with radiation therapy to the tumor and the area close to it    .
Surgery to remove the tumor may also be done    .
- For patients who previously received radiation therapy , high - dose chemotherapy and stem cell rescue may be used    .
It is not known whether this treatment improves survival    .

Childhood central nervous system ( CNS ) germ cell tumors form from germ cells    .
Germ cells are a type of cell that form as a fetus ( unborn baby ) develops    .
These cells later become sperm in the testicles or eggs in the ovaries    .
Sometimes while the fetus is forming , germ cells travel to other parts of the body and grow into germ cell tumors    .
Germ cells tumors that form in the brain or spinal cord are called CNS germ cell tumors    .
The most common places for one or more central nervous system ( CNS ) germ cell tumors to form is near the pineal gland and in an area of the brain that includes the pituitary gland and the tissue just above it    .
Sometimes germ cell tumors may form in other areas of the brain    .
This summary is about germ cell tumors that start in the central nervous system ( brain and spinal cord )    .
Germ cell tumors may also form in other parts of the body    .
See the PDQ summary on Childhood Extracranial Germ Cell Tumors Treatment for information on germ cell tumors that are extracranial ( outside the brain )    .
CNS germ cell tumors usually occur in children , but may occur in adults    .
Treatment for children may be different than treatment for adults    .
See the following PDQ summaries for information about treatment for adults : - Adult Central Nervous System Tumors Treatment - Extragonadal Germ Cell Tumors Treatment
For information about other types of childhood brain and spinal cord tumors , see the PDQ summary on Childhood Brain and Spinal Cord Tumors Treatment Overview    .
There are different types of childhood CNS germ cell tumors    .
There are different types of CNS germ cell tumors    .
The type of CNS germ cell tumor depends on what the cells look like under a microscope    .
This summary is about the treatment of the following types of CNS germ cell tumors : Germinomas Germinomas are the most common type of CNS germ cell tumor and have a good prognosis    .
Nongerminomas
Some nongerminomas make hormones    .
CNS teratomas are a type of nongerminoma that does not make hormones    .
They may have different kinds of tissue in them , such as hair , muscle , and bone    .
Teratomas are described as mature or immature , based on how normal the cells look under a microscope    .
Sometimes teratomas are a mix of mature and immature cells    .
Other types of nongerminomas include the following : - Choriocarcinomas make the hormone beta - human chorionic gonadotropin ( - hCG )    .
- Embryonal carcinomas do not make hormones    .
- Yolk sac tumors make the hormone alpha - fetoprotein ( AFP )    .
- Mixed germ cell tumors are made of more than one kind of germ cell    .
What are the stages of Childhood Central Nervous System Germ Cell Tumors ?
Key Points
- Childhood central nervous system ( CNS ) germ cell tumors rarely spread outside of the brain and spinal cord    .
Childhood central nervous system ( CNS ) germ cell tumors rarely spread outside of the brain and spinal cord    .
Staging is the process used to find out how much cancer there is and if cancer has spread    .
There is no standard staging system for childhood central nervous system ( CNS ) germ cell tumors    .
The treatment plan depends on the following : - The type of germ cell tumor    .
- Whether the tumor has spread within the CNS or to other parts of the body    .
- The results of tests and procedures done to diagnose childhood CNS germ cell tumors    .
- Whether the tumor is newly diagnosed or has recurred ( come back ) after treatment    .
What causes Childhood Central Nervous System Germ Cell Tumors ?
The cause of most childhood CNS germ cell tumors is not known    .
What are the symptoms of Childhood Central Nervous System Germ Cell Tumors ?
Signs and symptoms of childhood CNS germ cell tumors include unusual thirst , frequent urination , early puberty , or vision changes    .
Signs and symptoms depend on the following : - Where the tumor has formed    .
- The size of the tumor    .

How to diagnose Childhood Central Nervous System Germ Cell Tumors ?
Imaging studies and tests are used to detect ( find ) and diagnose childhood CNS germ cell tumors    .
An exam of the body to check general signs of health , including checking for signs of disease , such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual    .
A history of the patient 's health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken    .
- Neurological exam :
A series of questions and tests to check the brain , spinal cord , and nerve function    .
The exam checks a persons mental status , coordination , and ability to walk normally , and how well the muscles , senses , and reflexes work    .
This may also be called a neuro exam or a neurologic exam    .
- Visual field exam :
An exam to check a persons field of vision ( the total area in which objects can be seen )    .
This test measures both central vision ( how much a person can see when looking straight ahead ) and peripheral vision ( how much a person can see in all other directions while staring straight ahead )    .
The eyes are tested one at a time    .
The eye not being tested is covered    .
- MRI ( magnetic resonance imaging ) with gadolinium :
A procedure that uses a magnet , radio waves , and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the brain and spinal cord    .
A substance called gadolinium is injected into a vein    .
The gadolinium collects around the cancer cells so they show up brighter in the picture    .
This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging ( NMRI )    .
- Lumbar puncture : A procedure used to collect cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) from the spinal column    .
This is done by placing a needle between two bones in the spine and into the CSF around the spinal cord and removing a sample of the fluid    .
The sample of CSF is checked under a microscope for signs of tumor cells    .
The sample may also be checked for the amounts of protein and glucose    .
A higher than normal amount of protein or lower than normal amount of glucose may be a sign of a tumor    .
This procedure is also called an LP or spinal tap    .
- Tumor marker tests :
A procedure in which a sample of blood or cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood and CSF by organs , tissues , or tumor cells in the body    .
Certain substances are linked to specific types of cancer when found in increased levels in the blood    .
These are called tumor markers    .
The following tumor markers are used to diagnose some CNS germ cell tumors : - Alpha-fetoprotein ( AFP )    .
- Beta -human chorionic gonadotropin ( - hCG )    .    - Blood chemistry studies :
A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body    .
An unusual ( higher - or lower - than - normal ) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease    .
- Blood hormone studies : A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain hormones released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body    .
An unusual ( higher - or lower - than - normal ) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease in the organ or tissue that makes it    .
The blood will be checked for the levels of hormones made by the pituitary gland and other glands    .
A biopsy may be done to be sure of the diagnosis of CNS germ cell tumor    .
If doctors think your child may have a CNS germ cell tumor , a biopsy may be done    .
For brain tumors , the biopsy is done by removing part of the skull and using a needle to remove a sample of tissue    .
Sometimes , a needle guided by a computer is used to remove the tissue sample    .
A pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells    .
If cancer cells are found , the doctor may remove as much tumor as safely possible during the same surgery    .
The piece of skull is usually put back in place after the procedure    .
Sometimes the diagnosis can be made based on the results of imaging and tumor marker tests and a biopsy is not needed    .
The following test may be done on the sample of tissue that is removed : - Immunohistochemistry :
A test that uses antibodies to check for certain antigens in a sample of tissue    .
The antibody is usually linked to a radioactive substance or a dye that causes the tissue to light up under a microscope    .
This type of test may be used to tell the difference between different types of brain tumors    .
What is the outlook for Childhood Central Nervous System Germ Cell Tumors ?
Certain factors affect prognosis ( chance of recovery )    .
The prognosis ( chance of recovery ) depends on the following : - The type of germ cell tumor    .
- The type and level of any tumor markers    .
- Where the tumor is in the brain or in the spinal cord    .
- Whether the cancer has spread within the brain and spinal cord or to other parts of the body    .
- Whether the tumor is newly diagnosed or has recurred ( come back ) after treatment    .

Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website    .
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
For some patients , taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice    .
Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process    .
Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment    .
Many of today 's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials    .
Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment    .
Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future    .
Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments , they often answer important questions and help move research forward    .
Patients can enter clinical trials before , during , or after starting their cancer treatment    .
Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment    .
Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better    .
There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring ( coming back ) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment    .
Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country    .
See the Current Clinical Trials section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials    .
These have been retrieved from the NCI 's listing of clinical trials    .

There are different types of treatment for patients with childhood central nervous system ( CNS ) germ cell tumors    .
Different types of treatment are available for children with childhood central nervous system ( CNS ) germ cell tumors    .
Some treatments are standard ( the currently used treatment ) , and some are being tested in clinical trials    .
A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer    .
When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment , the new treatment may become the standard treatment    .
Because cancer in children is rare , taking part in a clinical trial should be considered    .
Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment    .
Children with childhood CNS germ cell tumors should have their treatment planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating cancer in children    .
Treatment will be overseen by a pediatric oncologist and / or a radiation oncologist ,    .
A pediatric oncologist is a doctor who specializes in treating children with cancer    .
A radiation oncologist specializes in treating cancer with radiation therapy    .
These doctors work with other pediatric health care providers who are experts in treating children with childhood CNS germ cell tumors and who specialize in certain areas of medicine    .
These may include the following specialists : - Pediatrician    .    - Pediatric neurosurgeon    .    - Neurologist    .    - Endocrinologist    .    - Ophthalmologist    .
- Pediatric nurse specialist    .
- Rehabilitation specialist    .
- Psychologist    .    - Social worker    .
Childhood CNS germ cell tumors may cause signs or symptoms that begin before the cancer is diagnosed and continue for months or years    .
Childhood CNS germ cell tumors may cause signs or symptoms that continue for months or years    .
Signs or symptoms caused by the tumor may begin before the cancer is diagnosed    .
Signs or symptoms caused by treatment may begin during or right after treatment    .
Some cancer treatments cause side effects months or years after treatment has ended    .
Some cancer treatments cause side effects that continue or appear months or years after cancer treatment has ended    .
These are called late effects    .
Late effects of cancer treatment may include : - Physical problems    .
- Changes in mood , feelings , thinking , learning , or memory    .
- Second cancers ( new types of cancer )    .
Some late effects may be treated or controlled    .
It is important to talk with your child 's doctors about the possible late effects caused by some treatments    .
( See the PDQ summary on Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer for more information )    .
Four types of treatment are used :
Radiation therapy Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high - energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing    .
There are two types of radiation therapy : - External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer    .
Certain ways of giving radiation therapy can help keep radiation from damaging nearby healthy tissue    .
This type of radiation therapy may include the following : - Stereotactic radiosurgery : Stereotactic radiosurgery is a type of external radiation therapy    .
A rigid head frame is attached to the skull to keep the head still during the radiation treatment    .
A machine aims a single large dose of radiation directly at the tumor    .
This procedure does not involve surgery    .
It is also called stereotaxic radiosurgery , radiosurgery , and radiation surgery    .
- Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles , seeds , wires , or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer    .
The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type of cancer being treated    .
External radiation therapy is used to treat childhood CNS germ cell tumors    .
Radiation therapy to the brain can affect growth and development in young children    .
Certain ways of giving radiation therapy can lessen the damage to healthy brain tissue    .
For children younger than 3 years , chemotherapy may be given instead    .
This can delay or reduce the need for radiation therapy    .
Chemotherapy Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells , either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing    .
When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle , the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body ( systemic chemotherapy )    .
When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid , an organ , or a body cavity such as the abdomen , the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas ( regional chemotherapy )    .
The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type of cancer being treated    .
Surgery
Whether surgery to remove the tumor can be done depends on where the tumor is in the brain    .
Surgery to remove the tumor may cause severe , long - term side effects    .
Surgery may be done to remove teratomas and may be used for germ cell tumors that come back    .
Even if the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery , some patients may be given chemotherapy or radiation therapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left    .
Treatment given after the surgery , to lower the risk that the cancer will come back , is called adjuvant therapy    .
High - dose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue High - dose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue is a way of giving high doses of chemotherapy and replacing blood - forming cells destroyed by the cancer treatment    .
Stem cells ( immature blood cells ) are removed from the blood or bone marrow of the patient or a donor and are frozen and stored    .
After the chemotherapy is completed , the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion    .
These reinfused stem cells grow into ( and restore ) the bodys blood cells    .
New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials    .
Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website    .
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
For some patients , taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice    .
Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process    .

Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country    .
See the Current Clinical Trials section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials    .
These have been retrieved from the NCI 's listing of clinical trials    .
Follow - up tests may be needed    .
Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated    .
Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working    .
Decisions about whether to continue , change , or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests    .
Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended    .
The results of these tests can show if your child 's condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred ( come back )    .
These tests are sometimes called follow - up tests or check - ups    .
Children whose cancer affected their pituitary gland when the cancer was diagnosed will usually need to have their blood hormone levels checked    .
If the blood hormone level is low , replacement hormone medicine is given    .
Children who had a high tumor marker level ( alpha - fetoprotein or beta - human chorionic gonadotropin ) when the cancer was diagnosed usually need to have their blood tumor marker level checked    .
If the tumor marker level increases after initial treatment , the tumor may have recurred    .
Treatment Options for Childhood CNS Germ Cell Tumors
Newly Diagnosed CNS Germinomas
Treatment of newly diagnosed central nervous system ( CNS ) germinomas may include the following : - Radiation therapy to the tumor and ventricles ( fluid - filled spaces ) of the brain    .
A higher dose of radiation is given to the tumor than the area around the tumor    .
- Chemotherapy followed by radiation therapy , for younger children    .    - A clinical trial of chemotherapy followed by radiation therapy given in lower doses depending on how the tumor responds to treatment    .
Newly Diagnosed CNS Teratomas
Treatment of newly diagnosed mature and immature central nervous system ( CNS ) teratomas may include the following : - Surgery to remove as much of the tumor as possible    .
Radiation therapy and / or chemotherapy may be given if any tumor remains after surgery    .
Newly Diagnosed CNS Nongerminomas
It is not clear what treatment is best for newly diagnosed central nervous system ( CNS ) nongerminomas is    .
Treatment of choriocarcinoma , embryonal carcinoma , yolk sac tumor , or mixed germ cell tumor may include the following : - Chemotherapy followed by radiation therapy    .
If a mass remains after chemotherapy , surgery may be needed to check if the mass is a mature teratoma , fibrosis , or a growing tumor    .
- If the mass is a mature teratoma or fibrosis , radiation therapy is given    .
- If the mass is a growing tumor , other treatments may be given    .
- Surgery to remove as much of the mass as possible and check for tumor cells , if tumor marker levels are normal and the mass continues to grow ( called growing teratoma syndrome )    .    - A clinical trial of chemotherapy followed by radiation therapy given in lower doses depending on how the tumor responds to treatment    .
Recurrent Childhood CNS Germ Cell Tumors
Treatment of recurrent childhood central nervous system ( CNS ) germ cell tumors may include the following : - Chemotherapy followed by radiation therapy    .
- High - dose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue using the patient 's stem cells    .

What is (are) Childhood Craniopharyngioma ?
Key Points
- Childhood craniopharyngiomas are benign brain tumors found near the pituitary gland    .
- There are no known risk factors for childhood craniopharyngioma    .
- Signs of childhood craniopharyngioma include vision changes and slow growth    .
- Tests that examine the brain , vision , and hormone levels are used to detect ( find ) childhood craniopharyngiomas    .
- Childhood craniopharyngiomas are diagnosed and may be removed in the same surgery    .
- Certain factors affect prognosis ( chance of recovery ) and treatment options    .
Childhood craniopharyngiomas are benign brain tumors found near the pituitary gland    .
Childhood craniopharyngiomas are rare tumors usually found near the pituitary gland ( a pea-sized organ at the bottom of the brain that controls other glands ) and the hypothalamus ( a small cone - shaped organ connected to the pituitary gland by nerves )    .
Craniopharyngiomas are usually part solid mass and part fluid - filled cyst    .
They are benign ( not cancer ) and do not spread to other parts of the brain or to other parts of the body    .
However , they may grow and press on nearby parts of the brain or other areas , including the pituitary gland , the optic chiasm , optic nerves , and fluid - filled spaces in the brain    .
Craniopharyngiomas may affect many functions of the brain    .
They may affect hormone making , growth , and vision    .
Benign brain tumors need treatment    .
This summary is about the treatment of primary brain tumors ( tumors that begin in the brain )    .
Treatment for metastatic brain tumors , which are tumors formed by cancer cells that begin in other parts of the body and spread to the brain , is not covered in this summary    .
See the PDQ treatment summary on Childhood Brain and Spinal Cord Tumors Treatment Overview for information about the different types of childhood brain and spinal cord tumors    .
Brain tumors can occur in both children and adults ; however , treatment for children may be different than treatment for adults    .
( See the PDQ summary on Adult Central Nervous System Tumors Treatment for more information    .    )
Who is at risk for Childhood Craniopharyngioma? ?
There are no known risk factors for childhood craniopharyngioma    .
Craniopharyngiomas are rare in children younger than 2 years of age and are most often diagnosed in children aged 5 to 14 years    .
It is not known what causes these tumors    .
What are the symptoms of Childhood Craniopharyngioma ?
Signs of childhood craniopharyngioma include vision changes and slow growth    .
These and other signs and symptoms may be caused by craniopharyngiomas or by other conditions    .
Check with your childs doctor if your child has any of the following : - Headaches , including morning headache or headache that goes away after vomiting    .
- Vision changes    .
- Nausea and vomiting    .
- Loss of balance or trouble walking    .
- Increase in thirst or urination    .
- Unusual sleepiness or change in energy level    .
- Changes in personality or behavior    .
- Short stature or slow growth    .
- Hearing loss    .    - Weight gain    .
How to diagnose Childhood Craniopharyngioma ?
Tests that examine the brain , vision , and hormone levels are used to detect ( find ) childhood craniopharyngiomas    .
An exam of the body to check general signs of health , including checking for signs of disease , such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual    .
A history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken    .
- Neurological exam :
A series of questions and tests to check the brain , spinal cord , and nerve function    .
The exam checks a persons mental status , coordination , and ability to walk normally , and how well the muscles , senses , and reflexes work    .
This may also be called a neuro exam or a neurologic exam    .
- Visual field exam :
An exam to check a persons field of vision ( the total area in which objects can be seen )    .
This test measures both central vision ( how much a person can see when looking straight ahead ) and peripheral vision ( how much a person can see in all other directions while staring straight ahead )    .
Any loss of vision may be a sign of a tumor that has damaged or pressed on the parts of the brain that affect eyesight    .
- CT scan ( CAT scan ) : A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body , taken from different angles    .
The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine    .
A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly    .
This procedure is also called computed tomography , computerized tomography , or computerized axial tomography    .
- MRI ( magnetic resonance imaging ) of the brain and spinal cord with gadolinium :
A procedure that uses a magnet , radio waves , and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the brain    .
A substance called gadolinium is injected into a vein    .
The gadolinium collects around the tumor cells so they show up brighter in the picture    .
This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging ( NMRI )    .
- Blood chemistry studies :
A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body    .
An unusual ( higher or lower than normal ) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease    .
- Blood hormone studies : A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain hormones released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body    .
An unusual ( higher or lower than normal ) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease in the organ or tissue that makes it    .
For example , the blood may be checked for unusual levels of thyroid - stimulating hormone ( TSH ) or adrenocorticotropic hormone ( ACTH )    .
TSH and ACTH are made by the pituitary gland in the brain    .
Childhood craniopharyngiomas are diagnosed and may be removed in the same surgery    .
Doctors may think a mass is a craniopharyngioma based on where it is in the brain and how it looks on a CT scan or MRI    .
In order to be sure , a sample of tissue is needed    .
One of the following types of biopsy procedures may be used to take the sample of tissue : - Open biopsy : A hollow needle is inserted through a hole in the skull into the brain    .
- Computer - guided needle biopsy : A hollow needle guided by a computer is inserted through a small hole in the skull into the brain    .
- Transsphenoidal biopsy : Instruments are inserted through the nose and sphenoid bone ( a butterfly - shaped bone at the base of the skull ) and into the brain    .
A pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to look for tumor cells    .
If tumor cells are found , as much tumor as safely possible may be removed during the same surgery    .
The following laboratory test may be done on the sample of tissue that is removed : - Immunohistochemistry :
A test that uses antibodies to check for certain antigens in a sample of tissue    .
The antibody is usually linked to a radioactive substance or a dye that causes the tissue to light up under a microscope    .
This type of test may be used to tell the difference between different types of cancer    .
What is the outlook for Childhood Craniopharyngioma ?
Certain factors affect prognosis ( chance of recovery ) and treatment options    .
The prognosis ( chance of recovery ) and treatment options depend on the following : - The size of the tumor    .    - Where the tumor is in the brain    .
- Whether there are tumor cells left after surgery    .
- The child 's age    .
- Side effects that may occur months or years after treatment    .
- Whether the tumor has just been diagnosed or has recurred ( come back )    .
What are the stages of Childhood Craniopharyngioma ?
The process used to find out if cancer has spread within the brain or to other parts of the body is called staging    .
There is no standard system for staging childhood craniopharyngioma    .
Craniopharyngioma is described as newly diagnosed disease or recurrent disease    .
The results of the tests and procedures done to diagnose craniopharyngioma are used to help make decisions about treatment    .
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Childhood Craniopharyngioma ?
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
For some patients , taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice    .
Clinical trials are part of the medical research process    .
Clinical trials are done to find out if new treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment    .
Many of today 's standard treatments are based on earlier clinical trials    .
Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment    .
Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way diseases will be treated in the future    .
Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments , they often answer important questions and help move research forward    .
Check the list of NCI - supported cancer clinical trials that are now accepting patients with childhood craniopharyngioma    .
For more specific results , refine the search by using other search features , such as the location of the trial , the type of treatment , or the name of the drug    .
Talk with your child 's doctor about clinical trials that may be right for your child    .
General information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website    .
Patients can enter clinical trials before , during , or after starting their treatment    .
Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment    .
Other trials test treatments for patients who have not improved    .
There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop a disease from recurring ( coming back ) or reduce the side effects of treatment    .
Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country    .

There are different types of treatment for children with craniopharyngioma    .
Different types of treatments are available for children with craniopharyngioma    .
Some treatments are standard ( the currently used treatment ) , and some are being tested in clinical trials    .
A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with tumors    .
When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment , the new treatment may become the standard treatment    .
Because tumors in children are rare , taking part in a clinical trial should be considered    .
Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country    .
Information about ongoing clinical trials is available from the NCI website    .
Choosing the most appropriate treatment is a decision that ideally involves the patient , family , and health care team    .
Children with craniopharyngioma should have their treatment planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating brain tumors in children    .
Treatment will be overseen by a pediatric oncologist , a doctor who specializes in treating children with tumors    .
The pediatric oncologist works with other pediatric healthcare providers who are experts in treating children with brain tumors and who specialize in certain areas of medicine    .
These may include the following specialists : - Pediatrician    .    - Neurosurgeon    .    - Radiation oncologist    .    - Neurologist    .    - Endocrinologist    .    - Ophthalmologist    .
- Rehabilitation specialist    .
- Psychologist    .
- Social worker    .
- Nurse specialist    .
Childhood brain tumors may cause signs or symptoms that begin before the cancer is diagnosed and continue for months or years    .
Signs or symptoms caused by the tumor may begin before diagnosis and continue for months or years    .
It is important to talk with your child 's doctors about signs or symptoms caused by the tumor that may continue after treatment    .
Some treatments for tumors cause side effects months or years after treatment has ended    .
Side effects from tumor treatment that begin during or after treatment and continue for months or years are called late effects    .
Late effects of tumor treatment may include the following : - Physical problems such as seizures    .
- Behavior problems    .    - Changes in mood , feelings , thinking , learning , or memory    .
- Second cancers ( new types of cancer )    .
The following serious physical problems may occur if the pituitary gland , hypothalamus , optic nerves , or carotid artery are affected during surgery or radiation therapy : - Obesity    .
- Metabolic syndrome , including fatty liver disease not caused by drinking alcohol    .
- Vision problems , including blindness    .
- Blood vessel problems or stroke    .
- Loss of the ability to make certain hormones    .
Some late effects may be treated or controlled    .
Life - long hormone replacement therapy with several medicines may be needed    .
It is important to talk with your child 's doctors about the effects tumor treatment can have on your child    .
( See the PDQ summary on Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer for more information )    .
Five types of treatment are used :
Surgery ( resection )
The way the surgery is done depends on the size of the tumor and where it is in the brain    .
It also depends on whether the tumor has grown into nearby tissue in a finger - like way and expected late effects after surgery    .
The types of surgery that may be used to remove all of the tumor that can be seen with the eye include the following : - Transsphenoidal surgery : A type of surgery in which the instruments are inserted into part of the brain by going through an incision ( cut ) made under the upper lip or at the bottom of the nose between the nostrils and then through the sphenoid bone ( a butterfly - shaped bone at the base of the skull )    .
- Craniotomy : Surgery to remove the tumor through an opening made in the skull    .
Sometimes all of the tumor that can be seen is removed in surgery and no further treatment is needed    .
At other times , it is hard to remove the tumor because it is growing into or pressing on nearby organs    .
If there is tumor remaining after the surgery , radiation therapy is usually given to kill any tumor cells that are left    .
Treatment given after the surgery , to lower the risk that the cancer will come back , is called adjuvant therapy    .
Surgery and radiation therapy Partial resection is used to treat some craniopharyngiomas    .
It is used to diagnose the tumor , remove fluid from a cyst , and relieve pressure on the optic nerves    .
If the tumor is near the pituitary gland or hypothalamus , it is not removed    .
This reduces the number of serious side effects after surgery    .
Partial resection is followed by radiation therapy    .
Radiation therapy is a tumor treatment that uses high - energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill tumor cells or keep them from growing    .
- Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles , seeds , wires , or catheters that are placed directly into or near the tumor    .
The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type of tumor , whether the tumor is newly diagnosed or has come back , and where the tumor formed in the brain    .
External and internal radiation therapy are used to treat childhood craniopharyngioma    .
Because radiation therapy to the brain can affect growth and development in young children , ways of giving radiation therapy that have fewer side effects are being used    .
These include : - Stereotactic radiosurgery :
For very small craniopharyngiomas at the base of the brain , stereotactic radiosurgery may be used    .
Stereotactic radiosurgery is a type of external radiation therapy    .
A rigid head frame is attached to the skull to keep the head still during the radiation treatment    .
A machine aims a single large dose of radiation directly at the tumor    .
This procedure does not involve surgery    .
It is also called stereotaxic radiosurgery , radiosurgery , and radiation surgery    .
- Intracavitary radiation therapy : Intracavitary radiation therapy is a type of internal radiation therapy that may be used in tumors that are part solid mass and part fluid - filled cyst    .
Radioactive material is placed inside the tumor    .
This type of radiation therapy causes less damage to the nearby hypothalamus and optic nerves    .
- Intensity - modulated proton therapy : A type of radiation therapy that uses streams of protons ( tiny particles with a positive charge ) to kill tumor cells    .
A computer is used to target the exact shape and location of the tumor with proton therapy    .
This type of 3 - dimensional radiation therapy may cause less damage to healthy tissue in the brain and other parts of the body    .
Proton radiation is different from x-ray radiation    .
Surgery with cyst drainage Surgery may be done to drain tumors that are mostly fluid - filled cysts    .
This lowers pressure in the brain and relieves symptoms    .
A catheter ( thin tube ) is inserted into the cyst and a small container is placed under the skin    .
The fluid drains into the container and is later removed    .
Sometimes , after the cyst is drained , a drug is put through the catheter into the cyst    .
This causes the inside wall of the cyst to scar and stops the cyst from making fluid or increases the amount of the time it takes for the fluid to build up again    .
Surgery to remove the tumor may be done after the cyst is drained    .
Chemotherapy Chemotherapy is a treatment that uses anticancer drugs to stop the growth of tumor cells , either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing    .
When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle , the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach tumor cells throughout the body ( systemic chemotherapy )    .
When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid or an organ , the drugs mainly affect tumor cells in those areas ( regional chemotherapy )    .
Intracavitary chemotherapy is a type of regional chemotherapy that places drugs directly into a cavity , such as a cyst    .
It is used for craniopharyngioma that has come back after treatment    .
Biologic therapy Biologic therapy is a treatment that uses the patients immune system to fight cancer    .
Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost , direct , or restore the bodys natural defenses against cancer    .
This type of cancer treatment is also called biotherapy or immunotherapy    .
For craniopharyngioma that has come back after treatment , the biologic therapy drug is placed inside the tumor using a catheter ( intracavitary ) or in a vein ( intravenous )    .
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
For some patients , taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice    .
Clinical trials are part of the medical research process    .
Clinical trials are done to find out if new treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment    .
Many of today 's standard treatments are based on earlier clinical trials    .
Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment    .
Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way diseases will be treated in the future    .
Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments , they often answer important questions and help move research forward    .
Check the list of NCI - supported cancer clinical trials that are now accepting patients with childhood craniopharyngioma    .

See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials    .
These have been retrieved from NCI 's clinical trials database    .
Follow - up tests may be needed    .
Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the disease or decide how to treat it may be repeated    .
Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working    .
Decisions about whether to continue , change , or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests    .
Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended    .
The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed    .
These tests are sometimes called follow - up tests or check - ups    .
After treatment , follow - up testing with MRI will be done for several years to check if the tumor has come back    .
Treatment Options for Childhood Craniopharyngioma
Newly Diagnosed Childhood Craniopharyngioma
Treatment of newly diagnosed childhood craniopharyngioma may include the following : - Surgery ( resection ) with or without radiation therapy    .
- Partial resection followed by radiation therapy    .

Recurrent Childhood Craniopharyngioma
Craniopharyngioma may recur ( come back ) no matter how it was treated the first time    .
Treatment options for recurrent childhood craniopharyngioma depend on the type of treatment that was given when the tumor was first diagnosed and the needs of the child    .
Treatment may include the following : - Surgery ( resection )    .
- External - beam radiation therapy    .
- Stereotactic radiosurgery    .
- Intracavitary radiation therapy    .

What is (are) Childhood Ependymoma ?
Key Points
- Childhood ependymoma is a disease in which malignant ( cancer ) cells form in the tissues of the brain and spinal cord    .
- There are different types of ependymomas    .
- The part of the brain that is affected depends on where the ependymoma forms    .
- The cause of most childhood brain tumors is unknown    .
- The signs and symptoms of childhood ependymoma are not the same in every child    .
- Tests that examine the brain and spinal cord are used to detect ( find ) childhood ependymoma    .
- Childhood ependymoma is diagnosed and removed in surgery    .
- Certain factors affect prognosis ( chance of recovery ) and treatment options    .
Childhood ependymoma is a disease in which malignant ( cancer ) cells form in the tissues of the brain and spinal cord    .
The brain controls vital functions such as memory and learning , emotion , and the senses ( hearing , sight , smell , taste , and touch )    .
The spinal cord is made up of bundles of nerve fibers that connect the brain with nerves in most parts of the body    .
Ependymomas form from ependymal cells that line the ventricles and passageways in the brain and the spinal cord    .
Ependymal cells make cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF )    .
This summary is about the treatment of primary brain tumors ( tumors that begin in the brain )    .
Treatment of metastatic brain tumors , which are tumors that begin in other parts of the body and spread to the brain , is not discussed in this summary    .
There are many different types of brain tumors    .
Brain tumors can occur in both children and adults    .
However , treatment for children is different than treatment for adults    .
See the following PDQ summaries for more information : - Childhood Brain and Spinal Cord Tumors Treatment Overview - Adult Central Nervous System Tumors Treatment
There are different types of ependymomas    .
The World Health Organization ( WHO ) groups ependymal tumors into five main subtypes : - Subependymoma ( WHO Grade I )    .
- Myxopapillary ependymoma ( WHO Grade I )    .    - Ependymoma ( WHO Grade II )    .
- RELA fusionpositive ependymoma ( WHO Grade II or Grade III with change in the RELA gene )    .
- Anaplastic ependymoma ( WHO Grade III )    .
The grade of a tumor describes how abnormal the cancer cells look under a microscope and how quickly the tumor is likely to grow and spread    .
Low - grade ( Grade I ) cancer cells look more like normal cells than high - grade cancer cells ( Grade II and III )    .
They also tend to grow and spread more slowly than Grade II and III cancer cells    .
The part of the brain that is affected depends on where the ependymoma forms    .
Ependymomas can form anywhere in the fluid - filled ventricles and passageways in the brain and spinal cord    .
Most ependymomas form in the fourth ventricle and affect the cerebellum and the brain stem    .
Once an ependymoma forms , areas of the brain that may be affected include : - Cerebrum :
The largest part of the brain , at the top of the head    .
The cerebrum controls thinking , learning , problem - solving , speech , emotions , reading , writing , and voluntary movement    .
- Cerebellum :
The lower , back part of the brain ( near the middle of the back of the head )    .
The cerebellum controls movement , balance , and posture    .
- Brain stem :
The part that connects the brain to the spinal cord , in the lowest part of the brain ( just above the back of the neck )    .
The brain stem controls breathing , heart rate , and the nerves and muscles used in seeing , hearing , walking , talking , and eating    .
- Spinal cord :
The column of nerve tissue that runs from the brain stem down the center of the back    .
It is covered by three thin layers of tissue called membranes    .
The spinal cord and membranes are surrounded by the vertebrae ( back bones )    .
Spinal cord nerves carry messages between the brain and the rest of the body , such as a message from the brain to cause muscles to move or a message from the skin to the brain to feel touch    .
What causes Childhood Ependymoma ?
The cause of most childhood brain tumors is unknown    .
What are the symptoms of Childhood Ependymoma ?
The signs and symptoms of childhood ependymoma are not the same in every child    .
Signs and symptoms depend on the following : - The child 's age    .
- Where the tumor has formed    .
Signs and symptoms may be caused by childhood ependymoma or by other conditions    .
Check with your child 's doctor if your child has any of the following : - Frequent headaches    .
- Seizures    .    - Nausea and vomiting    .
- Pain or stiffness in the neck    .
- Loss of balance or trouble walking    .
- Weakness in the legs    .
- Blurry vision    .    - Back pain    .    - A change in bowel function    .
- Trouble urinating    .
- Confusion or irritability    .
How to diagnose Childhood Ependymoma ?
Tests that examine the brain and spinal cord are used to detect ( find ) childhood ependymoma    .
The following tests and procedures may be used : - Physical exam and history :
An exam of the body to check general signs of health , including checking for signs of disease , such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual    .
A history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken    .
- Neurological exam :
A series of questions and tests to check the brain , spinal cord , and nerve function    .
The exam checks a persons mental status , coordination , and ability to walk normally , and how well the muscles , senses , and reflexes work    .
This may also be called a neuro exam or a neurologic exam    .
- MRI ( magnetic resonance imaging ) with gadolinium :
A procedure that uses a magnet , radio waves , and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the brain and spinal cord    .
A substance called gadolinium is injected into a vein and travels through the bloodstream    .
The gadolinium collects around the cancer cells so they show up brighter in the picture    .
This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging ( NMRI )    .
- Lumbar puncture : A procedure used to collect cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) from the spinal column    .
This is done by placing a needle between two bones in the spine and into the CSF around the spinal cord and removing a sample of fluid    .
The sample of CSF is checked under a microscope for signs of tumor cells    .
The sample may also be checked for the amounts of protein and glucose    .
A higher than normal amount of protein or lower than normal amount of glucose may be a sign of a tumor    .
This procedure is also called an LP or spinal tap    .
Childhood ependymoma is diagnosed and removed in surgery    .
If the diagnostic tests show there may be a brain tumor , a biopsy is done by removing part of the skull and using a needle to remove a sample of the brain tissue    .
A pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells    .
If cancer cells are found , the doctor will remove as much tumor as safely possible during the same surgery    .
The following test may be done on the tissue that was removed : - Immunohistochemistry :
A test that uses antibodies to check for certain antigens in a sample of tissue    .
The antibody is usually linked to a radioactive substance or a dye that causes the tissue to light up under a microscope    .
This type of test may be used to tell the difference between brain stem glioma and other brain tumors    .
An MRI is often done after the tumor is removed to find out whether any tumor remains    .
What is the outlook for Childhood Ependymoma ?
Certain factors affect prognosis ( chance of recovery ) and treatment options    .
The prognosis ( chance of recovery ) and treatment options depend on : - Where the tumor has formed in the central nervous system ( CNS )    .
- Whether there are certain changes in the genes or chromosomes    .
- Whether any cancer cells remain after surgery to remove the tumor    .
- The type of ependymoma    .    - The age of the child when the tumor is diagnosed    .
- Whether the cancer has spread to other parts of the brain or spinal cord    .
- Whether the tumor has just been diagnosed or has recurred ( come back )    .
Prognosis also depends on the type and dose of radiation therapy that is given    .
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Childhood Ependymoma ?
New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials    .
Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website    .
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
For some patients , taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice    .
Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process    .
Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment    .
Many of today 's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials    .
Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment    .
Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future    .
Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments , they often answer important questions and help move research forward    .
Patients can enter clinical trials before , during , or after starting their cancer treatment    .
Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment    .
Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better    .
There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring ( coming back ) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment    .
Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country    .

It is important to talk with your child 's doctors about the effects cancer treatment can have on your child    .
( See the PDQ summary on Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer for more information )    .
Four types of standard treatment are used :
Surgery
If the results of diagnostic tests show there may be a brain tumor , a biopsy is done by removing part of the skull and using a needle to remove a sample of the brain tissue    .
A pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to check for cancer cells    .
If cancer cells are found , the doctor will remove as much tumor as safely possible during the same surgery    .
An MRI is often done after the tumor is removed to find out whether any tumor remains    .
If tumor remains , a second surgery to remove as much of the remaining tumor as possible may be done    .
Even if the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery , some patients may be given chemotherapy or radiation therapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left    .
Treatment to lower the risk that the cancer will come back after surgery is called adjuvant therapy    .
Radiation therapy Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high - energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing    .
There are two types of radiation therapy : - External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer    .
Certain ways of giving radiation therapy can help keep radiation from damaging nearby healthy tissue    .
These types of radiation therapy include the following : - Conformal radiation therapy : Conformal radiation therapy is a type of external radiation therapy that uses a computer to make a 3 - dimensional ( 3 - D ) picture of the tumor and shapes the radiation beams to fit the tumor    .
- Intensity - modulated radiation therapy ( IMRT ) : IMRT is a type of 3 - dimensional ( 3 - D ) radiation therapy that uses a computer to make pictures of the size and shape of the tumor    .
Thin beams of radiation of different intensities ( strengths ) are aimed at the tumor from many angles    .
- Proton - beam radiation therapy : Proton - beam therapy is a type of high - energy , external radiation therapy    .
A radiation therapy machine aims streams of protons ( tiny , invisible , positively - charged particles ) at the cancer cells to kill them    .
- Stereotactic radiosurgery : Stereotactic radiosurgery is a type of external radiation therapy    .
A rigid head frame is attached to the skull to keep the head still during the radiation treatment    .
A machine aims a single large dose of radiation directly at the tumor    .
This procedure does not involve surgery    .
It is also called stereotaxic radiosurgery , radiosurgery , and radiation surgery    .
- Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles , seeds , wires , or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer    .
The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type of cancer being treated    .
External radiation therapy is used to treat childhood ependymoma    .
Children younger than 3 years who receive radiation therapy to the brain have a higher risk of problems with growth and development than older children    .
3 - D conformal radiation therapy and proton - beam therapy are being studied in children younger than 3 years to see if the effects of radiation on growth and development are lessened    .
Chemotherapy Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells , either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing    .
When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle , the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body ( systemic chemotherapy )    .
When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid , an organ , or a body cavity such as the abdomen , the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas ( regional chemotherapy )    .
The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type of cancer being treated    .
Observation Observation is closely monitoring a patients condition without giving any treatment until signs or symptoms appear or change    .
Observation may be used to treat a child with a subependymoma who has no symptoms and whose tumor is found while treating another condition    .
New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials    .
Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website    .
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
For some patients , taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice    .
Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process    .
Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment    .
Many of today 's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials    .
Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment    .
Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future    .
Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments , they often answer important questions and help move research forward    .
Patients can enter clinical trials before , during , or after starting their cancer treatment    .
Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment    .
Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better    .
There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring ( coming back ) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment    .
Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country    .
See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials    .
These have been retrieved from NCI 's listing of clinical trials    .
Follow - up tests may be needed    .
Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated    .
Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working    .
Decisions about whether to continue , change , or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests    .
Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended    .
The results of these tests can show if your child 's condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred ( come back )    .
These tests are sometimes called follow - up tests or check - ups    .
Follow - up tests for childhood ependymoma include an MRI ( magnetic resonance imaging ) of the brain and spinal cord every 3 months for the first 1 or 2 years after treatment    .
After 2 years , MRIs may be done every 6 months for the next 3 years    .
Treatment Options for Childhood Ependymoma
Newly Diagnosed Childhood Ependymoma
A child with a newly diagnosed ependymoma has not had treatment for the tumor    .
The child may have had treatment to relieve signs or symptoms caused by the tumor    .
Subependymoma
Treatment of newly diagnosed subependymoma ( WHO Grade I ) is : - Surgery    .    - Observation ( rarely )    .
Myxopapillary ependymoma
Treatment of newly diagnosed myxopapillary ependymoma ( WHO Grade I ) is : - Surgery with or without radiation therapy    .
Childhood ependymoma , anaplastic ependymoma , or RELA fusionpositive ependymoma Treatment of newly diagnosed childhood ependymoma ( WHO Grade II ) , anaplastic ependymoma ( WHO Grade III ) , or RELA fusionpositive ependymoma ( WHO Grade II or Grade III ) is : - Surgery    .
After surgery , the plan for further treatment depends on the following : - Whether any cancer cells remain after surgery    .
- Whether the cancer has spread to other parts of the brain or spinal cord    .    - The age of the child    .
When the tumor is completely removed and cancer cells have not spread , treatment may include the following : - Radiation therapy    .    - A clinical trial of radiation therapy followed by chemotherapy    .    - A clinical trial of observation for patients whose tumor is completely removed or who have no sign of cancer after chemotherapy    .
When part of the tumor remains after surgery , but cancer cells have not spread , treatment may include the following : - A second surgery to remove as much of the remaining tumor as possible    .
- Radiation therapy    .
- Chemotherapy followed by radiation therapy    .    - A clinical trial of chemotherapy given before and after radiation therapy    .
When cancer cells have spread within the brain and spinal cord , treatment may include the following : - Radiation therapy to the brain and spinal cord    .

What is (are) Adult Primary Liver Cancer ?
Key Points
- Adult primary liver cancer is a disease in which malignant ( cancer ) cells form in the tissues of the liver    .
- There are two types of adult primary liver cancer    .
- Having hepatitis or cirrhosis can affect the risk of adult primary liver cancer    .
- Signs and symptoms of adult primary liver cancer include a lump or pain on the right side    .
- Tests that examine the liver and the blood are used to detect ( find ) and diagnose adult primary liver cancer    .
- Certain factors affect prognosis ( chance of recovery ) and treatment options    .
Adult primary liver cancer is a disease in which malignant ( cancer ) cells form in the tissues of the liver    .
The liver is one of the largest organs in the body    .
It has four lobes and fills the upper right side of the abdomen inside the rib cage    .
Three of the many important functions of the liver are : - To filter harmful substances from the blood so they can be passed from the body in stools and urine    .
- To make bile to help digest fat that comes from food    .
- To store glycogen ( sugar ) , which the body uses for energy    .
There are two types of adult primary liver cancer    .
The two types of adult primary liver cancer are : - Hepatocellular carcinoma    .    - Cholangiocarcinoma ( bile duct cancer )    .
( See the PDQ summary on Bile Duct Cancer Treatment for more information    .    )
The most common type of adult primary liver cancer is hepatocellular carcinoma    .
This type of liver cancer is the third leading cause of cancer - related deaths worldwide    .
This summary is about the treatment of primary liver cancer ( cancer that begins in the liver )    .
Treatment of cancer that begins in other parts of the body and spreads to the liver is not covered in this summary    .
Primary liver cancer can occur in both adults and children    .
However , treatment for children is different than treatment for adults    .
( See the PDQ summary on Childhood Liver Cancer Treatment for more information    .    )
Who is at risk for Adult Primary Liver Cancer? ?
Having hepatitis or cirrhosis can affect the risk of adult primary liver cancer    .
Anything that increases your chance of getting a disease is called a risk factor    .
Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer ; not having risk factors doesnt mean that you will not get cancer    .
Talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk    .
The following are risk factors for adult primary liver cancer : - Having hepatitis B or hepatitis C   .    Having both hepatitis B and hepatitis C increases the risk even more    .
- Having cirrhosis , which can be caused by : - hepatitis ( especially hepatitis C ) ; or - drinking large amounts of alcohol for many years or being an alcoholic    .
- Having metabolic syndrome , a set of conditions that occur together , including extra fat around the abdomen , high blood sugar , high blood pressure , high levels of triglycerides and low levels of high - density lipoproteins in the blood    .
- Having liver injury that is long - lasting , especially if it leads to cirrhosis    .
- Having hemochromatosis , a condition in which the body takes up and stores more iron than it needs    .
The extra iron is stored in the liver , heart , and pancreas - Eating foods tainted with aflatoxin ( poison from a fungus that can grow on foods , such as grains and nuts , that have not been stored properly )    .
What are the symptoms of Adult Primary Liver Cancer ?
Signs and symptoms of adult primary liver cancer include a lump or pain on the right side    .
These and other signs and symptoms may be caused by adult primary liver cancer or by other conditions    .
Check with your doctor if you have any of the following : - A hard lump on the right side just below the rib cage    .
- Discomfort in the upper abdomen on the right side    .    - A swollen abdomen    .    - Pain near the right shoulder blade or in the back    .
- Jaundice ( yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes )    .
- Easy bruising or bleeding    .
- Unusual tiredness or weakness    .
- Nausea and vomiting    .
- Loss of appetite or feelings of fullness after eating a small meal    .
- Weight loss for no known reason    .
- Pale , chalky bowel movements and dark urine    .
- Fever    .
How to diagnose Adult Primary Liver Cancer ?
Tests that examine the liver and the blood are used to detect ( find ) and diagnose adult primary liver cancer    .
The following tests and procedures may be used : - Physical exam and history :
An exam of the body to check general signs of health , including checking for signs of disease , such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual    .
A history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken    .
- Serum tumor marker test :
A procedure in which a sample of blood is examined to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs , tissues , or tumor cells in the body    .
Certain substances are linked to specific types of cancer when found in increased levels in the blood    .
These are called tumor markers    .
An increased level of alpha - fetoprotein ( AFP ) in the blood may be a sign of liver cancer    .
Other cancers and certain noncancerous conditions , including cirrhosis and hepatitis , may also increase AFP levels    .
Sometimes the AFP level is normal even when there is liver cancer    .
- Liver function tests :
A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by the liver    .
A higher than normal amount of a substance can be a sign of liver cancer    .
- CT scan ( CAT scan ) : A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body , such as the abdomen , taken from different angles    .
The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine    .
A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly    .
This procedure is also called computed tomography , computerized tomography , or computerized axial tomography    .
Images may be taken at three different times after the dye is injected , to get the best picture of abnormal areas in the liver    .
This is called triple - phase CT    .
A spiral or helical CT scan makes a series of very detailed pictures of areas inside the body using an x-ray machine that scans the body in a spiral path    .
- MRI ( magnetic resonance imaging ) : A procedure that uses a magnet , radio waves , and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body , such as the liver    .
This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging ( NMRI )    .
To create detailed pictures of blood vessels in and near the liver , dye is injected into a vein    .
This procedure is called MRA ( magnetic resonance angiography )    .
Images may be taken at three different times after the dye is injected , to get the best picture of abnormal areas in the liver    .
This is called triple - phase MRI    .
- Ultrasound exam :
A procedure in which high - energy sound waves ( ultrasound ) are bounced off internal tissues or organs and make echoes    .
The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram    .
The picture can be printed to be looked at later    .
- Biopsy :
The removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer    .
Procedures used to collect the sample of cells or tissues include the following : - Fine - needle aspiration biopsy :
The removal of cells , tissue or fluid using a thin needle    .
- Core needle biopsy :
The removal of cells or tissue using a slightly wider needle    .
- Laparoscopy : A surgical procedure to look at the organs inside the abdomen to check for signs of disease    .
Small incisions ( cuts ) are made in the wall of the abdomen and a laparoscope ( a thin , lighted tube ) is inserted into one of the incisions    .
Another instrument is inserted through the same or another incision to remove the tissue samples    .
A biopsy is not always needed to diagnose adult primary liver cancer    .
What is the outlook for Adult Primary Liver Cancer ?
Certain factors affect prognosis ( chance of recovery ) and treatment options    .
The prognosis ( chance of recovery ) and treatment options depend on the following : - The stage of the cancer ( the size of the tumor , whether it affects part or all of the liver , or has spread to other places in the body )    .
- How well the liver is working    .
- The patients general health , including whether there is cirrhosis of the liver    .
What are the stages of Adult Primary Liver Cancer ?
Key Points
- After adult primary liver cancer has been diagnosed , tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the liver or to other parts of the body    .
- There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body    .
- Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body    .
- The Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer Staging System may be used to stage adult primary liver cancer    .    - The following groups are used to plan treatment    .
- BCLC stages 0 , A , and B - BCLC stages C and D
After adult primary liver cancer has been diagnosed , tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the liver or to other parts of the body    .
The process used to find out if cancer has spread within the liver or to other parts of the body is called staging    .
The information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease    .
It is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment    .
The following tests and procedures may be used in the staging process : - CT scan ( CAT scan ) :
A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body , such as the chest , abdomen , and pelvis , taken from different angles    .
The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine    .
A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly    .
This procedure is also called computed tomography , computerized tomography , or computerized axial tomography    .
- MRI ( magnetic resonance imaging ) : A procedure that uses a magnet , radio waves , and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body    .
This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging ( NMRI )    .
- PET scan ( positron emission tomography scan ) : A procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body    .
A small amount of radioactive glucose ( sugar ) is injected into a vein    .
The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body    .
Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do    .
There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body    .
Cancer can spread through tissue , the lymph system , and the blood : - Tissue    .
The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas    .
- Lymph system    .
The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system    .
The cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body    .
- Blood    .
The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood    .
The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body    .
Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body    .
When cancer spreads to another part of the body , it is called metastasis    .
Cancer cells break away from where they began ( the primary tumor ) and travel through the lymph system or blood    .
- Lymph system    .
The cancer gets into the lymph system , travels through the lymph vessels , and forms a tumor ( metastatic tumor ) in another part of the body    .
- Blood    .
The cancer gets into the blood , travels through the blood vessels , and forms a tumor ( metastatic tumor ) in another part of the body    .
The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor    .
For example , if primary liver cancer spreads to the lung , the cancer cells in the lung are actually liver cancer cells    .
The disease is metastatic liver cancer , not lung cancer    .
The Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer Staging System may be used to stage adult primary liver cancer    .
There are several staging systems for liver cancer    .
The Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer ( BCLC ) Staging System is widely used and is described below    .
This system is used to predict the patient 's chance of recovery and to plan treatment , based on the following : - Whether the cancer has spread within the liver or to other parts of the body    .
- How well the liver is working    .
- The general health and wellness of the patient    .
- The symptoms caused by the cancer    .
The BCLC staging system has five stages : - Stage 0 : Very early - Stage A : Early - Stage B : Intermediate - Stage C : Advanced - Stage D : End-stage
The following groups are used to plan treatment    .
BCLC stages 0 , A , and B Treatment to cure the cancer is given for BCLC stages 0 , A , and B   .    BCLC stages C and D Treatment to relieve the symptoms caused by liver cancer and improve the patient 's quality of life is given for BCLC stages C and D   .    Treatments are not likely to cure the cancer    .
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Adult Primary Liver Cancer ?
New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials    .
Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website    .
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
For some patients , taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice    .
Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process    .
Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment    .
Many of today 's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials    .
Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment    .
Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future    .
Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments , they often answer important questions and help move research forward    .
Patients can enter clinical trials before , during , or after starting their cancer treatment    .
Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment    .
Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better    .
There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring ( coming back ) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment    .
Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country    .
See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials    .

What are the treatments for Adult Primary Liver Cancer ?
Key Points
- There are different types of treatment for patients with adult primary liver cancer    .
- Patients with liver cancer are treated by a team of specialists who are experts in treating liver cancer    .
- Seven types of standard treatment are used : - Surveillance - Surgery - Liver transplant - Ablation therapy - Embolization therapy - Targeted therapy - Radiation therapy - New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials    .
- Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
- Patients can enter clinical trials before , during , or after starting their cancer treatment    .
- Follow - up tests may be needed    .
There are different types of treatment for patients with adult primary liver cancer    .
Different types of treatments are available for patients with adult primary liver cancer    .
Some treatments are standard ( the currently used treatment ) , and some are being tested in clinical trials    .
A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer    .
When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment , the new treatment may become the standard treatment    .
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment    .
Patients with liver cancer are treated by a team of specialists who are experts in treating liver cancer    .
The patient 's treatment will be overseen by a medical oncologist , a doctor who specializes in treating people with cancer    .
The medical oncologist may refer the patient to other health professionals who have special training in treating patients with liver cancer    .
These may include the following specialists : - Hepatologist ( specialist in liver disease )    .
- Surgical oncologist    .
- Transplant surgeon    .
- Radiation oncologist    .
- Interventional radiologist ( a specialist who diagnoses and treats diseases using imaging and the smallest incisions possible )    .
- Pathologist    .
Seven types of standard treatment are used :
Surveillance Surveillance for lesions smaller than 1 centimeter found during screening    .
Follow - up every three months is common    .
Surgery A partial hepatectomy ( surgery to remove the part of the liver where cancer is found ) may be done    .
A wedge of tissue , an entire lobe , or a larger part of the liver , along with some of the healthy tissue around it is removed    .
The remaining liver tissue takes over the functions of the liver and may regrow    .
Liver transplant
In a liver transplant , the entire liver is removed and replaced with a healthy donated liver    .
A liver transplant may be done when the disease is in the liver only and a donated liver can be found    .
If the patient has to wait for a donated liver , other treatment is given as needed    .
Ablation therapy Ablation therapy removes or destroys tissue    .
Different types of ablation therapy are used for liver cancer : - Radiofrequency ablation :
The use of special needles that are inserted directly through the skin or through an incision in the abdomen to reach the tumor    .
High - energy radio waves heat the needles and tumor which kills cancer cells    .
- Microwave therapy : A type of treatment in which the tumor is exposed to high temperatures created by microwaves    .
This can damage and kill cancer cells or make them more sensitive to the effects of radiation and certain anticancer drugs    .
- Percutaneous ethanol injection : A cancer treatment in which a small needle is used to inject ethanol ( pure alcohol ) directly into a tumor to kill cancer cells    .
Several treatments may be needed    .
Usually local anesthesia is used , but if the patient has many tumors in the liver , general anesthesia may be used    .
- Cryoablation : A treatment that uses an instrument to freeze and destroy cancer cells    .
This type of treatment is also called cryotherapy and cryosurgery    .
The doctor may use ultrasound to guide the instrument    .
- Electroporation therapy : A treatment that sends electrical pulses through an electrode placed in a tumor to kill cancer cells    .
Electroporation therapy is being studied in clinical trials    .
Embolization therapy Embolization therapy is the use of substances to block or decrease the flow of blood through the hepatic artery to the tumor    .
When the tumor does not get the oxygen and nutrients it needs , it will not continue to grow    .
Embolization therapy is used for patients who cannot have surgery to remove the tumor or ablation therapy and whose tumor has not spread outside the liver    .
The liver receives blood from the hepatic portal vein and the hepatic artery    .
Blood that comes into the liver from the hepatic portal vein usually goes to the healthy liver tissue    .
Blood that comes from the hepatic artery usually goes to the tumor    .
When the hepatic artery is blocked during embolization therapy , the healthy liver tissue continues to receive blood from the hepatic portal vein    .
There are two main types of embolization therapy : - Transarterial embolization ( TAE ) : A small incision ( cut ) is made in the inner thigh and a catheter ( thin , flexible tube ) is inserted and threaded up into the hepatic artery    .
Once the catheter is in place , a substance that blocks the hepatic artery and stops blood flow to the tumor is injected    .
- Transarterial chemoembolization ( TACE ) :
This procedure is like TAE except an anticancer drug is also given    .
The procedure can be done by attaching the anticancer drug to small beads that are injected into the hepatic artery or by injecting the anticancer drug through the catheter into the hepatic artery and then injecting the substance to block the hepatic artery    .
Most of the anticancer drug is trapped near the tumor and only a small amount of the drug reaches other parts of the body    .
This type of treatment is also called chemoembolization    .
Targeted therapy Targeted therapy is a treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells    .
Adult liver cancer may be treated with a targeted therapy drug that stops cells from dividing and prevents the growth of new blood vessels that tumors need to grow    .
See Drugs Approved for Liver Cancer for more information    .
Radiation therapy Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high - energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing    .
Certain ways of giving radiation therapy can help keep radiation from damaging nearby healthy tissue    .
These types of external radiation therapy include the following : - Conformal radiation therapy : Conformal radiation therapy is a type of external radiation therapy that uses a computer to make a 3 - dimensional ( 3 - D ) picture of the tumor and shapes the radiation beams to fit the tumor    .
This allows a high dose of radiation to reach the tumor and causes less damage to nearby healthy tissue    .
- Stereotactic body radiation therapy : Stereotactic body radiation therapy is a type of external radiation therapy    .
Special equipment is used to place the patient in the same position for each radiation treatment    .
Once a day for several days , a radiation machine aims a larger than usual dose of radiation directly at the tumor    .
By having the patient in the same position for each treatment , there is less damage to nearby healthy tissue    .
This procedure is also called stereotactic external - beam radiation therapy and stereotaxic radiation therapy    .
- Proton beam radiation therapy : Proton - beam therapy is a type of high - energy , external radiation therapy    .
A radiation therapy machine aims streams of protons ( tiny , invisible , positively - charged particles ) at the cancer cells to kill them    .
This type of treatment causes less damage to nearby healthy tissue    .
- Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles , seeds , wires , or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer    .
The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated    .
External radiation therapy is used to treat adult primary liver cancer    .
New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials    .
Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website    .
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
