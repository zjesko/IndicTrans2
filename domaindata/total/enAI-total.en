Because, as I said, you begin with random set of weights.
okay , The same thing can be shared in hundred odd ways or even more ways if you are a poet or somebody like that.
Now, this is called Depth-first search.
The summation should be less than zero but it is going above zero.
So, we don't need to bother much about the theory issue.
We have so far looked at the MiniMax algorithm itself where the structure node info, the recursive version of the algorithm, three different components of a recursive algorithm and how MiniMax actually does all this jobs, how MiniMax algorithm continuous recursively calls itself till it reaches the leaf node and applying static evolution function there and then backs the value up in the unwinding part and chooses the best move.
Here, we don't do that, okay though we say that.
At the maximizing layer, we have the same choice we’ll choose win, okay , so, because we are going to play.
Okay , the next search method that we’re going to we’re going to talk about is called best first search.
So, there may be more and this again we are talking about real systems, where there are more than one correct responses, which is quite possible we are we are dealing with real It is quite possible that one expert says that malaria, the other says typhoid and the patient actually has both of them.
But look at ‘slash’.
So you can see that when script is invoked, all of these are assumed .
If you have that domain knowledge here you can say which move is better than the other, is called heuristic.
People use a lot of other names for this and one very good domain which is called crowdsourcing is also doing something quite similar.
So, more numbers you provide, in most cases it is better.
It is impossible in in some cases but it is it is possible in some cases as well.
Precondition is that A has to be free, that is, nothing should be resting on A then and then you can put it on table otherwise you cannot.
Unlike that we can't pour milk out of the jug.
Suppose it finds the food source, it follows the same path to come back.
It is also possible that in fact, empirically it is it has solved many problems.
Remember, the calculation we requires everything every the sigma that we have seen X X one W one X two W two X three W three and so on.
Chess-playing programs usually have time associated so it says that you have five minutes, in five minutes you'll have to find out whatever you can.
What does that do?
For example, somebody speaking in Hindi and the the listener is French .
W one is layer one, W two is layer two, I and J.
So six is not allowed .
Okay .
He stabbed Ravan or shot Ravan or cut his head into two by sword.
Now let us see how the next method called Breadth-first search works.
okay , If it is feasible to have some machine learning, so, you just can take data from reputed sources like doctor’s logs and and the blog is written by somebody and genuine medical books and things like that and and just bring it to the database.
We’re also seeing it that it is possible to apply a little different type of a search called solution search where every node in this search space represents a solution.
Okay . Okay And I've already talked about sparse neighbourhood and dense neighbourhood and there is something called variable neighbourhood.
Or generate, from this solution state you generate other solution states and find out which one is better and then you move there,
You have multiple neighbours, multiple solutions possible.
So we would like to explore and try to figure out what how good a particular move is and go further we are more sure.
So, we have the last one is W one M one okay .
And reproduction process helps the genes to carry from parent to offspring, okay .
In fact, our solution you probably have seen that a few places we are just pouring the water out of the jug because water is inexpensive which is not there stated in the problem itself.
Those are all implicitly mentioned when we talk in in a normal way.
Why?
Progression is moving towards the goal state, regression is coming back from the goal state.
Now what we are doing?
And they realized that even experts make mistake.
One, the ability to hear and smell and the other ability is to run fast.
The critic, the person who is going to evaluate is is also an expert but then is not the same He is going to validate this model.
Okay . You probably think that it’s a bit wasteful.
So, that's the power of CD .
We just say that A B C D is not equal to six, twelve or four.
In this case, you can see that on on the slide, that we assumed output units to be six, the input units eighty-one.
Okay , scripts were great but then they were quite isolated.
Fr is farmer, fx is fox, ch is chicken and Gr is grain.
Quite interesting observation can be seen from what we are doing on the right hand side.
So you don't require to apply minimum, it's always maximum.
That solution space is now you know, we we can start travelling in search space using two methods.
Now, B becomes minus three though there is a a node which can guarantee a very good that thing , but opponent is not going to play that for us.
So that is represented as picture aiders in in CD .
You can see that in the initial movements, first four movements, we are not actually moving missionaries.
We almost always explore game trees partially because most cases it is impossible to do one.
So, that is one important thing that happens here.
Take a set of random sequences as nodes in the state space, the solution space.
Now you can see that there are two different conceptualization and there this shows a relationship between them.
So, if you do that you probably will start with one and then the other so placing D on the table.
So it is become so for our case there are total three sixty different tours possible between these seven cities.
And remember a true sense of direction can only come if you have a good heuristic okay , otherwise you won't have so that's the point here that I will like to make.
Like if I want to change this ‘attack’ to to primitives, I need to again make it more complicated which I do not want to do.
So what we’re doing is is is kind of a generate and test, we’ll just look at a sequence.
In fact, there are many ways of doing it.
I have already discussed that thing.
So, we we we begin from an initial state, we move across in the state space using moves that we have.
Moving upon one step further or two step further and you have eight points.
And the second principle of GA is that when better elements when better individuals meet they produce even better offspring.
So, what you do is you just pick up the first segment and this.
One is called LOC or location, which talks about where this thing happened.
What's the advantage?
So, there are three different conceptualizations acting together to represent a given statement, Okay .
That's the other option.
Suppose example there are ten moves and you reach to seventh move which is not acceptable, so seven eight nine ten four moves you can take all combinations of that and try.
A relevant state is where it moves towards the goal stack okay .
So, all users can have it and so on so forth, can be quite quite handy, quite useful.
So, how it is done that X is inserted on the stack, Y is inserted on the stack, Z is inserted on the stack and you solve Z first then Y f then and then X or you insert Z Y X and then solve it that way and so on so forth.
Okay , let's move on.
What does that mean?
If it is phi means that you have deleted something which is not part of the goal state then it is absolutely fine.
And here is an example, we start with a random side of parents say twenty and then find their fitness values and choose better five, generate thirty offspring, how you get, because there are fifteen distinct pairs of five offspring that which which which generate two children so you get thirty. Okay .
If you negate it, you always have to apply one function maximizing and you will get the same answer.
But otherwise, the later two search methods will eventually stop.
okay .
Okay , now you might be getting the feel for the problems AI researchers are facing over the years.
So that third arrow points to the object which is being moved from this location to that location.
What's the point in travelling along?
First, which are already explored.
Now, for example, eight zero zero that is converted to zero five three.
It is done using some practical implementation and comparing with the results and you use the best one which suits you, suits that problem actually.
So this is how I can apply heuristic function and get the move that I should choose rather than exploring all of them like breadth-first or exploring one branch and then the second branch and the third branch like DFS.
And the state generated , should not be generated again , that is what we mean by a cycle.
The first activation function that we look at is called Square, which we have already seen.
So, it is possible that you choose them you use something else to choose.
We must start with 4,8 and 9,2,7 and so and so forth.
Okay a very similar thing is not only time but a place. I saw a match in Nagpur.
Here, we have three missionaries and three cannibals on one side of a river.
You may be surprised re-running the program, how it solves?
And my pawn, if I place the pawn in the position that is shown that pawn’s position at that point of time is more than a queen's position because that will help me check the king and the game will be over.
There is a reason.
Okay , so those fleeting scripts is also an interesting problem.
Technically, it is pretty simple.
How GA works?
Remember, when we’re at the solution?
State space is about representing the problem in a computer understandable form.
Okay , let me tell you one more thing, this is my way of representing.
People at the forensic does something like this.
In the beginning they travel at the constant speed and they spray pheromone along the path.
They can't think of it.
So, if farmer is on one side, the other side, you can't have farm.
Now MTRANS is is quite important here for example, a verb called reading is what?
You did that because you could associate this information and search in associative way.
Again, the difference is to be removed; this is how it works.
When somebody tells us something like this and we don't know what Epicurean is we will ask what is it? Okay .
I’ve already told earlier that however simple this looks like the block’s world problem can be pretty useful for robots to work.
That’s the problem.
If I have to search the key in entire house, it is useless .
Now you can clearly see that path one is little shorter.
You cannot pour it out.
You don’t have complete information about the current status but you will soon be able to find your own way out, based on the old memories little part of something that you can remember.
And sixty-two if it is upper lower case as well as digits.
This is the best method because you were exploring everything in parallels.
This is the time where I've reached when the reached to the leaf node. I have reached to the leaf node, apply static evolution function okay and then that value is returned back.
So that that adds randomness to movement in the initial run in a way that you escape from local minima and it is proved to be quite useful.
Okay So, there is a unit one which learns to be active when the line one slanting line from going up from left to right okay .
So why it is not desirable?
So, that's the other addition.
And knowledge engineer that knowledge and expert also learns a lot out of it.
And this process is like black box.
There are two things to be done, what we want here A on the table and B on top of A.
So, once you do that, what you've done is you’ve identified components and given those values.
So, there is no point invoking that script, there's something wrong, okay .
Not all place you will find exactly the rules to be the same.
So, this is called degree of freedom, I don't have the the degree of freedom I should.
For example, when I worked with one of my student on intrusion detection system, both of us learn a lot of things out of it.
They are applied and what you get is the answer.
clears nose Okay so farmer cannot be on the both side.
The inputs are provided, outputs are generated and we correct those outputs by changing these weights.
Okay one after Jay being late, he asking a question and he's getting the response.
Then you can say that, at pawn black i,j minus two you just move pawn two steps further and where earlier the pawn was that place is blank.
So the project planning is done in a way that whenever the expert is available, you should execute things where you need him, okay .
So you have to choose that precondition accordingly.
In most cases, heuristic function will not give you exact value.
What what are the possible candidates and you'll just look at the them and check them which matches they they’ll just give you the Dendral, the output of the Dendral is small side of states which matches.
We need a rule of thumbs and that's precisely what we are going to discuss in the next module.
Support planning comes next.
okay , number of missionaries on either side is less than number of cannibals.
Who is playing it?
So that's that's the idea of branch and bound which is pretty simple.
And how can we state so?
Okay , there's one script which is a very simple script which I have provided in the handout of watching match.
Think of a moving car, an automated car, which is actually taking lot of inputs from a lot of sensors across, lot of cameras and all that, the data structure that you're going to use is pretty complex.
So, you can clearly state that is not relevant.
Then we will pick up the shortest city, the nearest city from that city and so on.
okay , so that is there is no panacea.
It's not found in other problem other problem solving methods that we have seen.
So, it is again varying .
It looks at the input and tries to figure out the the chemical compound structure.
The problems could be if you're using sparse neighbourhood we might be ignoring some important moves.
I have only two rules .
Not only that, the fox will have nothing to do with grain.
Hill climbing is simple.
So it will have higher heuristic value based on this information okay .
Total path between any two cities in a given graph is based on the number of cities that you have.
From B every other city than A and B and so on so forth.
So, that is important here and remember what I have told you the the leaf nodes you apply that static evaluation function okay and then it passed up, that happens in the unwinding part of the function.
Now what is this?
So, we are just planning.
You may be surprised the word average and and the value six point two, the value six point two clearly indicates what the value is while greater than average it's more like a fuzzy logic system and that's true.
And once a good designer has designed that script and that is used in representing a statement you can get immense value out of it.
That that's the point here.
And not much of a difference.
Second ‘Jay went to a friend's house near cricket stadium.
Implementation planning comes next.
But it is justified because we’re looking at an AI problem.
We have looked at two trivial problems in the previous module.
But important thing is while you come back you also have to think about prerequisites.
We will be looking at that algorithm in the next module.
Here the MOPs are a little more dynamic.
If the script writer has actually provided typical scenes, which can indicate, why one can get angry?
We’ll jump to ten and we got a solution, Okay .
If one of them is win, what will that person do?
Now this is an example of a fleeting script mentioned.
Now how that is changed?
When mental information is being transferred, MTRANS is used and we'll see some examples about how to how to use this form.
A farmer is on the left hand side he cannot be on the right hand side, okay , where A belongs to obviously farmer or not farmer B, belongs to fox not fox, and so on so forth.
With that, we’ll come to an end of this particular module.
How?
If you don’t have from this particular state there are no rules possible you can’t go further is a dead end.
So, that's why you can see that that relation is shown between fast and PTRANS .
So, winding phase happens before you make the recursive call okay if you read any recursive algorithms you've taken up any programming course, you probably know what I am talking about.
So, we we’ll we’ll talk about that action previous to the state.
A bat and and this this process of transformation, bat depends on this thing actually.
And both of them are used in practice.
and that is there in fact it is it is part of the script.
Specific decisions like whether I'll be using rule based expert system or whether I'm going to use fuzzy system or whatever will be decided here.
Second, a clear indication of what start and end states and what are the valid states.
Now, you can see that the script contains somebody called P now, we don't know who this P is, P is basically a placeholder.
If you have a move which can check the opponent’s king, it is better.
We are not going to address that right now.
So, that's why that arrow is is targeting the double arrow, okay between the actor and the act.
Okay Looking at picking keeping that thing in mind let us look at this.
Solution space are space, exploration is little complex.
Let us look at the first three representation.
Or or ‘Ram is in love’ does not indicate what's the object of love, whom he loves.
it is quite possible that you you get children all of them having lesser value than the parent and you can’t move forward, that is steepest ascent that is the local maxima problem.
Now, we move to L three one and R zero two.
Some presentations are complex compared with others.
So, so it could do it because the chess playing programs use heuristics based on the way the Garry Kasparov used to play chess.
Well, that is an additional prop that you will have and not others.
We’ll end this module.
that's what it is.
Have we solved everything?
And that’s why it is called feed forward network.
Same.
The heuristic search module, heuristic search method is a method, which is not blind like BFS, DFS and generate and test.
It’s not going to help me much.
If we would like to reach to our goal state, the most important thing is that we are moving and if we’re not moving we'll not be reaching there.
So we’ll explore one .
The sequence of events following in a default way obviously they are scenes and these are the most important things.
Anyway, we are not going to discuss that thing right now.
Now the ants will again start travelling from the very node.
So you can even take that case the first node, second node, third node, fourth node, the last node then the node itself.
The functioning of MiniMax again is like what I have talked about.
And the reuse reusability idea was also built in.
But then, there is a limit also.
And one actually can decide a better representation if we pay a little attention to it, one can write better the rules and the state space in a better way.
Let us begin talking about GA .
Similarly, if you have one cell occupied and next two are empty is a good state to have compared to a cell where the the the other cells are occupied.
We want all missionaries to move from left side to right side, okay .
what if I have a case of only twenty five twenty six cities?
Now there are two things you have for example, there are states one two three four and when you you go to a state you will find the state, remember missionary cannibal there are some states which are not acceptable.
The player starts from some state ok Here in this state, it has B,C,D, E and further and further when we stop, whatever those leaf node values are, static evaluation function is applied and calculated.
The advantage of this method does not demand the amount of memory that the the BFS demands and that’s why this is adopted by many programming languages.
What does that mean?
Now the longer path for example, in ten seconds this ant make five trips, this ant make four trips.
If no city left return back, but otherwise return back with the length and if and then check the length.
And you have to continuously meet and learn from expert in this particular case duration.
How do you find out?
In case of being decreased for a good move this called valley descending.
Now, there are some challenges in this, Okay , and what are the challenges we’ll be looking at but the point is, when we encounter an indication of such scenario, we’ll not only enter the information contained in that statement but contained or assumption that the complete scenario has taken place, we’ll insert everything else Okay .
Now, if you if you ask a chess player given a board position, two board positions which one is better, he would say, this is better or that is better.
Now that adds dynamism to this calculation of SEF .
In fact, TSP what you want to get is the same node back.
You can see now H appears in child one. Now corresponding element, Okay you can see.
So I'm attending my eyes to the match, Okay .
And using that we’ll have a far better estimates of the next move that we are going to take.
So, given an option, opponent will obviously pair.
The first layer and you can say W one prefixes always, okay .
Minus ten to ten is what we have already used.
Okay , problem in our case, the problem is pretty trivial.
But many people believe that it is GA is not part of AI , it is part of soft computing.
So, that is to be so this process is to be continuously repeated for all such paths.
So, this two headers are in possible to be used here and the automated cook can actually decide that Jay does not require the dinner now.
But is an interesting idea and probably a lot of others have used that idea and we are going to stress that idea.
Okay .
If it is not a leaf node, the function proceed further.
Let us go for a second ply and see what difference does it make.
Can we move?
Obviously, two abilities of deer can save.
Something similar you probably have done if you are science student and have tried to find out ions of a given given chemical compound.
There are people involved like waiters and cashiers and and others who serve, hotel manager is the person who take orders and so on so forth.
One way to solve this problem is to have a database of some sort indicating all restaurants of Ahmedabad.
You in frames also you have attributes and their values and and there are some default values which are assumed and and so on so forth.
Now they are explicitly mentioned.
Big problem.
The problem is most of the AI program problem is that they're very, very hard to characterize.
So when we take a move, we come to the next level and again the opponent plays and we get a situation.
okay This is how it is done?
So that's the first requirement.
And probably you can also conclude that Jay is not all that great cricket lover like other Indians.
How it is done?
It’s a double arrow which which is darkened, and it says that height greater than average and you can see the representation - Height and there is a bracket in which you say greater than average.
This is the other example.
sneeze The other one is called EXPEL, forcefully throw out something, for example, when I'm crying, the the tears EXPEL out of my eyes and one more called SPEAK, generate a sound, Okay .
So, that is the issue.
So, even if the prototype is discarded, there is still something positive and very, very important point is that even when you develop a prototype, simplest of prototypes or very, very complex prototype, the most important thing that you encourage people to feedback give feedback and give their suggestion because it's very, very easy to change the prototype is extremely hard to change the final product, okay .
In fact, we've already solved laugh the problem.
So it it’s very important that you provide right set of samples, right set of images.
Remember that plausible move generator is is based on a given game. okay .
Roles, the people who are involved like person who wants to watch the match or booking clerk and security person who show you in and ticket checker who is there.
Second, if this suppose, if you know how to write this function, how you put this function to use.
And it it it get the values on in the slots the attributes and and it can reason.
Something which is not there in the start state but in the end state should be added and actions should do this okay .
Something which has not changed for long, change it and see if you can reach to some solution, okay .
So, I have twenty six in in that case I need outputs, total twenty six outputs.
It is a cycle, Okay .
The only draw drawback of this system is that it it takes more time and more memory , obviously because it it it starts all over again every time.
So, if some script contains something which is possible to be reused, the MOP can do that.
okay .
In fact, the conceptual roles does do you may not find that thing in in in the the statement sometimes but it is derived out of that.
Now state space is a little clumsy in the sense that we we write a lot of like L A B C D.
D is next, so we are copying next D here. Okay .
You can see that ‘Sachin flew to LA.’
So, that is deleted.
One characteristic is highest value of win and least value of using losing.
But, eventually what we get when we use heuristic is is the estimate of how far we are from the goal node.
Okay For a complete binary tree I’ve already talked about number of node is almost double themselves at every level.
So, there is a weight between X zero and H one.
Lot of researchers were interested in learning about this and they have found very, very simple method that they are using for doing this, which is basically implemented in computer program and it can actually used to solve many search algorithms.
We are not going to discuss about them.
Because it as salesman will have to come back to that city.
So, this is called branch and bound, this is some simple method.
Why it is so?
We might end up being on on top of local minima.
So, that is what is being done here.
But please understand that this is not the limitation of CD .
Sometimes the the moves are known as or written as Production rules.
These are just examples of showing state with more heuristic value and less.
So, and what if some other ant has travelled some other path?
And the most complex thing is that when there are multiple rules possible, there are not one, two, three, four rules are possible, which one should I choose?
So the time is always our biggest constraint, exactly like chess.
Now very simple heuristic can be used here.
Why it is called you can see why it is called square.
Now it is actually possible to have around twenty different states.
If it is not what you have to do is to select some out of the complete set.
The chromosome contains genetic map of individual in form of a DNAs, okay .
So this one ply search is not very good.
It’s basically a cumulative value which is made up of multiple components and we’ll be that is also something that we will be looking at.
And the beauty is that once it is done, so, it becomes independent The language is also becomes becoming independent of the words used to represent that concept.
The first thing, for an input, for example, I I am taking a very simple case of recognizing an image.
The selection process only chooses better candidates based on the fitness value. okay .
The same thing is happening here.
If I also want lower and upper case it is sixty two total.
And how it is done?
Guided search methods use heuristics.
C on top of D is deleted.
I'm not going to play C, what's the point?
Because chess is much more structured structured than many other cases, many other games, even table tennis.
Now interestingly there is one action, we are putting A on table.
M plus C can be one, so one person can row the boat or M plus C can be two.
But the Sigma is basically summing up everything that comes in.
There was a game and there was a system called Bstar which was designed by a chess player as well as a computer scientist and he decided that I'll explore till I get some kind of questions, some kind of stability in in in the system.
And we have already seen that it is possible to learn from the domain which moves are better than others.
It it is not.
What will be the terminating criteria for the we we already seen that the time obviously is one.
You’re you're doing nothing you won't achieve anything out of but playing at the corner which is shown in B, we have two possible options.
Like when you say that ‘When I I went to watch a match’, which basically represents many things into one. How that is done, we’ll we’ll we’ll be looking at in scripts the next module.
Now, later on when the speaker utters something else, which which prohibits one of the branches, other two branches can still be explored.
We have also seen some of the advantages are as well as the shortcomings of CD .
In this case, a chromosome is a string, simple.okay .
So, this is the other example which neural network program can solve.
Not only that, there's one more thing.
One is farmer, two is fox, four is chicken and eight is grain.
You can see that, and it's called direction case.
And as I said, the algorithms are not fool-proof, the algorithm may not correctly classify.
Now, we are going to study in little more detail.
I We have named it as Unguided Search Methods.
So, when I say that Irfan is Irfan height Irfan is tall.
Think of it.
This is one way of representing.
We are not talking about domain knowledge, we are not talking about anything, we are just talking about resemblance of the intermediate state with the final state and the start state.
And remember, in our previous example that we took, M value is twenty-two.
Okay We have also seen how you decide number of input, output and hidden units.
Guided Search Methods actually use heuristics where you can you can say that this move is better than the other , or some some estimate about how good or bad a particular move is. deep breath
Okay , so that's the that's the saving that you will have okay . Obviously you're paying the price but
And if you start taking the other path A to B and D, it's already crossing two fifty and you you won’t go further.
They see if the the fingerprint is curved or square or broken or things like that.
So somehow BDC is used.
Depth Bound Depth-first search is, there is some limit you decide.
For example, this thing Mahesh hurt Jayesh by throwing stones.
No difference okay .
It's impossible because you don't have measuring device.
GA is about searching in solution space.
So you can conclude that his favorite team has won.
If it is not, I’ll go to the first step.
One, you pick up the first state, second state, third state start applying rules and go ahead.
Based on this we can draw a search graph or tree like shown in the next slide.
We, opponent. We, opponent.
You just travel first path record minimum, consider that as a minimum path, travel next path if it is more than minimum just terminate it from there and skip all branches and so on, okay and this branch and bound is great, if you have chosen somehow has some heuristic which can help you choose shorter paths before you'll be able to gain a lot out of this, okay .
One you travel further and say that because he wanted to know who has come to bat Okay who is going to come to bat.
And if you if you can somehow manage that it becomes easier for us to choose moves which are better and complete the search process in real time.
We’ll also look at two other methods of search called branch and bound and refinement search in in this particular module.
And mathematically representing this part is also possible.
Why?
The best is obviously C, so you would choose to play the second.
Sometimes a small statement will require two to three pages, full of conceptualizations.
So you can't conclude everything. So this is again an example of the power of script.
First, they guide the developer in learning about what's the system, what exactly is the system, what is going to come in, what’s going to be…So, for example, the forms which which we call in conventional system, they are called forms.
So I I'm taking fox but you can easily take grain on the other side.
Chess, is very structured compared to others and seemingly complicated problem but comparatively more structured so people have solved that problem and there are many other problems which are not possible to be solved for example, rating an essay.
What is solution?
So, point is such things depends on context.
What you need?
So that's quite similar.
The first prerequisite is a it works In fact back propagation is used in many forms in many places .
I I may say that height equal to or or I say height in the bracket six point two.
Similar example is some surveillance case, okay .
Number of components as I said large number of companies is not very good.
Okay , so that is again, very, very important.
Bit number one is farmer, bit number two is fox, bit number three is chicken, bit number four is grain.
So, like that when you encounter a statement where you can replace that placeholder, it is it is done that way.
So, I have that option.
Now it's very interesting how the values is is passed in this case because this is a minimizing level the last level the sixth level is minimizing level.
So, there are two components involved.
Image of some other object is provided and it says it is the friend.
So total is basically collected from all ants travelled on that path and those ants which have not travelled on that path they’ll not contribute, okay .
So what should I choose?
Eventually you will find that you will have all missionaries and cannibals on the right hand side.
So okay , so that's the point.
Now, the first node that we generate is minus one , which is obviously not as good.
so you you change things in a way when you you have two strings, two parents when they meet, you you do not get a string with similar characteristic,
‘Do’ may come later.
Similarly, the statement here is converted to some basic collection of some basic primitives.
Recognizing somebody is one example.
Okay , now, the complete sequence of moves.
okay There are three arguments passed to the algorithm, the current player the depth value and the heuristic of players identity.
And you will have to do it again, second epoch, third epoch.
Instead of zero, we accept point one, instead of one, we accept point nine, just because of this problem.
Everything on the right hand side.
And exactly you can see on the slide, one solution which begins from eight zero zero.
Well, that's what I said in the beginning that you can use CD as an interlingua.
In some cases, yes, okay .
That is the beginning part of the conceptualization and then normal user is also invoked.
Let me know, L two zero R one three and B L.
The essence is picked up and used.
So, I'm I'm not or for example, there are twenty moves and Ill just choose two.
Please also understand that this relevant part has nothing to do with heuristics.
You can see that the PPT talks about the obstacle and the ants are finding.
We have we say that L A B C D, e R E F G H okay and then say A plus E is equal to one.
Not only that, formalization also talks about checkpoints and deadlines and it will give you a timeline then, in two months’ time, this is part is to be done, next two months, this is to be done and so on, so forth.
Okay .
This is what we want.
So, we we do late binding.
So, that can generalize.
We meet people and decide this is a good person and this is a bad person, this is not so nice person and so on and so forth.
Pick up the start node and make it current.
Goal stack planning is again a very simple way of planning.
But that is not happening here.
Okay .
The opponent.
Nearest neighbor was only for TSP .
We move on to the state called three five zero where we are applying rule number nine and so on .
’ Now, that is used as an instrument for the other conceptualizations to take place.
Now, those weights every remember, every input unit is connected to every output unit.
Now, when I have explored only first ply, B looked promising.
And finally, we'll write this and why this is written the the lower part of on this is complete goal description.
Now, here k again is a layer which I was talking about.
okay , Many a times expert will not be able to tell the KE that I'm I’m solving this problem this way.
Mahesh throws a stone and that is an object to to hurt Jayesh.
So, in fact, you may see that why the hidden unit is provided?
For example, I'm I'm I’m at a typical place in in in eight, zero eight, five, three gallon water jug problem.
It just gives you an estimate, Okay and there are some mathematical ways of judging how estimate is near to the correct value and so on, so forth.
Mahesh hurting Jayesh and second Mahesh is also throwing a stone.
So this is the solutions search.
That is exactly what's happening here and it is in PPT is it is bold-faced.
In this particular module, we have seen branch and bound, we have looked at in the In fact, we began with ant colony optimization and we looked at how ant find the food source and then how one can mimic a computer program to do the same.
And all four of the prerequisites must match , okay .
For example, here you get a slanting line like this and this and a horizontal line, you can call it A, irrespective of which picture which pixel is it illuminates and which pixel it doesn't.
We have three units.
It contain two things, one is path, which is basically a string talking about more X and Y than Z and so on.
So, the next slide talks about this process in a little more detail.
For example, pick up a word called ‘Love’.
They they pick up random solutions in the beginning.
So, second one is little better and it is not going to lead us to draw, lose if you if you see that, that thing, the second move, there's no chance that we'll get a lose okay .
If A is Fr farmer is on that side.
If you have seen the the algorithm cleverly, you you would see that the the value that we return is is also written in negative form.
Suppose if there are two ants, one travels here, the other travel through a longer path and both of them have found their the same food source.
What the other example we have shown on the the slide the.. how to build a robot which can do all household chores?
The other method that we’ve seen is called best first search.
For square it is not, okay .
But then here are exam…you already have the paths ready.
Can should I explore J?
The first process - Selection.
Done.
So that path will no longer, not look attractive if the ant has not found the food source.
Theres no technical reason okay .
Okay , we're not talking about because here in in the simplest representation, we have not talked about fellow spectators, we have not talked about umpires, we have not talked about assuming a cricket match, we have not talked about the ball boys and all that.
So, they are related by a single single sided because the dependency is only on one direction and there is an indicator O which indicates that is an object for this particular action.
And the other one is described an action aider.
That person is six point two inches tall or height greater than average is example of is taller than an average cricket player.
That information is directly copied in and you don't even require expert’s help there because that is readily available, you just have to convert that thing to digital form.
Rajan wanted it.
You've seen number of variables and number of symbols that one can use and and or and so on so forth.
We have talked about this in past.
‘Jay went to watch an ODI, he was late, when he occupied his seat, asked his fellow spectator who won the toss?
There is no complexity here actually.
ok the like hill climbing or simulated annealing or something similar.
How bike and that PTRANS is related okay , PROPEL, sorry is related.
It it collects those big bunch of structures, match and that matching is done by something else.
If you use branch and bound we’ll try travelling in this direction continuously for a quite large period and that's why it takes it will take more time in converging.
So, if you want to write a general purpose problem solver for chess it’s very, very hard it’s almost impossible.
The other one is losing and a third one is a draw.
Whether I get my salary right or I don't get it right.
But, the one which I'm talking about backpropagation neural network the BPNN which is the most used algorithm requires the network to be complete.
What we are going to talk about is preliminary, a few basic things about neural networks.
This state actually converts the formalized content into the code that is the minimum thing that you do in this phase and it’s very cruc…crucial part is KE and developer communication.
Neuron is very tiny thing and it uses electrochemical reactions, okay , the the signaling process to send and receive.
So that's an example of an an invalid move.
Now, we have already seen Sachin went to LA.
So that’s that's what I’m doing in fact.
Now why should I be not exploring the next one?
Some algorithms, which we are going to study later requires this function to be continuous. Okay , so we have sigmoid function is to be used.
So, that's the case here.
Object bat.
But you can see that I I I'm exploring J.
Now the other string contains something A, D, E, F and now it has some cities which are already occurring here.
Okay , sometimes you you will want to specify the time, for example, Milkha Singh ran yesterday, then that arrow will have that information, so that is sometimes called T, T represent time and there are some action aiders, for example, when you say Milkha Singh ran yesterday, that yesterday is called action aider.
For example, one typical example I could quote from Mahabharat is Purochan endangered Pandavas.
We get three and two.
And, that’s why it is represented in in a little darker fashion.
You can see the right hand side we have the mapping.
I was talking about those twenty then pick up five; so these twenty strings that you pickup in the beginning is called a solution set or is called population. okay .
The lowermost part is called unwinding phase.
See the prerequisites there are four prerequisites in this state space representation.
Now, as I say I have five, so it will pick up one and five or pickup two and three and pick up one and four and so on.
So, it moves. The ownership is moved from Sachin to Sarfaraz okay .
What is a learning?
Simple, you cut some part of the string and paste some part elsewhere and the other one you apply fitness function to the string finding out how good or fit this particular string is.
Before that calling, every every statement that is a key booted in this particular function will be executed before that call is.
That means this path is more attractive.
But the problem is, I have to decide number of missionaries and cannibals, which I did .
And And like the previous case we have four which has two and three and you you cannot go because it’s it’s worse.
Now how can I remove all that?
You have all four of them on one side and in the initial state, all four of them on the right side in the final state.
So it begins with A.
where we we can see that even even a trivial problem like travelling salesman result into a serious combinatorial explosion.
Farmer, fox, chicken and grain on the left-hand side, nothing on the right hand side.
The next level is thirty five into thirty five into thirty five minus whatever you’ve explored so far.
Because, you're going there, now you stop and now you're returning back.
If dead end, we’ll try the right child and again left.
For example, for a given node I have twenty children,
How can I have it? Fine!
And again, we'll see a few examples of complex statements, how those complex statements can be represented using multiple primitives together okay .
It is it is like this, okay it is basically a discrete function, for all negative values it is zero , for all positive values it is plus one.
If you don't do that,it will be eaten up.
But simple.
So but we’re doing it, Okay so we’re we’re picking up, we’re we’re taking that as correct and we’re going forward.
Additionally, we also seen the SEF being a a composite structure it contains it’s basically a weighted value okay multiple components multiplied by their respective weights.
In short you can use moves to move around in state space and reach to the solution.
There is no ISA relationship.
The subscript order is the designer’s choice, there is no fixed rule.
So, that is very good actually.
The idea is when when you say that I had five hundred rupees, I went to Jungle Book and had my dinner.
Okay Let us begin with the introduction of something called heuristic function.
How number of inputs and output unit and the hidden unit are decided?
Anyway, these are not all are important things, just to make sure you understand what we are talking about.
So, the inputs flow in the forward direction and whenever the input flows, the output layer checks whether the output is right or wrong.
In fact I just said that for twenty employees, each of the employees I I have fifty images.
The syntactic rules okay , the second one talks about the the relation between an actor and the attribute of the actor or PP and PA , okay .
So, point is the roles even viewing a match role would change, Okay .
We don't really know, in fact.
Same.
The idea of using simple systems and combining them, the the power is quite unique.
But not in all cases.
You’re paying you probably have dined, Okay .
And after implementation planning, obviously the last phase implementation starts.
What is the disadvantage?
Okay , We'll talk about some of them in in due course. And set of rules.
Now you can see that the parent one B, G and A there are B, G and A, they are not to be copied into the child.
For example, the other example Jay went to Epicurean which is basically a name of a restaurant which is there in Ahmedabad with his colleagues of his of the office.
A recursive function is a function, where a call to itself is made somewhere in between, so whatever you've done before is called winding phase and the next phase is the recursive call to that function.
So, if you're sitting with an expert, you’ll have to learn all that because the rules are going to come in form of that jargon and you’ll have to convert that thing into the knowledge base.
Look at the the sigmoid function you will be able to see.
The conceptualization, remember I had said in the previous module, the conceptualization is quite similar to the analysis in conventional system design process.
The chicken and the farmer, both of them can go on the right side and the job is done.
You may not repeat, but if you do if you are not repeating what you are supposed to do is to remember the entire tree.
So it's good that you explore multiple nodes.
Now, seriously ill is minus nine and so on and so forth.
Now, interestingly, when you start doing it this way, there can be three different types of outputs.
So that’s the problem withs this method.
I’m not doing it blindly and that’s why this is called guided search and not blind search or unguided search.
There are three basic operations.
Remember the tour cost for example, in this case, one ABCD is so far two twenty plus two fifty plus one fifty that is six twenty.
So, validate the prototype comes next.
So, and sometimes an additional value is provided.
Maintenance and extension is also part of this part, but the maintenance is not only maintaining the expert system, but continuously improving it for quite some time.
So if if all possible cases are explored together, if one of if the later, he uttered some word which prohibits one of the translations, the other translations can still be tried.
You can see that ‘R’ okay and other thing also we have seen.
It is due to in the the human and other spaces, it is basically due to external influences like radiation.
From this five generate twenty, throw this five, out of this twenty again pick up up five, throw rest so and so forth.
So, everybody is roped in now and we have a bigger team in this particular phase.
When it is omitted it is the default value is is Milkha Singh himself.
The rule number fourteen is one of the simplest.
Not only that, we have many heuristics possible, we have already talked about heuristics.
So, we'll be talking about them.
And you pick up first five and so on.
Now you are surprised the earlier example we had twelve moves.
Maybe farmer.
So, to code program robots, one needs to use this kind of logic.
It's an excellent idea in fact.
5,3,0 one output is 3,5,0 and 5,0,3 both of them are already explored so we’ll not look at them. The rest of the tree is just explored the same way.
Now, in in look at the weights okay .
You try to explore all possible states and you become more conscious about In a way you're applying dense neighbourhood function even when the situation becomes critical.
Now the most important part, we would like to solve travelling salesman problem using GA .
Product release is also planned.
When we write general rules , the problem is that there is there has to be something.
Okay .
So, you should try to mitigate the the consequences if the decision is wrong and how you do that is also to be part of this thing.
The issue is that in case of G, if in in most handwritten case recognition, you will not find that horizontal line.
Okay , many a times we look at things and classify them.
Okay .
For example, you you doing hill climbing and you stuck there.
How you assume?
So many paths are avoided using this branch and bound.
One is called the Ontological memory which, remember this was a problem with the the CD as well as script.
Unwinding part on the contrary is very important here because that happens in in in the reverse order.
So, all three of them are shown on the screen and as all three possible outcomes that we have.
How will you do that?
We’d like to have a better heuristic value so we’ll not move further.
This is just one way of doing it.
And when information is missing, like ‘Sachin flew to LA’ and all that, where where where the information is not complete.
Two choices and if I play B, I'm guaranteed to get minus three okay? .
So, these are also points that one must learn but it is very interesting how back propagation manages it.
PDDL as I said is used for this purpose.
Now there is a single word ‘ate’.
Now, there are two things happening.
So, in branch and bound however good it is, it does not have any sense of direction in true sense.
Learning faster is not always advisable.
But again theoretically if you want a proof that the problem is given will surely solve, that is not possible.
So is it kind of a dead end or or loss, Okay , a failure.
So it is right.
Thank you!
We’ll be discussing about the back-propagation algorithm that we mentioned in the previous module.
They actually begins with solution search method.
Before we embark on the real algorithm, there's one more word which is commonly used in the literature called W and B.
It is possible to choose a function which produces less number of nodes which is called Sparse neighbourhood function or I can have more number of nodes which is called Dense neighbourhood function.
It is not applied elsewhere.
Current player actually is either we or the opponent.
You may take up some other course on object oriented programming to understand what is the usefulness and importance of it.
That means that now we have M one minus M missionaries on left side, C one minus C missionaries on the left hand side, that must fulfill this condition.
okay.
you get a string with very, very different characteristic,
If the first player has played something the second player will not be in a position to use that.
What does that mean?
Unguided Search Methods means, we don't use heuristics , but we use simple methods to search from the initial state.
You have to decide how knowledge base is going to process the queries of the users.
So, is either on the left hand side or the right hand side.
So, this is an example of a relevant progression.
For missionary cannibal reconstructive search method is a little better because it’s easier.
But you can see that there are two indicators, two headers.
So we like to increase that , in the other this thing we will like to reduce total amount of distance covered.
When you do something in your mind, conceive an idea or or build something within your mind, it is called MBUILD , that is represented by a primitive called MBUILD .
And what we get at the end, you can see that I get two different answers.
So out of ten if I if I can only change two.
In GA , we know that the solutions are broken apart and reconnected and find best solutions.
So, based on this, we’ll decide number of output units.
Z is amount of milk in the three gallon jug.
That’s why the word optimization appears in this case and also it’s very interesting that the ants can also rediscover the short path the shortest path, how they do it?
The place where I hang my keys is the other.
Now you can look at this and see if placing C on the table whether it is nearer to start state placing C on the table is added while you move back.
But again, for the classification also that is a generate and test.
Okay , the method itself is called Crossover.
Better offspring offspring have more chances of survival and then next generation is genetically better. Okay
It is possible that you miss an optimum par, you miss a solution altogether.
how many?
It is impossible.
So, let us see what we can do.
I’ll not reach to solution after this, Okay .
So, these are examples.
See, we’re not doing exploring it like hill climbing, Okay .
So and there is something called picture aiders which which talks about the attributes of the object.
You have to continue doing it unless and until you get the final result.
All all these statements basically mean the same.
This one.
okay , the genetic footprint of anybody is called a genome.
Now, that is going to be troublesome.
Lot of abnormal cases might be there because every other system says that it is malaria, but the patient has typhoid.
okay .
Second, we’ll only be taking one move.
Minus ten.
Okay but then there is one more thing > Okay .
One important aspect of the process is moving from the initial state to the final state.
For example, when you find a statement called Jay want went to watch a match.
Now, once you say that Milkha Singh ran, it is done, but when you say Milkha Singh ran in Pakistan, that additional is location.
He answered, India has won the toss and invited South Africa to bat.
There is something else called Ordinal Representation.
Because start says the first state, zero is the depth and zero is the player who is playing.
One more primitive is called INGEST, taking something from outside.
NodeInfo object contains these two value and NodeInfo contains one is path the other is value.
We can say that H one equal to why it is one, because X zero is always one, into W one zero one.
Irrespective of what is the value of the other one. Other one maybe ten, that is better, but is always five or more.
Obviously, I want to identify not only A but if suppose if I'm interested in finding out all uppercase letters.
You you shouldn't have very large number of components because it’s going to reduce the the search time.
We will continue picking up nearest cities and eventually we will get the the the complete list of cities.
Attribute with an actor is also possible to be used.
If KE might look at different alternatives and decide the best one and it is quite possible that KE might probably have not understood what expert has said.
You’ll have to search for final state and that’s precisely is the is the important part of this particular module.
You will try to actually explore more number of nodes.
Because the the heuristic function value in this case is decreasing and not increasing.
So, action adds something.
but in a way we are not going to discuss that further in this particular module.
At no point of time the missionary should be less, okay .
I can move to six,zero,two.
So, that D appears on that three-prong structure that indicates direction and it is also when there is a direction, there is a source and there is a destination.
Well, some authors even get even use real values as well.
It just does not depend on that time.
Here is the description.
Then min, then max, then min, then max and so on.
When we reach to the the sixth ply, our time gets over.
So that is represented in the handout, you can see that there is a double arrow between I and MTRANS which indicates double dependency.
And they are called conceptual categories, this PP picture producer, PA picture aiders and ACT and location and time and all that together are called conceptual categories.
Now, if I want to place A on top of Y X on top of Y, A on top of B, there are two things required, the preconditions both of them must be free which is shown in the preconditions tag of the action description.
So, you decides about knowledge representation system.
But the rest as I have said you can use that heuristic to find out the path which is there.
Now how will I how will you write that problem? I'm not asking for a solution. How will you characterize the problem? It's not that easy.
Because things are decided, things are processed and not only that, they they also require to change more frequently than conventional systems.
Every time you do it okay , so that is what MiniMax algorithm is.
Now, again you will come across the same dilemma that you had before.
The remaining part talks about a very simple improvement that that we can make.
There are parallel scenes, there are alternate scenes.
what are the classes involved?
When this particular user is to be blocked?
Roles are people who are involved in the script and this is a general assumption and that might change.
You may get the child two in a similar fashion and this is how the order crossover works.
For example, when you see, the information is coming from eyes, when you hear, the information is coming from ears, when you touch and feel, the information coming from the other senses and so on so forth.
So that additional Pakistan will have a link and that link will indicate LOC, that means that link describes the location where this particular action has happened.
There are in fact it's there in the center diagonal lines, two diagonal lines, two horizontal and vertical line the middle column, the middle row and both diagonal lines are possible for you to cover in this case.
So, two conditions: A dot addition’s intersection GS must be a non -empty set and A dot deletion intersection GS must be an empty set.
Now in this particular case this maybe the best tour, if this gives me and how do you decide?
And we have already seen that AI programs don't have AI problems don't have the algorithms , AI solutions don't have the algorithms, so you you just don't have a a a clear cut method to begin from initial state to reach to the final state.
It can also be used as inter lingua actually, so if if you convert an English statement into a CD form, that CD form can be converted to any other language.
Okay , something which can which can lead to solution.Consider okay .
If I explore it just one level in chess, I'll have to apply to thirty-five states.
The first one selects the best members of the population, remember I was talking about five out of twenty.
Okay , B plus F is two.
Because when you talk about anything, it depends on context.
Probably you will have be able to reason with and get those values filled in.
You hear the record and organize the knowledge structure.
And validation normally is done by the designing expert.
E F G H is also farmer, fox, chicken, grain but then some other values.
And exactly opposite is regression.
For example, genes will decide the color of the skin and the the type of teeth and the color of eyes and so and so forth.
You don't have that knowledge stored in expert’s mind or KE’s mind that is to be verbalized, and this is the the other part.
Not only that, the expert also learns something out of it.
So, they the the biggest advantage of using ant colony optimization is that it is possible to rediscover the shortest path, if there is a problem.
But we cannot just arbitrarily add or remove components, we’ll have to apply actions and we cannot even apply actions arbitrarily, we’ll have to make sure that the prerequisites for that action must exist and if it is not there we have to generate that state with a precondition for which we’ll have to apply some other action.
We’ll soon see.
So that's what this first representation do.
And C and F as I said that they are directly copied because there is they are not part of the map.
You can't move forward.
So Jungle Book is is a restaurant.
When I tell you that I went to watch a match, you you assume a lot of things.
if you taken a path, you can't come back.
You can see that there is a threat from knight to the king.
Well when we reach to an unreachable or unaccepted.
okay So, that is how this thing processes, because this recursive function there are three different components, winding, call and unwinding.
That means there is a black pawn at position i and j and j equal to seven.
We have no option.
Second is quite also.
So, the point is, this ant colony optimization method is based on these two simple parameters, whether the path is recent or whether this path is travelled by multiple agents.
Now there are two alternatives and and remember I'm not looking at the lower most level now.
okay , when you talk about a soldier fit, does not and fit when you say plus eight, he is really fit.
So, that's what we write.
The fourth step is collection of nodes and whatever we have discussed and we have also studied how we decide the best value and why that best value is good.
So this alpha and beta cut-offs are also applied to MiniMax in most cases which improves the the algorithm further.
If the opponent makes a mistake, I may even get five.
This is the first other search method that we are going to see.
So you can sacrifice your queen to kill that pawn in in in some cases.
Now, if you encounter this statement, you you also expect a lot of additional things.
A parent maybe a children, to a children and so on, so forth.
So, it learns faster.
okay , so every time we'll do this process.
So I I looked at both innings, I'm happy if my team has won, I'm not happy if my team has lost and so on so forth.
Now, that second level of tree.
Quite similar to the plan space planning which we have talked about long back.
Though we have used words in English, basically, they are they are placeholders, okay .
I may say that I'll only change two of the states.
Here the conceptualization process actually starts.
I just wanted to highlight the negation.
One thing you probably think that more number of components,more precise your measurement and better it is.
You can see 8-0-0, 5-0-3, 0-5-3, 3-5-0, 8-0-0.
The complexity lies in the moves.
In this case, we don’t do it.
Now, if you look at that figure, it is the initial position when j is seven, indicates that it is the initial position of that black piece.
How a output unit learns to remain active and for example is provided to it.
Remember we will have to have set of better solutions and combines their parents randomly and combine good elements of parents and so and so forth.
We may end up on a dead end because you explore only two and there are no both of them are dead ends, okay .
You can see that.
The heuristic value is just an estimate.
You just pour milk from here to here and here back , you won't get to a solution , but you won't come to an end as well.
Lot of people play a lot of different ways.
If you have two cannibals on the right hand side, you have to send two missionaries on the right hand side and so on so forth.
But then I would say, give me all positions of that. How many such matrices you will provide? Think of it.
Looking at the results, the candidate structures are are calculated and checked for a match, Okay .
And this change, for example, if you go out to have watch a cricket match and you buy a pavilion ticket, you probably will have an additional food coupon.
Because we are going to give very clear visibility to every stakeholder.
Okay , let us look at one important factor that was best first search.
So, that also is very, very important and technical nuances that you probably can use like taking direct data from IMD into medical system or storing data directly in the cloud.
How it is done, we’ll see later.
Only when those prerequisites are met, you can apply that rule, otherwise not.
What does that mean? You pour milk from eight gallon jug to five gallon jug and pour it back .
W is win,L is loss and D is draw.
But then nearest neighbor does not give you any guarantee for optimal solution.
So, that is that should have a higher heuristic value.
So, the longer the path, less the pheromone value.
B and C is exchange, D and C is exchange, E and D is exchange, F and E is exchange and F G and F is exchange.
So not answer those statements like ‘Jay went to the stadium, he bought a ticket’ and so on so forth.
It's very likely that the third ant will follow this path.
Now that’s little difficult to understand at the first shot but let me explain that in brief.
That probability does not remain the same.
One is four, which is same so we’ll not go for that.
So, what do you want to do is you just have to achieve B on top of A and A is on top of table, that's what we want only two things to be done.
The one more possibility is 0,5,3.
It generates optimal paths again when there is an obstacle placed and there are three good things about it.
Everybody is on the right hand side.
One of them is called simulated hill climbing for example.
It doesn't force it prematurely.
You will have to find out those areas and make sure that they are addressed and and the performance is improved to the extent that is acceptable at expert level.
So, every day there are five thousand applications coming in.
So, whether you're doing it well, if you're not doing it well, whether your plan contains managing uncertainties - these are crucial ingredients for making the system run for a longer period.
In fact, one of the programs Schank wrote was called SAM Okay , which can understand, reads like stories like this and and can reason from it, Okay .
So that is the next one, but if the total is less than three, you can pour everything here and this becomes completely empty .
It is quite possible in the script, some scenes are not executed at all.
Now the exit condition of one particular script and the entry condition of the other script, you will have to join them.
But technically there's no difference.
The the nucleus’ job is done by a function called the Sigma, okay .
Now state space says L A B C D and R E F G H.
The the different components which you want to solve and for every component it adds an action and once the complete stack is done, we’ll run that thing and see if it gets the goal and it is very, very important because it is quite possible that an action might have a side effect which undo what some other action previously done action is done, okay .
There's few there are few things which are worth pointing out.
For example, I want to have C on D and I say that place on top CD I would like to execute that but the precondition says that the C and D both must be free.
You can see that his representation is almost the same as we have seen before.
But then two important principals which I have already to talked about let me reiterate them.
Now why that is better?
We have also seen what are the what are the challenges in this.
When you you go to restaurant after ten-fifteen experience you you probably expect everything waiters and all that very, very clearly.
So, okay , once the tentative plan is ready, you can start with actual implementation.
SEF returns what?
And later stage you don't.
Not only that, you can even go ahead and pick up some other brands, some other node which is better than three, you can do it.
And the you can see the row the next one the row value.
You cannot change its size, because that’s the input, that’s the image that is coming in, you cannot change that.
And looking at the later statement, if it is found that he has really went go went to watch the match, you can insert those things later and not not right now.
Similarly, when you talk about run, you're transferring your your own self, throw, you have move or or catch, okay , you you are the recipient of that PTRANS movement, okay .
Explore the tree as long as you can get the static evolution function value, back the things up , till the topmost node, based on that pick up the best move from there on.
Thank you all.
But then might not give you exact answer may not be optimal, may not be as in some cases may not give you even good answers.okay .
The the beauty is that it stores information in distributed fashion and not a localized fashion like computer programs.
So what you can do is you can in the next cycle you can explore them before others and see how expensive they are in the next case and you can omit some of the branches, Okay .
Again we are not going to do that further here.
K also can be there in the beginning, okay .
So, the various senses the information is coming in and it is being sent to CP , okay .
As soon as the person completes the sentence, it is to be translated and and delivered to the participant.
We have only two rules and we have only few prerequisites so far.
Now you may be surprised why you are doing that.
Okay you can see that script it contains few things one is called entry condition.
Okay what's the difference?
In the beginning , will start with start state zero zero.
That's the issue.
Even in household today, robots have becoming pretty common today.
You said that I'm going to use NMR or I'm going to add fuzzy component in it, or I'll use certainty factors here.
So chicken is taken back, and then you pick up grain and take it on the other side.
okay So, heuristic value also is negated.
And as I said objective function is the same thing as heuristic.
In that case it is five hundred into five hundred inputs and so on so forth.
Second question that, what are the impacts of these decisions?
Now that is also simple but quite effective in some cases.
So we are not discussing the rest of them.
So, what people are going to input the reports, what people are going to see as an output, the key concepts involved in this process.
How you decide that this process is malicious?
Now we are writing the value of the variable.
We don't really know what the source is.
That is called planning, okay .
Now what is branch and bounds?
Ram killed Ravan.
So, that ‘with a friend’ is represented like this.
We begin with the exploration.
In a normal case when you say that ‘fit’, somebody who can walk two to three or ten, five five-six kilometers maximum, not more.
For example, he would say that when you decide, okay , what are the decision you made.
Now, let us look at the travelling salesman problem.
But, the point is though it looks expensive in the face of it, it is not so.
If all three consecutive states all three consecutive cells are occupied by opponent, it is minus ten.
When it finds something which is unusual, something which is not mentioned in the scene at all Okay , it can understand.
So it is and this search process maybe quite jittery that moves across different branches and so on, so forth.
It’s a nine into nine matrix.
It is also possible to indicate that there is a transition, there is something which is happening and here it it gets concluded, Okay .
So, that also it it is the negative value of threshold.
how do you do that?
When it reaches to the calling node, we'll have the complete path.
How it's state is chosen?
So, that is X one to X eighty-one information provided okay .
The child one is B, G, A child two is B, D, E and that is what we mean by mapping.
In this particular module, we are going to see simple , simplest of them called Unguided Search Methods .
okay , so but the point is heuristics usually help and we need heuristics.
We again do not have any measuring device with us.
The figure clearly indicates how it is moving because it’s moving in the direction of the arrow, okay .
We assume that it is A,Irrespective of the size or orientation or wherever it is.
We would like to add components which are not there in the start state they're in the end state.
Okay So, if you can do that, what is the advantage?
I I'll cut them at the same place, I I pick up this part and paste it here, pick up the first string path and paste it here. Okay .
For example, let let let us try to understand, if I take single point crossover is it going to work?
Can you try to understand what they are?
What he did, he wrote a an artificial intelligence program based on neural networks and when he could do it the advantage of that program is that could shortlist those five thousand resumes into just five hundred and expert’s work is reduced tenfold, okay .
What will happen is there are two paths available now.
That is not allowed.
In our case we pick up a range from minus ten to ten. Minus ten is losing plus ten is winning but then some other value indicates how promising that node is.
And and the events are connected to each other.
If you if you if you have a football match viewing then there is some difference.
Okay .
Okay and the final state is everything on the right hand side so it says L not Fr, not fx, not ch, not grain.
Think of representing a problem of rating an essay or rating a post using a state space and you learnt that it is not that easy.
So, here the symbols are explained the next slide.
DNA in turn contains genes, okay which basic building blocks.
You probably think that it is possible.
It also calculates the error coming back and so on, so forth.
So that is the problem with hill climbing.
That is called State Space two.
It says everybody is on the left hand side, nothing nobody is on the left hand side, everybody is on the right hand side.
We don't really know . Right now, we don't really know.
For example, throw also involves moving of body body part, okay , so that involves the other primitive, which we talk about later called ‘Move’, moving a body part.
Anyway, there are two two questions that you’d probably ask before we proceed further.
So when I get stability, the moves are not changing much, the state space is not changing much, I believe that is the is the right time to stop and I'll stop.
So what you do is, you just check for those impossibilities.
For example, after three years of service, you probably give one foreign trip with spouse to every employee or you have if you have two children, you pay the school fees for those two childrens and the other cost, you bear those costs and so on, so forth.
But in simulated annealing there is no temperature.
Now that node maybe maybe little bad that that node may may not be as good as it looks at the first shot.
In fact, the IBM people took three to four years to build this and they spent a lot of money on it rather than though it has beaten Gary Kasparov, I must say that is actually a testimony to that genius for which they have done so much hard work to beat him only three two.
So it is A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I and it is a little longer and littler different.
okay And that is important.
One more method is to pick up depth-first search, we only pick up one typical branch of the tree and explore it continuously and come to a dead end, we take up the next branch and so and so forth.
So, that always you need to have some optimum number of such components.
Single conceptual entity represents the event.
No , it is not that structured, it is very hard.
Okay , so sometimes some authors combine few rules together, sometimes some authors even use a general rule which which actually represent multiple rules together and so on so forth. So, you won't find the matching.
You see the example, minus five, four and zero four three.
So, there are some specific primitives, we’ll be looking at them basic building blocks, and those around those building blocks, the structures are generated and those structures are used to represent simplest things about the world.
Now the preconditions .
Now, let us look at this back propagation network.
okay The over function thus returns the structure okay So, node infrastructure which is very important for us .
okay you can't check all the permutations and combinations real time there's no panacea, there's nothing which solves all problems.
Expectation of a normal user and a new normal user expects you to sympathize if he's having a serious disease or something like that.
He can he can walk twenty kilometers without a problem.
So there are many other tours possible.
So, there's the other solution here is PAM and there are a few other attempts which are mentioned in the the knowledge representation and there are two description logic and the on the Web Ontology Language.
Right set of motivational strategies for employees.
But if you want to write a computer program probably you will have to represent that thing as as the state space which we talked about and do all this jugglery and also you'll have to in fact, here I have not talked about how to represent, how to write moves.
So, there is no destination shown here.
What we do is out of twenty we just apply fitness function like heuristic function, it is like top five or top six or whatever. okay .
to that algorithm decides.
There are a few other things.
and and it inherits from parents to children,
In fact, I have avoided using O Milkha Singh object okay and that that relationship I have not written here to indicate that sometimes you can even omit that.
You take the summation further and if the value is more, so will continue increasing it you will get a better value.
In fact, there is one more important type of learning which is left.
So, there is another point.
It It fails there and in case of best first search we don’t do it.
So if it is not working that fast it’s not going to be that useful, that that powerful.
For example, when I'm talking about bank and if the context is financial, you know that it’s a financial institute which lends money, allows me to have an account and then withdraw and deposit money and so on so forth.
Only farmer can row the boat.
The solution space ready, and you initialize the solution using a very simple thing.
Some authors describe the the layer in the beginning.
M plus L, two plus one, three, zero plus three, three.
I've already discussed this.
For example, an example is given in the handout I'm I’m just quoting that example.
So if we back it one more level up what will happen?
Simplicity is one, readability is the other.
If you use sparse what you can do is you can just replace it by the remaining.
A is what?
in the beginning you may prefer that, yes it it it it is five, it is good, so we should.
So it begins with null.
What should it be?
Images of the friend that we would like to recognize and some other images, with only two things.
So conceptualization and putting it into a proper form which experts can also view and once the expert views it, he will be able to validate that.
There is a single knowledge which is to be converted into all this.
Sometimes obviously the best of the old generation strings are cloned into the new one, those who have or having better fitness values to make sure that you get a better offspring in the next generation.
While while we read something, when we come across something that we don't understand, probably after reading few more passages, we’ll we’ll be able to get that thing right.
We know that these many possible, so that many nodes. Okay .
What does they do?
Now this is basically moving to that state with the probability P because if you use a good heuristic function, good random number generator between zero and one it is equally probable each number is equally probable.
Okay , we in fact you can go further and get the answer but best first search basically is is the search where you use heuristic value and you just pick up the best node irrespective of what your children are and what the parent’s heuristic value is.
In most cases if if you look at those chess puzzles, you'll find W and B.
And that's the second great thing about the ACO .
For example, the network is really slow and that that prompts me to think that there has to be something malicious happening.
So, you need to increase summation even for correct answers.
So that is what you do.
It is about having some predefined primitives and predefined links to be used for representing general English statements and any other language statements.
Implicit assumptions there in the program itself.
Now what is left?
So that's what exactly next rule talks about.
So that is the scripts were quite static.
There are a lot of things possible, four three is possible, four zero is possible, zero three is possible.
I I cleverly defined the values of farmer, fox, chicken and grain.
And the disadvantage of the second player, we've already seen the previous module that the last slide of the previous module talked about the the second player will not have some chances.
There are two stories provided.
Remember ant adds a pheromone value equal to the constant value C divided by the path length.
Okay , number six which move to choose?
If you don't say so, it is assumed it is default.
And we'll find out we’ll for all possible paths, we just add two components, we’ll find minimum and then start travelling.
What is deleted?
We have everything on the left hand side.
What is the precondition for place on table A?
Best first search is about exploring this but unlike hill climbing you will just pick up the best node.
You may ask me how have I decided rule number one to be applied.
You have no time to go back.
So, this expert and CPM will will tell you such type of charts, will tell you exactly what if one task is delayed, okay , what if a task gets delayed, whether the next task will be delayed if it is a prerequisite.
Unwinding accumulates the path.
Now, that is an example of the transfer of ownership; okay , such things are represented using the primitive called ATRANS , okay .
So, what you're supposed to do is to divide the experts knowledge into knowledge chunks or knowledge segments and knowledge segments is made up of many rules.
That is not a very good idea, usually it is little forty five degrees okay is most common case.
Now that is something where you combine multiple things into one.
Now, ‘kill’ is represented using this statement.
Instead if you if you do the other way around if you if you place B on the table, again start state does not have B on the table so that is one way it is not adding anything which is good, but the second one.
Welcome back friends to the twelth module of AI in which we are going to talk about a few more search algorithms.
DFS unlike BFS do not guarantee optimal solution.
Looking at the differences, probably we will have some idea what is different in in in computer artificial neuron, in the the brain compared to the the processors and the the we’ll learn about the motivation for having the artificial neuron.
Because the problem is less structured.
Twenty-six.
That is what we're going to study in this particular module.
Then pheromone it it’s a tendency to evaporate.
Seven cities are connected to each other using direct roads.
So, that's the problem.
There is a figure nine point one in the handout as well as in the PPT which clearly visualizes what I just talked about and this is called three three two network.
So, one is the actual distance, the other is estimated distance and based on that you will figure, you will find out which path is more promising, and we'll explore that path first.
This is a more critical part than it looks at the first shot.
Now this is the value P and if our R which is which we have randomly picked up is less than P, then we allow.
To capture that essence this kind of a structure is used.
And that's where probably Deep Thought team had somebody who was a grand master, chess grandmaster, was part of it.
So, it learns to to accept G even without that.
Branching factor is number of nodes that you’ll have as a child on an average.
The job is done.
And in fact this method, though we have not yet specified how it is, so we we’ll look it later.
Hello friends! We will begin with the third module on AI .
One of the method is called Nearest Neighbour algorithm which helps in finding out the the quite optimal solution for travelling salesman problem.
For pedagogy purpose, we can do that and that has been used even by Schank in in his papers.
So, you require that coder also.
When the program acts like this, it's basically working on the instruction of the designer which is impossible for complex cases like chess .
So, I don't have much to choose from but if you look at in little more detail, if you say that if you play the first move the leftmost move, okay , we have one chance to win but that is a minimizing move.
It defines learners of two different types, one type of learners are sensors, who learn from outside and the other type of learners are intuitors, they they they they learn from within, they they conceive things, they they process things, they think over whatever is presented and learn from them.
Deletion is if you just look at this it is phi, there is nothing which is common.
It is huge .
So both ways it is possible.
So thats about simulated annealing.
Okay . Our next one is called Depth first iterative deepening.
But when we have no directed this thing it becomes half.
Okay , Not only that one, second point is that you share what you have learned.
Now Do what does Nobita do with that stick is not mentioned in the statement.
Remember why?
We'll be talking about them at the end of this module.
Now we are increasing, increase the weights associated with all non-zero inputs so that’s what we are going to do in learning process.
It just sum things up and just check for the threshold or zero value.
So, that that is important.
CD does not provide you that context.
Now, let us try to formalize whatever we have stated.
These are four prerequisites.
Not only that, you can define variables and manipulate them in multiple ways.
It will shortlist five hundred out of that.
So in MiniMax algorithm, the exploration of tree happens in the winding phase.
toh longer paths lesser the pheromone.
Okay , look at that.
And why this sparse?
In missionary cannibal Sorry, it’s milk jug problem, sorry, it’s zero, zero, zero minus ten.
okay?So the the point is, There is no point exploring the next branch.
For example, we have a solution space where we have every node describing a solution.
okay ?
What my requirement is to reach to ten.
Okay and I’ve I’ve already talked about the chess playing programs use serious heuristics and sometimes the chess playing programs use heuristics based on the opponent.
After every input we adjust weights.
So, that is important thing here.
Back For back propagation algorithm what you need is a multi-layer neuron.
So, what you have to do is to reduce the temperature as fast as possible without affecting the stableness of the result, okay , and that actually there is no formula.
Now that's fine, it's a mechanical definition of a brother, but can you define brother that way?
And that's a very, very important thing.
Because, depending on those values you can determine whether it is possible to apply that rule or not.
Not only that, you can always apply a clear idea to simplify things.
In the initial run, you may use sparse neighbourhood to grow faster.
We don't have any other measuring device and would like to have exactly two gallons of water in a four gallon water jug.
One is called Path Representation which we already have done.
It is not white and black, not only white and black, it's also the player, the player one and player two sometimes.
How this is related to GA ?
So, we are not going towards goal we're going so going away from it.
So, place on top BA is to be inversely applied to get BA on top of the table okay .
This function calls some other function.
Because again, this you probably have seen a lot of beta releases yourself.
okay Who’d , you describe the problem in complete detail as much as you can.
That means that farmer is either on one side or the other.
So, these are two important principles of simulated annealing.
Fine.
And and you can use For example, ATRANS .
The other way around, if you provide the friend’s image and the summation is less than what is expected is called negative misclassification, okay .
So, if if you want to have an X-ray, what are the ingredients?
One slanting line , one with the this one's slanting and the other one is on the other slanting and the third one is the horizontal left to right up, left to right down and horizontal.
We have already seen the min layers are where the opponent is playing and max layer is where we are playing, okay .
The other precondition is, if A equal to not Fr what does that mean the farmer is not on the the left side, okay A is on the left side .
And why it is darkened?
The first one.
And let us pick up the first rule and you can see in your handout that the rule is pretty simple, which which connects a picture producer or an actor with an act and is a double sided arrow which is used which talks about which which conveys that is a double dependency and it it uses.
The cyclic crossover is little different so I have chosen a longer to make sure you understand.
The parent one is A, C, B, D, E, F, G out of that we will copy the middle three elements B, D and E in the child.
So, the values there are there are many variables used and those values are are between minus ten to ten.
And…And many times CD attempts to get more information out of that statement.
In fact, the algorithm is pretty simple.
You know that in a given chemical structure, something which is impossible , is impossible.
So, it can always do it.
Whatever decisions that I make, I'll have to have that KE and expert sit together and they decide that. This is the structure that they need.
Now we have that initial state and final state.
6,2,0 is also a child of 3,2,3.
Not only that one very, very powerful mechanism, one very, very powerful inference that you can get out of script is that it can predict unusual events, unusual sequence of events and can see that there is something wrong. For example, ‘Jay went to watch the match.
So that is very expensive.
And again, 0,5,3 we have 2,3,3 and 3,5,0 which is again repeated.
We just assume that is the solution and test if it is a solution if it’s not, we quit.
And the deletion you know what is the deletion?
So these two things are being sent back.
The steepest ascent hill climbing, the the little different version of it, you can generate all nodes and pick up the best and and so on.
So, the every image contains some pixels which are black some pixels which are white.
But remember what we need to do is what we need to do for positively misclassified and negatively misclassified.
sneeze And there's one more thing.
Now, if you increase the summation, the value is available on on on the y axis, larger the summation, higher the value, more the value.
I saw the match, or I watched.
There is some dynamic issue in the path.
So, there is no way to represent high level context.
When the representation is confined to the very statement, now script, actually help us improve that and there is one more example which I gave in the the handout that I went to Indroda Park, which is a natural zoo in Gandhinagar with kids you assume that a lot of other things like I bought tickets, I I took my car inside and I parked my car in the in the parking zone, I took all picnic related material from my car, went inside, enjoyed watching animals and had my breakfast or whatever there, moved around, come back took the car and go back.
So that is one way and then it is quite possible that you take the entire sequence again.
Because there is a likelihood of failure.
Now there is the first one, Okay .
The time is one, the branching factor of the tree is one more.
The other interesting thing is that the strength of CD also is the weakness.
Then we’ll apply static evaluation function to each children.
‘I MTRANS match’ and ‘I INGEST ice okay They happen together.
For example, TCPIP knowledge is needed for intrusion detection, but the whole thing is available in form of RFCs , you just get that RFC and get that information.
So, now when there is a dead end the last parent will explore its right child.
The simple programs are are are pretty hard on the face of it.
Let us take a very simple example.
What we have seen in this particular module.
Now here and this is something also which we've already looked at in the previous module, the statement that we have encountered in previous module.
Now I want actually to find out path from A to again back to A considering all seven cities but the rest is not known to me.
And we what we want is we want everybody remain intact at the end of the problem and if the farmer is not around, fox may eat chicken and chicken and may eat grain.
One more is a horizontal line.
Please understand these values like fuzzy logic depends on context.
Now that yesterday is is indicated. Now you can see that it’s not a double arrow it’s a single arrow.
But then there are other preconditions.
Also, we have seen relevance of a state.
It is also used in in satellites by ISRO scientist, because again over there, there is an issue about power as well as this thing , so they innovatively used this thing .
And here is an example given on the on the slide. Dead is minus ten.
For example, when you eat something, you’re taking a solid object from outside, ingesting it or drinking something which is liquid, which you're taking in.
The neurons don’t remain their steady living, they they are constantly dying.
So, that is acceptable.
The order crossover is very similar to the earlier one but the other thing that we are going to keep the order intact. Okay .
How do How do I get one?
Then you have the middle layer in remember middle layer you have total N units.
It says that the next block is empty.
So, that is basically summation and how HI values are calculated, we have already seen that.
Is a function which is is applied to a state.
So, the next slide actually talks about talks about how you can write the rule in little more flexible, little more general way.
Whats the annealing schedule?
And you can see after arrow, we have L M one minus M, C three minus C, what does it mean?
I I can apply that thing at level one.
Apply next rule if no operator is left return with best so far.
Lot of people came out with lot of models and plenty of model that exists in literature.
okay .
So, because I I don't have complete information every time opponent plays, I’ll generate a an entire subtree as as much as big subtree as I can, and just pick up the next move every time.
Usually you look at all this information and whether see whether this statement contains some of these script headers.
But then it says ‘with a stick.’ Now, how do you represent that part ‘with a stick?’
What what is what is the pheromone value that an ant add?
So you can modify that.
So, you may look at them and let me recap what we have done in this particular module.
Sounds simple, it is.
And again the theory says that it is possible to to use a single hidden layer and a single hidden layer can do a job which multiple hidden layers can do.
Thank you.
Dhoni rides a bike.
In some cases it is not possible.
Now the earlier module we described both methods which are they are they are quite common and they are quite general in the sense that many variants of them exist in in in the real world.
We stop when there is a six ply explored.okay .
Parent node is explored again to get its next child.
Okay .
In the first module, we have looked at what AI is and what the what are the problems which AI is trying to address and so on and so forth.
Okay , one may one more example is replace a move not changed for long .
Those problems include a very simple problem called exoar .
Assume an assembly of people from multiple countries and the speaker is speaking in one typical language and there is a program called translator which what that program does is just listen to what the person is speaking and try to translate that into the language, okay .
For example, finding out right set of, now this quite interesting.
We know.
So, you may not use them but you will find them.
Physical annealing process allows the metal to cool down and reach to a stable state and it is found that the the process of cooling down has a serious impact on the the the stableness of the result and it allows some randomness in the movement.
We have seen how you can use a a vector.
So, that is a conceptualized in the lization that we see in rule number seven.
Now, we have already seen that this is something which we’d like to avoid.
It is a valid state.
ok W. B chooses obviously the player B or player two chooses minimum value of static evaluation function.
Anyway, so there we are not using them, we are only using player one and player two here.
Okay , so for one conceptualization the other conceptualization is used as an object.
Both of them cannot be one.
You placing A on the table.
By completely filling this and rest escaping here and and the eight nine and so on, you can you can read these remaining rules yourself and you can see that they are completely self-explanatory, Okay .
Consider the input coming from lot of frames, sensors and all that.
So it has to be that way.
If it is not, he cannot do it.
Based on that, there are some minute differences.
Before you have a recursive call you must provide your terminating criteria because when you make a recursive call it goes to the it it invokes one more instance and we'll continue doing it, if you have not specified a terminating criteria before.
Fingerprint recognition probably is is something that you have seen quite a lot in recent days.
So, if you reach to a state which is not acceptable or when you reach to a move which is not acceptable only because it is impossible using the move to move from one this state to this state.
Now think of the state that he he he has to look at; ceiling above the floor, there's a floor beneath, there are objects around in the in the room, chair, sofa, lights, so on .
Otherwise if you write the algorithm differently, the iterative way, is going to be very tough.
For example, in case of chess, queen has much, much higher value than a pawn.
Why?
How can you represent the same problem in multiple ways and and what are the advantages of one type of representation or the other?
If you do not use heuristics, unguided.
It says if at(pawn, black, i,j).
Previous state equal to current state minus A dot additions and union , now it is union because there may be a few things which are repeated.
But then at level one I don't get much information this the the heuristic or static evaluation function are just estimates and I go near to the goal I get better estimate.
So, that's the reason why what you need to do is to re-run the program.
So we can solve it manually and can instruct the program to do it.
You can see that Nobita INGEST because he is eating rice ‘eat’ is represented as INGEST sorry and the object is rice, double arrow as usual because it is past tense P but that is used as an instrument.
With that we will conclude this genetic algorithm module number eight.
So, there was no ontology.
Now the parent one is A, C, B, D, E, F, G Okay and now remember the child one, we have already taken the part from parent two now the rest is to be picked up from parent one we have already talked about.
Same about D and H okay only the value is eight.
I'll talk about that soon what I mean, okay . You may do that, for example, you may just pick up top five, okay , nodes in chess kind of , okay and pick up the best at the end.
In fact, one was about death of a very successful horse race horse without any apparent disease and and a spouse killing the other one because of insurance money.
Combinatorial explosion is number of options that you have.
So A, B, C, D, E, F, G is a same tours as G, F, E, D, C, B, A okay the reverse path is the same.
If he has not learned, expert expert should be able to explain him what is lacking and why and all that.
Similarly, M two plus M the the number of missionaries now we are going to have on the right hand side, must be greater than or equal to number of cannibals on the right hand side.
For example, in case number two, you might have four one three is the final state and the the earlier one also you can have two and zero or two and sorry zero and two, three and two is also possible.
The first generate and test is to find out which class the sample belongs to and then that generate and test is is to figure out what subclass that these sample belongs to.
I assumed it exists so I am not worrying about that right now.
And you can see the best first search the next figure in the the slide shows how best first search works.
One more thing that might come to your mind that is it possible for you to represent the same statement in two different ways?
We are into ninth module of AI .
We we just do addition or subtraction.
You can see that in this case, we'll have to move our king and sacrifice our queen.
You just explore your children, apply heuristic function and pick up, Okay sorry.
What does that mean?
Okay .
I have to be there at the bus stand, kind of Okay .
For example, one simple method is to cut string at a typical place.
If you start thinking like this from the ground level, you probably come out with very, very different, maybe exclusively different from this particular side and still be able to represent your statement.
And the third one is 5,3,0.
We have X zero to XN as an input.
This is again an example of an invalid move .
So, everybody understand about that system, their own role and what they expect from others, what other expects from them in a very clear terms.
It's called positional value.
How this starts?
Look at three examples given in on the slide. 8-0-0, 3-5-0, 8-0-0.
There are three examples shown on the screen.
The opponent may start the The first case, it is MiniMax start state zero and one .
Here we can say that a ticket is a prop, seat is a prop, and so on so forth.
And who is propelling it?
So, what we have to do is, the previous state equal to what current state minus all additions, additions are to be removed, whatever additions are provided they are to be removed.
Okay , let us take a simpler case of having just one one friend.
What is the value of N in the previous example?
There are a few statements like, I I just talked about Ram is in love with Sita, Ram loves Sita, Ram found Sita loving and these all statements will have same representation.
I'm I’m segregating each one at L Fr.
It starts with the start state start state at a as a root node.
We have seen that the the AI programs, one of the major obstacles in solving problems, the AI problems, is to characterize them precisely.
But it is basically not.
If it is not , what should I do?
Now, what’s tricky about this?
So, the normal generate and test is applied only when the classification is done.
So delta is decrement in the value of the objective function when you talking about a new state you see how decrement it happens.
They're called intuitors, the first type of learners are called sensors.
He learns about conveying his idea now.
So, every domain has the jargon associated with it.
So, fine.
This I am This person is recognized clearly.
So, a tolerance level is point one.
So, you need to look at the design which can provide all this.
There is no you you have nothing to choose actually.
Anyway, let us talk about why it is an excellent method of solving some very, very interesting AI problems.
So, this is a very, very critical part of the system design, the expert system design.
For example, I have A, B and C.
That is not happening here.
Again as I said, I am not going to discuss all crossover methods, we are only going to see a few useful methods which are used in TSP.
So, it just multiplies, xi wi, xi wi, x one w one, x two w two, x three w three at at this point of time I am not bothered about layers.
So, these are the three things which happen if you say place on table A, okay .
Look at the slide.
So what's the saving?
It is quite possible that you apply the same MoveGen function and what will it do?
There are a lot of other properties which makes MOP a far better solution than scripts.
Now how it is summed up?
And it is quite possible that you traverse some futile, useless states.
So we can't jump from one state to the other unless we have a legal move connecting them.
If the length is more , just terminate.
So, those and what what’s the role of an action?
Pretty complex.
And second what we want is is is is to make the program more intelligent , program to solve the problem itself, not the designer solving it and hard coding it in the program.
Can you do that by computer?
I'm talking about an average which belongs to that range.
And obviously this this clearly indicates that we need heuristic based searches. Okay .
If a an opponent has two consecutive cells occupied and the third cell is empty, is a very less value almost defeat okay .
So the child one now has E star which which we will still have to fill B, G, A star D.
So far, we have said that we provide input, we we say that this is the right output, if the program generate a wrong output we convert that, we we change weights to make sure it generates the right output.
Test if it is a solution.
What are the rules?
If it you are not going to remember it for a long period.
It can actually learn on its own, can look at names of names which it cannot understand, ask user, learn about them, place them in the database and so on, so forth.
The opponent.
Okay 5,0,3 there is one typical result is again 8,0,0 which again we’ll not explore further because it is a cycle.
So here also we are doing it.
If it if it is phi acceptable, if it is not, not acceptable.
So, I'll pick up that child, the third one, if I'm doing it.
Dense neighbourhood gives you more number of nodes.
And you can see that at the end we what we have is four four zero that means four gallons of milk in in the eight gallon jug. okay .
A state space representation is about storing information in a form that there is something called an initial state, the problem’s state in the beginning , when the problem commences the problem is in the initial state.
So, everything that is important is actually listed.
The okay , you can see that when Ram killed Ravan, Sita was happy.
X is the amount of milk in jug the eight gallon jug.
okay so you you use multiple agents but eventually it’ll converge to a single path which is the best path.
But that is quite acceptable.
E F G H is not six twelve or four.
If you know about that letter you may replace ‘do.’
We’ve already seen that it is possible to represent the problem using State-space.
And that’s the reason why we’re not going to discuss much about this.
That's great.
Because, his opponent will want to play.
In fact, it it it allows you to pick up the best child, not only that irrespective of the parents value.
In in case where backtracking is impossible, for example, chess.
So, these are this is a new state.
So, there is a P on on top of the double arrow.
The terminating criteria is tested by calling a function call over.
Object case relationship and the Sachin and and ATRANS that relationship double arrow - P.
But then if you if you bond.
Relevant and non-relevant actions.
In first thing is called winding phase.
Now if you remember our best first search and all that we we used something similar.
So once they are copied as it is, you have complete child A.
We have already seen that.
The other ant also starts spraying the pheromone along the same path and it'll add to the the amount of pheromone and what does that mean?
But the other yes, an an important here is representation of the state, the mental state - sad and happy.
Why?
So, you can see.
What about the second one?
It's a pretty trivial using a vector.
Now what we do is just we just check if the first sequence is a solution, second sequence is a solution, third sequence is a solution and so on, so forth.
Traveling salesman problem for example, when we talk about, if you want to get the tour which is optimal we may start with a random tour A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H or something here A, B, C, D, E, F are are are cities.
Now on the other side, you can see that not D and not C is about the other side okay .
Well anyway, there is one excellent expert system which was known as Dendral, designed to use generate and test.
Okay , let me even talk about, the pheromone value is the length is is inversely proportional to length.
okay So, when the terminating criteria is reached you have to come back.
Begins with zero but then it'll increment every time. So, when you get back you know where I am okay so if somebody is already told us that after a sufficient depth you'll have to come back maybe a terminating criteria.
With that we’ll come to an end of this particular module.
Why?
In fact, there are more complex problems than chess.
There are a lot of other complexities.
It is not very good.
So, that neural network program could do it.
If you want the the answer, the solution, in minimum number of steps from the the root node or the initial state, BFS is the best solution.
okay , There are a lot of things which happen.
If you if you look at the search process that is that is described earlier you move in this direction and this direction and this direction you may feel that it’s quite jittery.
For example, I've started from A and I want to reach to Z.
You require a tester who is going to test the system, who is going to write test cases and going to run once the system is developed.
Again opponent.
Progression is relevant to our goal state if some part of the resultant state is in the goal state and removed part must not be in the goal state okay .
We have looked at many other things in past, we talked about MiniMax layers, we talked about heuristic function which is called static evolution function, we've also seen that a game tree has expanded to the maximum possible level, static evolution function is applied at the leaf node, is backed up and based on which you'll decide the next node to choose.
That throwing stone is used as an instrument to to get this the other thing done.
what is ‘Do’?
So, when I say I'm throwing a stone, actually that involves more than one primitives.
See I started with A, , the the element correspond to A and parent two is D, the the same D appears at position number four in this case, so D at position four is copied, Okay , here.
Think of it.
Suppose if you have a company where there are thousands of employees working and you would like to retain them.
Okay , I could actually have written that as well.
Anyway, so that is one thing which we'll have to work on.
Information characteristics what is also very important because you are going to design your class based on that, okay .
So, that is representation as the E okay Effect link. So, you can see that.
It's very strict form actually you can't have any kind of link that you want, you can't have can't have any type of node and again, allowed links and allowed nodes are always fixed.
okay , The program should interact with patient as if the program itself is a doctor.
First, we would like to win as long as possible.
And the value, the heuristic value that that path that move enable says how good or bad that thing is.
There is a formula you just apply if the heuristic function give you exact measure of how far the goal node is, you don’t need to do.
We have already seen that even classified, correctly classified inputs are also learning, in case of sigmoid.
So, we find out objective function value of a new state minus the objective function value of the current state.
You may think why it is done that way?
That's the path.
We don't really know.
It is impossible because everything is happening in real time.
So, place on top of B is better, more relevant then place on top of a CD because you will get a better state okay .
Okay .
So, the terminating criteria comes here.
For example, I have three inputs A, I and H and I have I am showing three different images of A but two images of one each of I and H.
That value is, we have assumed that value is four.
So that that heuristic can help you finding better paths before and three more branches of search tree and obviously you will be able to gain a lot in terms of the search time.
Designing problem logic, conventional diagrams are used in many cases and they are absolutely fine.
So, the first thing that they wanted to do is is to have a neuron which they call artificial neuron.
That's the other thing.
And we have seen that is quite good.
So simulated annealing is is is a better method compared to hill climbing but anyway it is also a a superset of hill climbing.
If I have N it is thirty-five raised to N number of moves I'll have to apply, evaluate them for that particular case for a single move every time .
The first part how to write this function actually depends on the domain .
Similarly, when you have negative misclassification it is the images of your friend and it is not saying yes, then we will have to increase the amount of summation and again, anything multiplied by zero is not contributing, so will only increase .
Now, the question is whether it can learn or not that is one thing, but it also is theoretically it is possible that it can learn.
The next slide talks about the shape of the square function.
So, why we are talking about Unguided Search Methods too?
That is quite different than other algorithms.
So, when you design these forms and reports, let the normal user read and understand what it is.
You may ask me, is it a good move?
The root node is 8,0,0 or initial node. Now what we do now is we apply all possible rules and generate all possible states which can be generated from eight in the next level.
The algorithm is simple.
So, that is a difference, okay .
And if it is four four plies one four four zero zero zero in case of twenty, seven seven one seven five zero in case of thirty five for five plies you can see is going way beyond .
For all source and destination you will be able to get this.
We are moving back, we're talking about moving back, but basically, we are going to solve the problem in a forward direction only .
What are the expectations?
Think of it.
As I said, researchers tried to mimic brain.
So I'm not going to play C.
That is done.
So, state change is inflicted by that acting, okay .
Now that is a very hard problem very hard solution but that's the best solution if you can get.
Okay , this is again different than the hill climbing because if this were hill climbing, one cannot be explored, it has lesser value than two.
And here one more interesting thing about travelling salesman problem is we can we can actually choose a Sparse neighbourhood or dense neighbourhood function.
Earlier we used to write the value of the variable the variable itself.
What's the second one?
Just take the case of branching factor twenty .
So, I’m I'm not going to talk in detail about But the idea is to have user’s input and other expert’s input and get the system better over the period of time, provide corrections to the knowledge base and sometimes the primary expert himself.
B is one fifty and C is one fifty.
Now you pick up on A table and you realize that it is already achieved.
Now this is little more tricky .
So,and and if I get one as thirty-four the other one is twenty-two my lower amount reduces to twenty-two.
So, that was all three possible cases in Tic Tac Toe which is also the same in chess.
So if two is explored we get minus three, minus two and one .
Answer is MBUILD ING something, in a response to a question and you again after that once that is done, you also use MTRANS from that mind to the mouth, Okay , so that that is done in fact, answer is represented like that, Okay .
So this is also very, very critical phase.
It cannot understand because it has the ability to understand Gary Kasparov’s moves but it cannot understand this move.
And it is based on the idea of how life forms persist.
We have looked at something called generate and test.
The other thing how many samples do I need?
What about fox, chicken and grain all three of them on one side?
The rest is an estimate, okay .
Yes, it was part of the start state that is deleted.
If they are similar, we don't need to move around start space is the goal state.
You won't find number of cannibals more than number of missionaries.
Repeated or goal is not explored further.
If we call A as an action and addition a and deletion are functions, toh what we can do it with our methods or so we say that A A dot addition, the action A adds whatever it adds okay it’s called A dot addition and we take an intersection with goals state, we call it GS .
But here usually a simpler method is picked up, you apply fitness function and out of twenty select five.
Branch and bound is for other problems as well.
And in some cases, they’re applied in a hybrid way.
We have already seen how specific and general move can be written.
If you have arranged them in some other fashion and only other fashion possible is on BA before and on A table next, like this the other case.
So when you find statement talking about something abnormal which is not mentioned in the script, probably the results are not there.
So, that is called complete network.
Tau is the value of pheromone equal to T T tau T the earlier one multiplied by one minus rho okay .
The problem state.
Okay , let let us look at this thing in in a little more classic way.
In a way that in the initial run you you allow that okay some some move to a bad state from a current state is allowed.
It's distinct path is tour covering all cities.
And if it recognizes it is fine, if does not recognize you will have to change those weights, okay .
Basically, it is represented by Propel is physically physical force and also PTRANS, okay .
When we say we dined there that we we went into that, we we have looked at the menu, we ordered something, we ate those things. And there are waiters who who who who delivers those things to us, serve those things to us and we paid the bills obviously and then left.
Okay , it's time.
So far only three guys were involved - the user, knowledge engineer, and expert.
But we assume that thing.
So, classification can be only one, correct classification, right image, friend’s image is friend’s, non-friend’s is non-friend, great .
And then there is a recipient case relationship , where I is it's coming from eyes, the information is coming from eyes and going to CP , when I'm watching a match, that information is going inside my mind so that's what is done.
The problem is about a farmer, fox, chicken and the grain finding themselves on the one side of the river and they have to move on the other side.
That is not going to work.
So the beauty of having a hidden layer is that it can figure out the features from the input and based on those features, the output unit can learn to become active or inactive.
We say that at R Fr which is very clear.
So, this is what we are we are supposed to do.
There's no missionary actually.
That is what we like we would like to prevent the opponent to win okay .
So, if you if you do it for a very large time, you probably run out of time.
So, you ask them and you learn.
For example, animate objects like Sachin and sometimes even natural forces can also be used in CD as the actors, Okay .
You have to have prerequisites, you have to have variables.
Minus one is the best node right now , Okay .
There's no difference just named as objective function.
sorry I cannot talk about right now, if you if you look at the mathematical background of some algorithms like Back propagation, you probably will be able to understand why differentiation is a must.
Because it's quite worse.
The There is some similarity.
So, that’s precisely the the theme of this particular module.
When they are they are successful in finding it.
Now, one interesting rule that comes next is that sometimes the act inflicts the state change.
So, that's kind or or health equals to five then he is happy, health health equals to ten then he is ecstatic , okay , kind of representation that is possible using CD .
So simple?
You can see that should not because he has gone but then he heard about the the demise of his grandfather and he has come back.
in fact generation of solutions one after the other and and doing it in a way that humans and other spaces do in a way that eventually what you get are better solutions search.
H While C has three children, H is seven, I is minus nine and J is five.
Pick up the start node and make it current, Okay , the start node and take up all nodes, and store them in the sorted order of heuristic value.
One more thing is that once this is done, they they look at this and understand whether problem solution should not go in wrong direction.
I’ve already talked about the need.
An in fact if if you have read about something called Felder-Silverman model, if you're a teacher probably, you have heard about that Felder-Silverman model and and Myers-Briggs model, that was little older.
Okay that causal relationship because this thing has causal relationship, you can conclude something which was not explicitly mentioned in the the statement, okay .
Because these scenes are directly introduced into the the target representation when that statement is encountered.
You probably have heard about Google car, that is self-driving car.
If it is less, i'll I am not going to play that move. I only play P.
Every city is directly connected with every other city, so we have lot of paths,
Now, in true sense such things are not acceptable.
I've already talked about two cases chess and robot domain and even car automated car domain where this is just impossible .
So, they’ll also test their knowledge and this is a very, very useful, important learning experience.
It’s it’s again is something that you cannot explain.
Think of it
it is quite possible that we may not write one rule without which we cannot solve the problem.
Changes genes drastically but provides an escape route.
So, people are working on it, but there is no solution yet.
Okay . A process called random walk is is about its very similar to our generate and test.
Its comparatively much simpler to represent .
And it has few places to go but almost all places are occupied.
I'm I do not have any copy right now I do not have anything to begin with.
That is quite possible in case of expert system.
So, this associative search is also something where human brains are far better compared to us the computers.
Now, the statement does not indicate that store but the If you have an ontology, probably you can have that.
We have looked at a problem called Three Four Gallon Water Jug problem and Eight Five Three Gallon Milk Jug problem where we've shown how why they they those problems can be represented using state space and so on so forth.
Number of nodes from a given node, Okay and average number is higher.
Usually this value is between minus ten and ten, so that value will give you the the ranking of or the merit of every state that you have at your disposal and you can choose the best one.
Now I'm I’m using hurt as hurt only.
If the root node is reached and no further children to be explored, the search process ends there unsuccessfully.
And also, it is it indicates that the hostage’s health which was earlier other than minus ten becomes ten because he's dead now.
The other one is called Order crossover.
We can we are looking at a cricket match and you see a side face of a friend and you recognize him.
Ram Ram has done something to Ravan.
We don't have programs which can play many other games , but still we have programs which can play chess.
You can see that it is being repeated yet again but now for two levels. Okay .
In chess, it is possible to have a situation where you cannot proceed further, there is no way to proceed further.
What does it mean?
This is rule one which talks about a very simple relation between PP and ACT , okay .
KE , however good KE is, he is not that knowledgeable.
Feed forward means, the inputs are flowing in the forward direction.
We are not going to discuss many things about GA and I have I have given one or two references at the end of this chapter and end of this module.
They start travelling in random directions.
So, those numbers, the order also is not going to be similar in in other if you refer to some other material.
Now you talk about two different scripts in this particular statement - watching a match and coming back by bus.
So obviously we need to have unexplored nodes.
P is the probability.
That is the addition that was not there that was not true before now it becomes true so that is an additional thing.
Okay , the heuristic search process.
And I'm I’m talking about a very simple case.
So, the the the reasoning that they had is buried inside their that thing.
We are not going to discuss all of them.
Thank you.
How do you know that this is a valid state?
This brain is very different than computer the computer processor and now we’ll be discussing about the differences between these two.
One more line, one more hidden unit learn to become active and it is it is right it’s it’s it’s going down from right to left to right.
which I where the solution can be found is pretty useful. And there is something, I call Hierarchical Generate and Test.
M one C one is number of missionaries and number of cannibals and obviously indicates and, R indicates right , the right side.
Then we apply the first rule which makes it four, so this state is good so we move to four .
So, here, again it’s called direction.
Think of it.
okay You can see that both examples or both conceptualizations.
Quite interesting.
But then we have explored enough number of plies.
In fact, not only that is better to represent, it is also better to code and run faster .
So that is called perturbation search, Okay , unlike the constructive search that we have seen so far.
Okay .
So that dependency is one way.
So what do they do?
So it's better if you explore everything together and in such a case, beams search is one of the best solutions.
A same is the case with three A.
The transfer about something where the mind is involved.
Nine into nine matrix and I want to recognize A.
For two reasons.
With that we’ll conclude this particular module.
So, it’s not all that wasteful, Okay .
Now remember, brain uses a stimuli, some information that is coming in, plus weight, okay .
So, when but it's basically a leaf node, okay though we say that we'll go out five plies depth.
Now we are, when a node which is explored is already already explored before we’ll not explore it further for obvious reasons.
The first node is minus five, not very good.
In fact nearest neighbor is quite interesting.
For example, Sachin’s elbow okay .
That's used as a placeholder.
My table drawer is the third.
One , very simple method is to use normal way of using binary neuron as a single digit.
What you get are are six-seven children and you apply that that fitness function, the the value, the distance value.
Now, please understand the action is applied like this so previous to new.
So, this is an example of how addition or deletion can be done.
MiniMax algorithm is one of the oldest algorithms of game playing.
You can see that the representation Sachin and PTRANS.
And the first call of this algorithm will take the starting state.
So, if the X is greater than or equal to three, so here we have more amount of milk.
Second also connects to first second and third and so on.
But, while going through it at some point or on the other we realize that we we quite accurate, we're very good, we can come back and for which, we have written a function call over.
Because at leaf node we have the most this heuristic function or static evaluation functions are what?
So, in fact, in this case Sachin and ATRANS dependent on each other.
And that's the fact.
Okay . Why sparse neighbourhood is to be chosen?
We decide what we want to achieve.
One slanting line like this, the other slanting line like this.
And what we want in the end state is C is resting on D and B is resting on A this is what I want.
But then, such when you keep question marks, there are encounter later statements.
An example is again shown with the same one and let us use goal stack planning.
So, what we need is an static evaluation function.
How can the move assume that value?
We have seen that AI is about solving difficult problem and GA is one great way of solving difficult problems.
First requirement is that the solution path should not contain any cycles.
You have a long term maintenance plan, you decide that thing and write that thing down.
Try to see and try to understand.
That’s called State Space.
The other example, ‘terrorists shot hostage’.
Thank you.
So, let us start talking about them. The first step here is prototype construction and conceptualization.
The row which we discussed, in fact we can assume it to be part of summation, is again very simple, what we are doing is x one w one plus x two w two x three w three and so on.
So in the beginning it'll be this, later on it will be the other one and if the opponent starts playing, in chess it is possible that we may not start.
So, L is this and R is exactly opposite to this and that is very important.
Next action, third action, fourth action.
will initialize the bast with whatever minimum value.
Is a repeat node or dead end we’ll try the right, Okay .
and in in in making sure that the enemy does not, the the prey does not get the the hint of their moving, so that they are on prowl.
I'm actually I have cheated because I've already solved that problem and I know that this is how the problem is going to be solved.
So, that is possible.
If I have three consecutive cells occupied state is one ten.
They are able to solve some problems, unsolvable for years.
You can see that this three A's which are shown here are quite different to each other.
Current state is defined as free A on AB on BC on CD and on D table okay .
The What are those types?
You may not be able to solve in one using one combination, you may be able to solve using other combination that also is possible sometimes.
Six two out of sixteen but there is a possibility that there is twenty and then you choose two.
You continue doing that eventually what you get a better solution set hopefully.
First , if you learn about Unguided Search Methods, you can always improve them by providing heuristics.
Jay stayed in a queue for an hour or so got bored and returned back home.’
Props are the objects involved in the script.
So, I'm not here to discuss object oriented programming.
I would better evaluate this position of the state in little more detail, a little more elaborated fashion.
So that’s the first requirement.
So, for that purpose, we are keeping that placeholder here.
Reading is about transforming the MTRANS information from for example, I'm I’m reading a newspaper.
But here that part is not important the part important here is bike.
Let me tell you it is quite possible that if a novice, a player is playing against Deep Blue and play a very stupid move, the Deep Blue will will get confused that what is happening.
M one M are substracted.
There's no way you can judge when you cannot judge they are called fleeting scripts and the the programmers solution to this problem is you just keep a pointer.
The job is done.
No.
Expert learns about his own role.
That that is possible.
I can move to three,five,zero and I move I can move to three,two,three, Okay .
I’ll have eight eight into eight matrix and provide positions of the pieces on the board which which in turn is the representation of a chessboard.
But that is not going to be the case in most complicated problems.
In this module we have what we have done?
In certain cases like this value of pawn maybe more than a queen.
For example, there is an obstacle which is placed.
So, that is one way of showing, but then how many such moves can you write for the chess?
So, a person also involved from that angle.
The other case we are placing B on top of table.
Okay , so you provide those employees, twenty, thirty employees and their fifty odd images of each one of them is fed into the system.
So that's what I mean by legal moves.
So I'm skipping and I'm I'm pruning all those branches, okay .
We have seen depth-first search where we explore all nodes from a root node and try to see if it's the solution.
Okay , there is something called steepest ascent hill climbing, which is a little different than the hill climbing, Okay .
Okay , so let us see what heuristic search methods are.
Let us see why we are discussing about GAs .
For example, when I'm here to detect intrusion, I should not waste my time finding out differentiating between different attacks.
Now, in travelling salesman problem you have cities, they are connected and those connections we we call them segments.
so point is the only better spaces, only better individuals are likely to survive.
One, the heuristic value of this .
Now that precondition, the the actions precondition, the state's precondition should also be there.
Heuristic value is not an exact answer and that’s why it it has to be that way.
So, for example, the input layer, we have five neurons - one two three four five.
The statement does not give you from where he started.
Now, you can use what we have studied, but looking at the figure itself yes, okay .
Third unit will learn to become active and the horizontal line is.
In some cases, player and opponent or something, okay .
The solution is that you try something else .
So, this is the other rule and the last rule.
These rules that I talked about thirteen fourteen rules.
And what it comes out with, is the value, Okay , how good or bad but ten, minus ten to ten in conventional way but you can design your own way.
There are two outgoing possible paths.
For looking at that important characteristics of moving around in state space, we have taken one more rather two more examples here in this particular module.
And on the right hand side Fr, fx, ch and grain.
The other case where you've already won or lost.
Delta E is a difference between the previous and the current state or the current state and the next state that we are trying to explore. Okay .
okay , If In most cases, we do it that way only.
One is winning.
So we start from one, the initial state we move across the the state space and we’ll reach to the final state. deep breath .
Not BPNN is not used a little modified algorithm is used there.
You may be surprised.
The next one is called sigmoid.
When you place X at the left top is not very good because I'm not going to achieve anything on that column it is possible to have on the right the top most row but it is not.
Okay So, we are considering L to be six, then all three cases are are possible to be provided, Okay .
In simulated annealing, you're allowed to choose a little less optimal path sometimes.
So in case number one, now it once it is backed up the next slide looks shows that.
And if you want to get one you will have to get the summation should be positive infinity, which is very hard, almost impossible to get.
So, if you feel that it is not very good about CD , it is actually the problem with the language and not CD .
In which situation I I ask the user or the patient to do that and how many times I'm successful in my assumption?
So, prototype will give you an idea how the final system would look like and and prototype can be very, very simple, proto en cal be as good as the final system.
SEF is a Static Evolution Function is many a times is not a single entity.
That makes it an important cutoff here and this this happens at maximizing layer.
In fact, I've just given you an idea about this.
Albino for example, or having the heart on the right side or something like that.
It tests whether you are fit.
One major challenge that we have stressed is to choose a move.
Rule number twelve, okay .
Y was free, now Y is not free okay .
Okay , that that indicates that thing you can see that the recipient of that is is LA.
They they are dependent on each other and that is being used as an instrument.
At this point of time we have not assigned any status to it, whether it is win leading to a win leading to loss or leading to draw.
What is the solution?
Unguided search methods does not use heuristic.
So, that also is very, very important role of a concept in CD .
With that, we'll come to a close.
The only difference is the the boat is on the right hand side and we are moving from right to left.
What the requirement is, that at no point of time you can have number of cannibals more than number of missionaries on on on any bank of the river.
So, that is what it is doing and researchers are looking at nature for inspiration and there are many examples like ant colony optimization, and what they learned how ants find shortest path to their food source, they devise algorithm capable of working with small components like ants, they call agents, and which is very, very low intelligent intelligence level agent with less memory, less power.
See, the first, now we what we are doing is, we are we are taking the same example, 8-5-3- gallon water jug.
And also the detailed this thing description of script probably will have scoreboards and many other things, the screens and so on so forth.
It might contain number of variables, it might contain number of conditions.
Sometimes it is possible that a static node is here, the ending node is quite far and the surrounding nodes there are plenty of surrounding nodes in a near that thing .
While watching match, I ate ice cream.
There are other ways of doing it.
The amount of pheromone obviously is more on this.
With that we’ll come to an end of this module.
Number of pieces their respective rating, for example, Queen is rated much higher than others and King is rated much, much higher than everybody else so on so forth.
So , it is basically hill climbing but with little randomness.
Okay .
Okay there are a lot of other prerequisites that the match you must be at the same place where match is happening and so on and so forth which I’ve not talked about.
Now support planning requires you to like when you roll out the expert system, people take time to get used to it and they face more problems than conventional systems because these are different types of systems.
But when KE observes the expert, he’ll learn a lot about that.
So, that doesn't happen in conventional systems, but it does here.
And collection of all valid states is called a state space .
so opponent will not choose that.
Our queen is captured.
Now, this is little different than hill climbing, a little better than hill climbing in some sense.
It is not.
And we want to an estimate A, B, C, D, E, F, G. Now E, F, G, you just calculate that using the simple heuristic that I talked about, that table and find out.
Now, that's not the case here.
The problem with this method is that it is pretty expensive in terms of memory.
Now that is little different function.
Let me tell you there is no theoretical guarantee of this process.
So total sixteen actually.
Here also build solutions.
It is not so.
Boat can carry maximum two.
you just get five best solutions and then then mingle them in a way that you get twenty better solutions and then again pick up five, and so and so forth.
Now, it is quite possible that Abdul is a person who is looking for a job and Rajan is a placement consultant or he's a smuggler and Rajan Rajan is a smuggler and Abdul is good at motorboats and so on so forth.
So that is called generate offspring from random current of this thing .
So, I don't need to go further.
L okay , the next one is N and D.
So, you what you can do is now earlier we were talking about pouring milk in in three gallon water jug.
If the node is a goal node, it quits.
Okay , so that is what best first search is.
You can see rule number nine is applied, then four, then eleven, then one, then nine again and then two and eleven.
So let us first of all try or talk about one of the simplest requirements.
Unwinding start in the last function, in the chain and then comes back.
The first representation.
Here in unlike hill climbing, we allow a bad state.
For example, I say that there was a movie where Shahrukh Khan, Deepika was there, and that parsi actor also was there.
That addition is to be removed then it gets this one.
We don't need to do it.
The new state is now free B okay because you have placed A on the table so that on BA on AB is gone.
So, in in this case the first two level, the second level, the third level, first level, the third level and the fifth level and so on I'll be invoking MiniMax algorithm.
And it is so you can see minus one you explored where one is three, other one is four.
okay so on and till the last one and remember, total values are M okay .
So, in in that case you can see that this place on table A is relevant.
So, won't prepare that dinner Okay .
So you'll have to figure out which position is better over the other and give marks accordingly so the the value accordingly.
I what I do is I pick up a root node, explore all children of it, next level explore all children of those children and so and so forth that is the Breadth-first search.
And if you if you remember the the thing that we have discussed, the interface of an expert system also quite different than conventional systems.
The solution could have gone in different direction, pick up the fourth step.
but the idea is really good, but still it is criticized.
So, that that is possible.
The first one is project planning.
Same three, zero, two, four, four and six.
Okay .
So if you're trying all possible alternatives, you can make the decision.
And the components are very simple design, obviously, because it doesn't do much - spraying pheromone, calculating value of pheromone and deciding.
Okay , so we’ll be talking about them.
Remember nearest neighbor also was a very good algorithm.
Here, why it is called partially mapped crossover?
It’ll give you a good solution, but not optimal solution. Branch and bound on the other hand will give you yes, optimal solution.
We know that the same parent, same city cannot be revisited, so we are ignoring them, we are cutting them off. Okay .
The issue is, that if you run the program again it’ll pick up some other random point and start travelling towards goal state again.
One is ant colony optimization, the other one is called branch and bound and the third one that we are going to look at is called refinement search.
For example, when your king is under attack, or when there is a fork, possibility of fork.
What does that mean?
Here you do one more thing.
if not we’ll pick up the third sequence and so on, so forth.
We start from A then explore and okay what are the trees, what are the cities possible to be reached?
So that is the third rule.
So, both things are used.
Because there are lot of people saying one thing, lot of other researchers saying absolutely the other, Okay .
Look at what it returns.
So, multiple statements having Ram loves Sita, Ram found Sita loving and so on so forth can be represented using a single statement.
A on table is added and because A is resting on B, okay A is resting on B, B B becomes free.
For example, a KE would say that what are the decisions that you make.
So, because we allow the bad state you need to have this best so far.
So that and number of cannibals also are reduced.
When there are no possibility of applying any rules, we can’t move further.
So, for example, ‘Sachin took a taxi to reach Boriwali’ or ‘Sachin reached Boriwali by taxi’ or ‘Sachin picked up a cab to Boriwali’.
So total amount of milk is less than 5 gallons.
The simplest of hill climbing you don’t do that.
What I can do is I can use a an action called place on top or place on table and use that and once I do that the prerequisite is done.
In in case of heuristic, value being more in in in the later cases its called hill climbing.
Solution is about moving across state space.
But we choose rule number one .
If you if you get that right, yes everything else becomes easy but unless you get that it’s it’s it's pretty hard.
The first case is one, the second case is one.
So when you talk about entry conditions, they are conditions that must be satisfied for invocation of that state.
The third step obviously goes ahead and calls the MiniMax for its children.
So, this expert system, while you’re designing knowledge representation process, you are not going to store the knowledge in different forms, please understand.
So, the M two, remember the original number of missionaries on the right hand side were M two.
So that what does that mean?
Earlier case was different, okay .
Now, this is something which is heuristic.
So that pheromone value is based on the distance also.
In case number one, it is impossible to to do something like that in in the milk jug problem.
So I will have E here in child one at place number one, Okay .
So, this is exactly what I have on the right side.
That's the power and that's the usefulness of beam search because here you don't have time to go back.
Okay , this is the current state and we say minus on CD that is on CD is place on top additions okay that is the only addition that we have.
The next slide talks about the same.
Probably some of you may not be able to read and understand the third representation better than the second one.
Single point crossover is not possible here. Okay .
Two.
And how have I done it?
The output units will be five or six.
We cannot proceed further.
So once you get the right tour, the job is done.
But then there are two issues.
There are four components in the start state four components in the goal state but then two of them C on top of D and D on top of table is already achieved in the final state.
How the right reason from the statement can only be derived if you learn about Abdul’s plans and his goals and all that.
How do you decide that this user this user is to be blocked?
Now, this is an important advantage of escaping from local minima.
If this value is better, make this a current state and best so far is new state.
Okay
With that we’ll conclude.
Now this is comparatively much more readable .
So over might return, come back when we reach the six ply.
One particular student implemented this to shortlist a resume in his company there are five thousand odd resumes coming in daily and what they need are bunch of experts who could look at those resumes and and filter people whom they can interview and it’s a expensive process.
It it what what the heuristic function take as an input?
Now this is a cycle .
This is a move .
We are going to define these are the tasks and these are the tasks which and this is the order for this task.
Say, cannot move.
So, you you use one heuristic function for example, you use one heuristic function which uses value four for parent and three and two for children.
So the child one remember, is going to pick up the part from parent two so B, G, A parent two, middle part is copied into child one.
Okay , so in the child.
They say that, it is impossible for such a network to even differentiate between the values which are exoar .
A human brain can easily do it, can deal with this incomplete fuzzy things and so and so forth, but conventional computer programs couldn’t do it.
Prototype construction begins with knowledge acquisition.
We have one more state which is called a final state.
Acceptable! And number of missionaries and number of cannibals on either side of the river.
Nothing bad about, nothing wrong about that.
You know such programs were just impossible a few years back.
In some other cases people use minus one to one where any real value between minus one to one is acceptable. In our case minus ten to ten usually integer values are acceptable other values are not acceptable.
And that is the reason why this depth-first iterative deepening is is used with chess.
I'm exploring one branch and I may also be exploring one more branch.
Remember NodeInfo is a structure which we are going to define later.
And it is quite good.
I just choose six,zero,two Okay .
Now you can see that it is not as straightforward as the previous case but it’s still be able to solve because we have picked up a very trivial, very simple, very easy problem to solve.
So, there are some issues with CD and next module we’ll be talking about an extension which Schank himself proposed called scripts which which which actually removes one of the problems with CD but then there are other problems.
Because, experts will have to look at all those resumes.
We are not going to discuss that thing right now.
It shows that J equal to zero to N.
So, Ram is doing something.
What we have seen in this module?
The point is all these things are assumed to be part of it and script is something which which represents this expectancy driven scenario Okay .
Multi layer module means that network contains more than one module, more than one layer, okay .
Now, I I want in in the final state C is on the table.
It says that on the left hand side, M one minus some M value, number of missionaries are there and C three minus C cannibals are there and R M two plus M.
So, here you can see that C is resting on top of D and B is resting on top of A in in case of a goal state and there are two possibilities, there's do two things that you can do you can place B on the table or you can place C on the table and you chose to do the first the second one placing C on the table.
Okay It’s basically a recursive algorithm.
You can, but then when you write rules, how you define a state space ?
We have already seen in in a typical case of depth bound depth-first search where the depth is just one is called depth depth-first iterative deepening search.
The actor acting on that object.
How the pheromone values are?
So whenever there is no node to explore you cannot go further and there is no end, there is no this thing road ahead.
Now let us look at the next level.
But even in this case, how many moves that we can write is going to be substantial.
So we’ll not choose components which does not have much of an effect.
Will be discussing about this in more depth in the next module.
So you can look at that and decide.
Suppose if you are interested and this is a real world example, suppose you want to write a password cracker and what you are doing is you’re just checking each each password.
Basically temperature describes or determines the amount of bad moves to be allowed, okay .
And again, they may not be the same in in all cases, okay .
why I've got this much of salary?
But this is a basic primitive thing that you must understand.
In fact, best first search you have three different types of nodes.
So, this is the strategy and based on that we’ll define heuristics and based on these heuristics, the static evaluation function characteristics, we’ll decide the value of a state and you can see these are multiple there are multiple components and even with such a simple case there are more than one five-six components for the heuristic value.
Okay , breath is again taking air in.
Okay , let us start talking about the the abstract, the first primitive, okay .
In fact , you can see that this is the initial state while this is the final state .
Best first, remember the word best first means that we’re only exploring best nodes , Okay .
So better thing is choose the function on demand.
Now, you may be surprised why the first cycle is repeated again.
The difference is not much.
Let us see what that is.
First, how to write this function?
So the algorithm , the back-propagation algorithm is all about processing like this.
We’d begin with a state with heuristic value minus three.
How will I represent a move ?
You are able to work in a in with a partial information.
There is some similarity with simulated annealing as well.
They generate solutions,
Suppose I am going to sit with somebody who is going to who is an expert of intrusion, he'll start talking about everything that's happening intrusion and I'll have to learn and one of the very, very important outcome is to note down the jargon used in.
We need to have some strategy to move around in state space and there are some characteristics of that strategy also.
Okay
In In conventional methods what we do is, you pick up a solution state, look at the heuristic value and then try move to some other solution space with solution state which is better.
Because it is past tense.
It is two way dependency.
If you want to write a general purpose chess player, it would be very difficult because here the search strategies and heuristic functions are specifically designed to address this guy, Gary Kasparov.
Every road is is possible to travel in both directions, okay that’s a reverse path is the same path.
So, it is A to Z that means twenty six, okay .
So, there are two components and we can pick up the shortest tour based on addition of this two components, okay .
In In case here as well ACO as I said it is will ant will not always use the path with highest pheromone value but the probability is higher okay .
A MiniMax algorithm works like that and we are going to look at the algorithm the very algorithm in this particular module.
You can see that it is not part of the goal state in So, both conditions are satisfied.
Okay so, that's the only difference, otherwise it's it’s the same okay .
‘Forget’ is exactly opposite to it, something which was part of the long term memory is gone out, hear, tell, okay and so on, so forth.
So this is how you get the child one.
Again you can see that is quite similar to the state that we have seen before.
So, W and B are not preferred in by many authors.
So, let me again brief.
As I said the GA is not the usual content for AI this thing .
Call is made when you reach to the final this thing and then unwinding phase starts.
We cannot because this this particular node has lesser heuristic value.
Okay , you can see P indicating past tense, Okay .
And then there are others also.
So those Constraint Satisfaction part uses that test, so it is generating and testing them.
So, the first layer of weight is called W one, the second layer of weight is called W two.
They plan that way.
In the middle part, you you should try to use as many M as possible, which is legally allowed.
That's one reason.
How it is doing we will see.
Here also T well decide T suppose for example, we are solving a problem and then we use one annealing schedule with T value is reducing with one and then we'll use with one typical way of reduction weíll use some other way and so on and we'll find out which works better for that problem and we'll use that okay .
So, technically it is sound enough.
It’s a little different than the normal general script.
And there are cases which which requires more for example, more elaborate representation.
So, A or E one of them must be zero because farmer will use one .
But is it so that the script is not relevant?
Action is described by this primitive and many times it is called ACT or action.
So, this is what it does.
So, again, three-prong structure is used.
Think of chess you will we’ll not be able to do that, but for these trivial cases you can actually do it.
We have also seen goal state planning where it solves everything at the problem component by component and then every component once every component is solved, it’ll check for the final that thing and if it is solved, it is so.
And H appears at position the last but one in parent one, so it is copied there in the child one.
How do we know?
We have an initial state, we have a final state, we need to move around around in the state space and that is what we call a search, Okay . A method.
You have minus three, then minus five, minus two and three are the children.
So, this is what it it should do.
So from every node, every city you have a distance to every other city.
So, if you have six units you can have total sixty four possible output.
It is pretty simple and can also be be used in embedded devices, IoT devices and many other devices, which which doesn’t have the the power or computation power or memory to process all all these. Okay .
So but you can see that the the the rule description D and three prong structure with one source the other one destination and the object on which this this thing is happening.
You will have to also design implementation steps.
So, the representation right now uses a placeholder called Do and he's doing something.
So why?
So,that final for example,I drank soda or slurped it.
In case of positively misclassified case, what has happened?
People say it is the worst thing, but then they did the same thing with experts and they they have found to be between sixty two to sixty five.
So, all those things are involved which is not represented here. okay .
Okay .
First thing, we need a data structure for storing the state.
And a good designer of script can actually assume all possible cases, those scenes which might probably occur and all that and keep them there.
So it could do it but otherwise it believe me it's going to be hard.
It says if farmer is on the right side Fx and Ch cannot be on the left side okay and Ch and grain also cannot be on the left side.
What does that mean?
In in the slide, you will see that there is an additional value one which is provided, w one one, w two one, w three one, w n one.
Okay , so, that’s something which is very different from a computer program, computer system, and and human brain.
For example, if I get a pay slip, I hardly ever go in fact, I never have and I I’ve not seen others go and ask the clerk.
It’s a huge company and a lot of resumes used to come and they have to have huge bunch of experts to look at those resumes and and shortlist resumes for further processing.
We will also see something called variable neighbourhood descent, which is again little different, which actually is better for solution search which which we have just seen last in the last module.
So this is what is is is is represented the word, whenever the word like read or or listen, for example, or hear or whatever of that type, okay .
Now, that's the heuristic.
We we will not fix things unless and until it is a must.
When I'm talking about Ramlal or somebody, a greater than average, that average, that height is little lesser, okay .
Now, how you solve this problem?
If search path is going beyond that minimum value, it terminates that itself there and refinement search which acts over a solution space and and does exactly the same as branch and bound.
But if I I know there's a only few places
Remember why it is the decrement because you are picking up a worst state.
Okay .
So that is again an example of how you can derive meaning out of this thing.
I've talked about some verbs myself, now you can find a few more.
In in one way, we have already done like for example missionary cannibal problem you start from three, three, zero, zero then move along and at the end you get zero, zero, three, three.
And once we go through all this, you probably would realize how important it is.
So, L number of output units.
For example, color of skin and all that are almost similar.
okay What about this state?
the fox and the chicken or the chicken and grain.
Now, the second thing that we’ll have to once we have looked at those primitives, which can represent actions or verbs into those primitives.
Now you can see is is something quite similar in the next slide.
The process is the same.
So, you have Milkha Singh and double arrow PTRANS.
The case where you already these two are dead end. okay We can't proceed further.
So, testing is comparatively more difficult.
But, empirically it is proved that in most cases you get them.
You see that is a darkened narrow, one sided arrow.
Okay , a particular sequence which may be the right answer to this missionary cannibal problem.
And that is what I want my program to do actually, if I want to write an AI program.
In in case of annealing schedule it says that if the temperature is this you will have to do this. If temperature is this, you will have to do this.
There are total ten is to ten neurons in the brain and total ten is to fourteen interconnections, that mean, there are almost one thousand connections from a neuron to other neurons.
Some of the components of the initial state space does not exist in the final one and some of the one which exists in final one does not exist in the start one.
So, this context determines the meaning of a statement which we are not talking about.
Okay if we we'll we’ll let our study about heuristic we'll have some idea how we can choose one move out of most.
Now there is an automated cook service, Okay , which Jay enters all this information into his system.
So, that's why that is very needed.
Otherwise, we’ll go back to the second step.
So, that is the first thing, the no no algorithm issue.
Building a state space is what we have seen in last two modules, but that’s not enough.
Here we allow with a probability P.
Many, many search problems which otherwise are not possible to be solved and that's why it's become a very, very popular algorithm, as I said.
L M one C one and R M two C two and B L what does that mean?
In in We have seen two cases in one case we have looked at missionary cannibal problem the other case we have looked at farmer, fox, chicken grain problem.
that is better because the current architecture has multi core, is called multi core architecture where you have computers with multiple CPUs in in in real sense.
Both methods are used in factors.
The meaning of the statement appears in in in the representation and interestingly because meaning is represented, it becomes very easy for somebody to infer from it, something which otherwise is just not possible.
Why P?
It is possible but it is not possible in this case,
Now he everything cricket stadium and playing cricket and all that is there in these two statements but actually watching a match does not happen here.
You’re actually you start with minus three then zero then two then four. You reach to four.
Now, that probably requires some more explanation.
How can we solve this problem?
The issue is synchronization.
okay but...and in some cases it is player one and player two as well.
You will have to reduce the summation.
We used two components, one which is an actual distance.
A GA obviously is based on one simple principle which Darwin gave long back; survival of the fittest.
So, that is is something which is more readable .
How good is that method?
There are many similar things.
Thus the discussion becomes a little more complex but the same, okay .
Either children list is emty, there is no children okay what could be the case?
Another sequence node two, another sequence node three and so and so forth.
What what does that mean ? That you shouldn’t have cycles that you should be moving further.
What and we have already seen they leave pheromone trails and decide and all that and there are a lot of variations to this basic algorithm exist.
Basically, this module is about extending our discussion on CD that we are talking about, how syntactic rules can be used to construct CD representation of the natural statement.
So this is a Sparse neighbourhood. Okay , Anyway .
Now, every entity involved in a statement has some role to play and this role is represented by this conceptual role that we talk about.
So, if that is the case, you will have a look for and get that, actually once he gets this thing , he will meet expert and then try to make sure that expert understands whether he has learned that thing.
Sometimes you say, you find a little bit better statement like Sachin flew to Los Angeles from Mumbai.
Which one should I choose?
So if I'm I'm using a small number of nodes as an average number of nodes that you produce, number of children that you produce its called Sparse neighbourhood.
Anyway, but when you find that the script is appropriate, you have immense advantage of using them.
And if if you have a serious detailed script, which the example that I gave is not one, very simple one just use for pedagogy purpose.
Okay and when I want to when I went to watch a match, obviously, I'm interested in viewing a match and I have that money, kind of Okay .
So, so if fox is on the left hand side, B is two.
I'm using a body part, so MOVE is also involved.
It can be any.
So after few iterations probably the solutions that you have are better than the earlier ones. Okay .
For example, I go to restaurant, obviously, I have two have two entry conditions.
So, the addition is this okay on CD.
Usually, there is an alpha release as well which is circulated the company only and people who are using that product in the company will come back and give you their feedback.
So, those things are the first two things that usually the KE would like to have.
Three plies, only three levels in game the level of tree is called ply. It is eighteen into twenty into twenty for twenty being a branch factor, look at the value I can't read that.
3,5,0 which is already explored is a parent basically of the same node and 6,2,0 is the other one.
The top one is max that is we are playing.
And for Tic Tac Toe let us look at some of the characteristics.
So that's precisely what we say we disallow six, twelve and fourteen.
For example, when we are talking about water jug problem, we think that the water is available.
You've seen problems with the scripts, we have seen aa fleeting scripts, we have seen how appropriate scripts can improve your reasoning. We have also seen some latest aa im improvements in this representation.
If we if you have a move which can provide something called threat of fork.
if your heuristic function is good enough and you're choosing the best moves, then you're going to save a lot of memory as well as computing power and you will be able to complete the this thing in time.
You may invite and you may run both things together because the customer wants it.
You can't write algorithm.
Now, you're also going to add us a policy enforcer.
Those pheromone values are indicators for others.
So, that is something is a component which is part of the goal state.
If it is not, the plan is not valid.
Then W plus now, you talk about the next input.
They could concentrate more on more better resumes and it could result into fast far better short-listing process.
And there are events like reading menu and ordering and and eating and paying the bills and so on, so forth happening.
Manoj gave him the chocolate.’
General purpose would be almost impossible because it has to be generic.
It will pick up random parents and generate that thing , it combine them okay .
And we have already seen that, that how the script can be invoked.
And the third option is simple - Ask the user, what is Epicurean?
In our character recognition case, the N value is eight- one okay .
It just combines Y plus Z, obviously the the middle jug in that case will contain no milk .
Friends, welcome to the Seventeenth module of AI .
I have reached to D.
How it is done?
So let us let us look at this.
After that you start the development process, okay , the basic framework in inference engine is decided, user interface is decided and core knowledge base is constructed, new class, rules everything, now is written implemented, the test data is inserted and start any ancillary part that is required is also added to this, okay , and testing and all that is required.
And when cycle appears the rest of the elements are picked up from the other parent and copied.
In fact, GA has shown that it can actually solve some serious AI problems not sorted for years.
Delta is the difference between the objective function value of the current state and the new state, okay .
Okay , and and and when you talk about MTRANS , information comes from various sources.
For example, I have parent one as A, C, B, D, E, F, G and parent two as C, D, B, G, A, E, F Okay and I decide that I use the middle three elements, in the case number one, the parent one is B, D, E, parent two is B, G, A Okay .
The ppt is is talking about this four three gallon jug problem, two rules one is specific and the other one is general, the eight five three gallon milk jug, again there is a specific and a general rule and also a state space representation .
If the slope is like this, if slope is more steep than the earlier case, little change in a way it will increase the output much further.
If anything less than that, what’s the point?
So, when I'm suggesting something, probing something as an expert, why should I be doing it?
The algorithm works like this.
The other method you just get all solutions, okay and pick up the best solution, refine that solution, okay , pick up the solution.
So, word love is used in many forms, but basically the meaning out of this is that Ram loves Sita is is the essence of the statement and that is basically represented.
The number of missionaries on the left hand side must be greater than number of cannibals on the left hand side or number of missionaries are zero.
Not only highest it is more than the collective value of everybody else.
Okay . You reached to four you can’t move further, Okay that’s that’s called local maxima, Okay .
In our case, it is It’ll Here I've taken L.
It can come down but the problem is that if it comes down, there's a threat from the the rook.
For example, when you say that ‘Sachin bought a bat’ there is a concept called ‘store involved.’
So if, even if I explore, that node will give me ten is of no use.
That means that in the initial run avoid all moves which moves missionary on the other side.
So, that is again very critical point here in the implementation.
Look closely at this representation.
But the other one when you apply the second rule, the state that we get has value two so we move to two.
Knowledge representation scheme also is to be provided in big detail and provide clear cut idea about how and how the knowledge is represented and how it is inferred and so on and so forth.
We begin with 8,0,0.
So, the biggest advantage of CD is that such things are represented using the same structure.
B represent fox and fox value is two.
One epoch is said to be over.
But a more important thing is, I must have some clear means of telling which move is better.
So, this is something which is about prerequisite.
It is not easy in fact, you probably have heard about a robot which makes pizza but that's the only thing that robot can do and only if everything is stacked exactly for his requirement .
This is about beginning from an initial state, move around in state space and stop when any one of the goal states is reached .
So, more number of samples.
So, every A contain eighty one inputs.
Look at the second figure and look at the data which is generated from that figure.
Now, every input, every input of A will be nine into nine, total eighty one we’ll use okay .
Now, watching a match he has to be there in the stadium and and to travel by bus he has to be there on on the bus stand.
You can see that it connects an action action with an actor okay .
Okay you know that it is quite true for us as well.
Once this is done, then the actual processing of algorithm starts from now on, because now we have some value of pheromone set for all segments.
The corresponding element of B here is A.
So this is precisely what I'm doing.
Ant colony optimization is a very popular algorithm some time back, is still being used, but not to the extent used to be.
So, we’ll take the right child of 3,5,0 and we get one.
So pheromone value is some constant value divided by the length.
Again let me repeat.
The other one ‘Sachin did not’, in fact, the negation part, ‘going to a restaurant.
Row is the constant rate by which it is decremented.
Okay , one example here is is is given the handout is that when we go out to dine, we expect it to be a restaurant, obviously.
Now, we decide the objective function value of the resultant state after applying this rule what we get is a worse state than this, okay .
And there is something called virtual infinity.
And this is something which is there in humans as well.
That's what the state space representation.
On BC so you have on A table, on D table, on C D on BC.
As I said in last ten years, how many times you asked for and how many times you were successful?
But then there is a problem.
Second o ne, A dot deletion, A dot deletion again you take an intersection with goal state.
And if it is found, the the match we'll store in the usable database.
We have also looked at the Alpha and Beta cutoff at the end of this this module.
And other stakeholders are also invited, because you're not going to code.
I've not written how to move around in state space, how you choose value of variables and all that like A B C D is are the variables that we've used.
So this is how you represent the state space .
Okay now let us summarize what we need as as components.
okay The reason okay of Ravan’s health going to minus ten is this.okay .
So, testing is to be done from that angle and that's why it is different than conventional system and you should also make sure that what will happen if the decision is wrong okay .
For example, Sachin is clever, that clever is an attribute of Sachin.
Otherwise, you can just forget, it is better.
Well, we see genetic algorithms are very good at those kind of problems where you have to apply perturbation search, Okay .
If there is a cycle you’re not moving further, you're circulating at the same place.
There's a problem which is possible to be solved but then we don't have programs which can play table tennis.
That is altogether a different thing.
So, throw is little more complex, point is there there is a if there is a verb, which indicates physical transformation of any object, you will have to have PTRANS into that representation.
Now, it is quite possible and when when the speaker begins with a phrase or two, it is possible that the meaning of statement is possibly in three different directions.
There are lot of things here that you need to know.
But it's very critical that you you use that structure because it offers one of the biggest advantage of reusability.
Not only that Next to next also is empty.
And we have looked at some of the components like positional importance of the node we have seen, because that is to be considered in SEF .
If If you can combine both of them in your representation, that’s the best.
In most cases that will solve your problem. The next slide talks about how hidden unit learns to be active.
And how you do that?
So, what you could do is, you can say that the pheromone value for the next segment next period is equal to older pheromone value multiplied by one minus row.
The other point which I talked about threat of fork which is shown in the next slide, you can see that.
The the ATRANS , abstract transfer actually, it talks about mental control actually, the the control or or or ownership or position transfer.
Okay , but the third one even human reader cannot get what it is.
We are we are going to learn about how CD representation can be actually used to convert a statement into that representation.
We already seen one more method of binding it to a typical length and it’s called depth bound depth-first search.
If a progression is relevant, it is actually moving in the right direction.
That means multiply both of them and take a square root of it.
Here it is if you write general, it is going to be very hard.
But obviously, this is different.
So what we have?
So what a translator program will do is explore all these three branches together .
It is basically decided by this plausible move generator.
So, here also we have inputs, the inputs are x1 to xn and there are weights, weights are w1 to wn, okay .
So, Sachin moves himself and object is Sachin himself.
No, no, no, this is not what we wanted. Even in that case, you get a very, very strong feedback on what is not wanted.
And so that you must conclude that Jay has done something to reach from stadium to the bus station, Okay .
Not only that, because it is more recent also, because it's travelling faster it is more recent, number of pheromone also is more.
what I do is I I'll just mingle them in a way that or in a way that I generate new nodes out of it.
So some value is decremented okay over over the period of time plus whatever is added by newly new ants which travels down that path.
But then, if you provide friend’s image, you should say friend and it says the other one, the other one is provided, says friend, these are the examples of misclassification.
All explored nodes are kept in the other area.
Now, try to understand.
When I apply maximum, I get the same answer.
Whenever you explore a node, whenever you generate children for a node what if the child is already explored.
Now the the first condition done, but the other one A is resting on top of B okay that becomes when you put A on the table, A is resting on B becomes false.
And what does that mean? That means that it is ten, it is win for us, the problem is solved, Okay .
One is variable descent neighbourhood method where you use different neighbourhood functions which let you determine number of children for a given state.
Now let us look at the next method called Depth-first search or DFS.
If farmer is on the left hand side he cannot be on the right hand side.
You can see that it is it is not difficult to understand how it operates.
And why it is there?
We have discussed last four steps of expert system design process.
You can say that farmer is on A side, fox is on B side chicken is on C side and grain is on D okay .
When you say throw, what does that mean?
So, you need to group rank and order your knowledge, you need to find out missing points in that knowledge, you you will have to remove redundant and unnecessary part from the knowledge.
If I also include zeros and ones, I’ll have I need thirty six outputs.
With a branching factor of thirty five chess is an example, at level number one you have thirty five.
What is addition?
Why?
That is done many times in in in CD .
So, PTRANS talks about changing of location.
Now, you may believe that it’s almost the same.
Now, if you want to find out the cost to reach to that city, you can assume that that cost in the final tour, that city is connected to two nearest neighbors okay .
To select some you may use a function, which is quite similar to heuristic function but here it is called a fitness function.
Now, you can see that the same relationship and the object is Ravan.
So we can get a tour with lowest value.
Okay , so those are preconditions or entry conditions they are something called props which are the objects involved in this here it is tickets and seat and match and so on so forth.
But here in this case, two is the best node, so we’ll explore two.
But then there is some difference here, okay .
So temperature value is reduced .
That nodes here it shows that dark nodes are either repeated or something which are already explored. Okay .
And it unless it cannot find a food source it is not going to come back.
We’ll use sigmoid function sigmoid function is used here.
Interestingly, two of my students implemented neural networks for a very different cases.
So, whoever initiates the process, whoever is is the actor, is associated with this particular association, this this particular the primitive, okay , okay .
For example, let us again take chess.
It talks about the meaning the statement carries, and we'll be looking at that particular part in this particular module.
So, that is it.
Okay let us let us see that.
In fact, branch and bound can be combined with any search algorithm, even we have taken the case of finding the shortest route between two cities.
Now let us pick up second one, G.
Welcome friends!
So, this is represented this way.
For example, I gave the example like Sachin gave his bat to Sarfaraz, the ownership is transferred from Sachin to Sarfaraz.
In this particular module, we're going to look at the remaining four of them.
For example, Milkha Singh ran is is Milkha Singh and PTRANS and the object is himself.
But you can change that slope here and there, to improve the speed and and let the algorithm solve the problem in faster, sometime that is needed.
So, that's the simplest type of planning.
And there is an example shown in the next slide.
They they take the lower part of the obstacle, the upper part of the obstacle.
Y is less than or equal to five.
The third one is called Cyclic crossover.
Not only it is complex to write rules, it is also complex sometimes to write the prerequisites of the rule.
Not only that, this is also useful for exploring in real time.
But the important part is to bring the chicken back.
So experts will have to look at only five hundred resumes and out of which they may figure out that this fifty are good or hundred are good or hundred and twenty are good.
He used that and most of the other books also and other representations where I've seen, they are like that.
We believe that the measurement that we are getting now we are very good now.
If we use the same string surprisingly both children comes out to be the same.
We have already seen.
There's path one and path two.
Remember the higher value of T will let you move to a worse state with more probability than less.
Now expert obviously has given his knowledge.
You, This If you use only that single layer of perceptron it cannot or perceptron or neural network, it cannot.
But let us again pick up a problem like chess and it’s it's becomes impossible for us to get an answer.
Whatever we have done so far is called Path Representation.
You can see that and I I I bold face them to make sure that you have understand.
Okay .
So, that that is something which is different in CD and interestingly because of that different statements with the same meaning will have same representation in in conceptual that's one of the strengths of CD and there are some how it is done actually?
Okay , so that's the problem.
So this kind of representation is called State Space representation.
At the end we'll see that there is something which is possible to be applied to this, which improves our search process and the next module we'll we'll see that thing in a little more detail.
As I said, it is cheating and is not desirable.
simulated annealing, we allow bad move, okay .
So, what is the solution?
If it is more than whatever you you can fill the the the three gallon jug and whatever is remaining is there in the five gallon jug.
Sometimes people say it’s a case of common sense but common sense believe me my friend is very, very uncommon .
Right now we have no clue.
There are many factors which determines whether, this one very raw factor is called piece advantage the number of pieces that I have, compared to number of pieces the opponent has.
If I I can make sure that my knight is in a place which threat of fork to the opponent can capture an important piece of the opponent like Queen, I have an advantage.
Plausible move generator is assumed here.
So what you do is you use a C, they they are being used okay .
Fox is on the right hand side, F will be two but then both of them cannot be two.
It is not very similar to something that we have studied so far.
Take huge amount of time if I use a lot of components that demands SEF to be optimal.
D is not free because there is something else called X resting on it.
For example, there is there is something called zero zero. Let us begin.
In the next module, we’ll be looking at how these particular simpler forms can be combined into representing complex statements.
So, you may write a program to do it.
With that we’ll conclude.
So, that's the case.
The example was of a predicate we’ll study about predicates later but when when I say L F FR L basically is an example of a predicate.
So, and we start with remember we start with the final one and eventually because it is a stack you pick up the top then it is the first action to be applied, apply that action to start state, change the state.
That is applied in chess and many other cases many times.
The capacity of the X is eight.
So in the beginning we’ll use just this and calculate.
Now you can see that what we are talking about is almost hill climbing, otherwise best so far is current node.
clears throat Okay .
This could have been a a five hundred into five hundred or five thousand into five thousand pixel image where there is a signature.
This figure actually talks about.
Now we do not explore all the nodes, we only explore the leftmost.
So, there is an arrow which indicates so.
And as I said, such connections are plenty, on an average one thousand connections.
Because it works with the search tree where you have alternate layers of min and max layers.
They are they are doing something else.
You can see that it is not dependent on MTRANS.
The direction towards LA from where we don't really know but it says that Sachin PTRANS himself in the direction of LA from somewhere okay .
It is not, fine, go go further.
Now, this is also is very important component for generating a component for SEF .
In fact, there's not one problem.
So this is what GA is all about.
And you can see there are three things in in PDDL as I said there are three components of PDDL three things: preconditions, additions and deletions.
Thank you.
So, it's basically an algorithm.
So, this is a relevant regression.
We say that, the state space is is represented by X Y Z where X plus Y plus Z is eight.
There is an action, there is an actor, there is an object and so on so forth.
And the next three columns actually describe the rule applied, number of missionaries moving on the right hand side, number of cannibals moving on the right hand side.
Sometimes people call it only a refinement .
Whenever a statement is presented CD representation, the first job to convert that into CD representation is to derive meaning out of that statement and once the meaning is derived, that thing, okay , is represented.
Now let let us learn little more about human genome.
This method is useless .
So that is if that is very similar to hill climbing if if you reach to a place where it is impossible to apply any rule, a dead end, provide best so far.
And we have to use valid moves as I said.
What we do is something very different.
What does this artificial neuron do?
Okay so based on that answer that he has got or if you travel back you can say that because he was late and could not see the toss, Okay .
So, once that part is done, why we are doing that thing?
So, that is one upon one plus E raised to minus summation and the summation we've already seen okay .
Because game tree you cannot explore completely, based on the time available or whatever you you just stop somewhere in the middle.
Now an important thing happens.
B says it as minus five is not very good for us, C seven is far better, D is three and E is minus one.
Now you are writing the classes.
Three integers, simplest of representation of this particular problem.
The the actual case all spaces, suppose for example you have twenty solutions,
Now, the first one is A.
We’re going to have a quantitative representation of goodness of the state.
Okay , for example, when I say, Milkha Singh PTRANS , it’s called a single conceptualization, when we talked about predicate logic, Okay , we we used a structure and we call that thing a predicate, here we call that thing as as a conceptualization.
I start with the first element and put it there.
For example, one example that is given in in the handout says, Sachin gave his bat to Sarfaraz.
The mental information is being transmitted, okay , for example, let us take a verb called ‘Remember’,
One is three four gallon water jug problem.
It begins with the first element, Okay .
Now what those values are?
And obviously, only those deer who who run fast and smell better can survive.
Okay . These these type of search where if we don’t have any help from heuristic, we don’t have any domain knowledge, we don’t have any information about which move is better compared to others, we call it Unguided Search.
I can solve it but can a computer program do it?
Pick up the temperature value T from the annealing schedule.
The next one is called GRASP, which is which has very clear meaning, so you don't need to worry more about GRASP, GRASP is picking up something holding it.
I'm not going to talk about that because little more complex and more confusing, please understand that these are simple primitives and you can order them in multiple ways to represent the same meaning.
This is the limitation of the language itself.
One of the disadvantages here a single statement representing basically a a a sequence of things.
So I don't need to describe the entire rule once again, but you can see that it is the same.
Now try to understand what this mean.
how better how much they are, the quantitative representation, they'll not be able to give but here we’re thinking that way.
It has only two options left - left and right.
Number of missionaries are more than number of cannibals is not allowed.
Toh , these are the differences; on A table and on B; this is what we want to achieve.
We have seen how scripts are used in representing statements which represent complete scenarios and not a single statement here.
And I am going to use them in this crossover method.
okay , now let us jump into little jargon.
It belongs to a a a specific class you just run some testing, measurements and letter.
okay .
Some authors describe the layer at the end.
And the CD representation look pretty pretty superficial on the face of it.
In this module we are going to see some other search methods, little better methods of searching.
Okay .
what the content of that sample, Okay and it tries to figure out, Okay .
Can you write a program to do it?
It is very good rule six, it’s not solution but then there are no possible rules to be applied.
So, it's basically a recursive process. And that's the reason why stack is used.
If A is positive, E has to be negative.
Let us look at the state space.
Axon connects itself to dendrites of other neurons.
Again, you can see that the word ‘attack’ is not represented as collection of primitives.
In In case of a A to B it is two twenty and A to D is two twenty-plus two fifty plus one fifty.
Anyway so let us see what this particular rule is doing.
So ATTEND is, ATTEND is attaching your sensing organ or attending your se.. se.. sensing organ to something which is coming from outside.
Offspring inherit genes and attributes and then this thing the process produces next generation and once you get the new generation the old generation is just wiped off,
But then we don't need to.
Okay Now what we are trying to stress here?
We’ll be discussing about conceptual dependency.
The static evolution function requires two things, current state as well as player.
But the, here there is one more word which I'll have to use.
So, a four gallon water jug will have two gallons of water at the end.
We are pouring either the milk in five gallon jug or three gallon jug.
We are talking about missionary cannibal problem and something.
This is again an example where back propagation algorithm is used.
The fourth rule- We pick up an example of Sachin went to LA.
If you only consider uppercase, thirty-six uppercase plus the digits and fifty-two when you consider upper lowercase and together.
So, this is these are the initial and final state.
And second , sometimes when you don't have heuristic, but the problem domain is small enough, you can go for Unguided Search Methods as well .
Same way in other domains, okay so, there are some symptoms, which tells you that there is something wrong.
If I have my piece can move to a center where I have better control, I have an advantage.
I I want that less than twenty-two if something is more than that the path is of no interest to me.
That also is perfectly valid because that also is acceptable acceptable in literature.
That's all.
A heuristic for this particular problem can be something like this.
So, it won’t remain at as attractive as possible as as it it should be after a while.
And once again we get 5,0,3 which is already explored before.
okay The algorithm we have designed returns two things.
If you avoid eighteen moves for example, the entire eighteen sub trees are pruned from the search tree.
One was again done by Schank and all that.
You have to have some values constraints on those values here.
Now, let me repeat what I'm talking about.
So zero zero to three zero is impossible.
In that case, in most cases you have to re-run the program.
okay Functional description of each module this module is going to do that, okay , objectives and the problems, okay , objectives and the challenges of every every module that you will are going to work on.
It is max so I'll the player is playing.
And in this case, the exploration seems fruitless because eventually I get all four of my children having value N, looks quite similar but it is in true sense, they are not.
Now here again unlike the other case, where we call it heuristic function this is called objective function.
He enjoyed playing cricket with his friend there.’
How much to reduce?
Now how you that threatened, you can see that there is no statement like that, no indication of threat but it can still do it.
So, it is possible to have multiple initial and final states.
So, total summation is calculated the same way one upon one plus E raised to two minus some is calculated which you can see on the screen.
L and N again, he chooses L and N and D again, he chooses N, N and L, N and N and N and D and there's no win yet.
So these are all unguided methods.
Now, what what set of motivational strategies would will be able to actually retain the employees.
Now this is not all that simple because what you are planning to do is to solve on BA first.
Whenever these three features exist.
What I'm going to talk about is how one can represent a statement in a CD form.
Remember x zero is not an input, it is a value one and w zero is minus threshold value.
Prototype is first thing.
You don't require expert for it.
What are the deletions?
An expert actually verbalizing in this verbalizing his knowledge in this process.
If it is better go ahead.
That that's a problem, okay .
But then if you do that, you will find that it is phi.
The left hand side we had M one.
Slow if you continue , if you do that process in a slow manner , the problem is that it takes a lot of time.
You just pick up next city from the list of cities.
So, other side you cannot have that okay .
Everybody every other city than A.
For example, why Jay asked who won the the toss can be answered in two ways.
And this is the example of the integer values that I was talking about.
Okay with a third case for first two human reader can easily get Okay , how to get that thing in in the program computer program is a hard job.
And we have also seen how one can assign values to those variables and so on so forth to make sure that you you start from initial state and reach to the final state, applying various preconditions, checking various preconditions and make sure that the rule applied in a valid manner.
So, that simplifies our description.
Here it is shown as tau T plus one.
A spectrometer reading and there is something called mass resonance spectrometer reading.
3,5,0 can be converted to 0,5,3.
Generate new state by applying next rule, no rules left.
knowledge engineers learn the basic idea about the domain, also learn how expert processes the knowledge, how it stores that knowledge, what is good and bad about this system, what to concern about, where to focus more and so on and so forth he learns.
Surprising? We are doing it in fact.
So if you if you’ve used verb like pick pick up, hold and all that, if you want to represent them using CD , you will use GRASP as as the the primitive.
A dot preconditions so preconditions this is how you get the previous state.
Now, that is not good, you're going away.
you can see on the slide that you have one typical position on the left hand side, one typical position on the right hand side and just show that the move is characterized by having the position of the pieces here which is shown on the left hand side and the the result of the move is something that you have it on the right hand side.
So they are in true sense to be represented in CD form.
You you cannot explore the entire level further but you can explore that node further.
I have already told you the mutation is a process of adding serious randomness, it is very different when compared to this thing .
And you can see that the Epicurean problem that I talked about, now if you have a right ontology which clearly indicates that Epicurean is is type of a restaurant, reasoning can be pretty easy. Okay .
But if if you try depth bound search and if if if there is a password, which is of four character or five character and if you’re if you're just exploring probably you’ll be able to crack it better, because it takes otherwise it takes much more time.
We we have looked at one very simple method of characterizing AI problems called state space representation.
We’ll skip that thing for a while.
So, These are shown on the slide.
First thing - It is possible to have multiple representations for the same problem.
How can you represent cry?
okay When Schank has provided his his own as I said, you can come out and have your own primitives.
okay , so static evaluation function is a very good, very important thing, fundamental thing for game playing.
Toh , the summation suppose if I want to calculate noise the sum that is happening at H one how it is calculated is shown in the next slide.
In that case, level number one is one, level number two is thirty five, level number three is thirty five into thirty five .
So in case of exploring only first five is a sparse neighbourhood case, exploring twenty is little more dense , exploring ninety is really dense .
L Fr fx ch and Gr - farmer, fox, chicken and grain, all four of them on the left hand side.
So what we have is this.
We’ll we’ll or you will have to look at previous statements or next statement to figure out what that ‘Do’ is.
They learn from their own experience. It’s very similar to us.
So in the case, the leftmost case, we have two outputs - L one is N the other is N.
So, there are multiple initial, multiple final states possible in in other problems.
The sigma does what?
And if there is a problem with memory you cannot do that, so we’ll have to repeat that again.
With that we’ll conclude.
Try to understand.
You will have to decide program logic for this.
Now can you tell me whether the action is relevant or not?
In the goal state if you see goal state A is on the table in the initial state it is not on the table.
Okay and the second part of it says that if the farmer is on sorry the farmer is on the left hand side, you can’t have the same combination on the right hand side, okay .
For example, in our case, we can do but think of a a case of chess.
So, that kind of an alternate path is if provided in the script, one can even reason with that and can clearly conclude that dining does not happen and obviously payment also does not happen.
And you will have to also identify sources like what are the sources of knowledge.
If they cannot understand, you probably will need to modify.
Now when you provide this cutoff and minimizing level, it is called alpha cutoff.
Otherwise, it can be a first move, can be the third move, can be the fifth move , so, what's the current state?
Now this is called Breadth first search.
I’m testing everything for a solution.
You don't invoke that script.
So, it you can write this thing as w one one, w one two, w one three and w one and so on.
One more You can even add one more.
So, goal stack planning is one method of planning.
So, it it it calculates it that way.
These are called motivational strategies.
So that's usually the constraint.
So, these are assumptions .
How?
Because as I said if you execute everything, remove all difference, it is quite possible due to side effect some other differences are not executed. So, once again you look at that goal.
Okay quite exaggerating.
Again let us see the same thing.
That’s a problem.
Ram did something to to kill Ravan.
Okay , waiters and menu and everything is added, Okay .
Now if the question is asked why Jay asked who won the toss?
Well, let us start.
Because of that the ordinal representation makes it faster.
So that's something that the system has to do when it’s working with scripts like this, Okay .
Now I've already got five which is very good.
You can see that the second slide that the hidden unit which learn to active and there is an horizontal line, also learns to be active and there is I and there is H.
Now you can see this example.
Remember, if you explore more promising paths first, it is better for us because we'll be able to eliminate the paths which are non-optimal, okay .
Okay C plus G is four again the same logic.
Now you probably see this graph and wonder what is N because I just said win lose and drawn and why N?
Okay , so when you use this variable neighbourhood descent and why it is called descent, please understand.
So, it does a simple thing.
We have already seen how a problem can be represented using a state space and move around in state space and so on so forth.
Don’t ask me further, I don’t know.
Suppose, if I I’m here and I have five different moves from this I’ll apply this function to all of them.
There are hundred, almost infinite number of other ways to represent this problem.
So this is what is known as steepest ascent hill climbing.
And initially it it was considered to be a very good thing unless somebody found there was a guy called Minsky who found that however good this neural networks are, they are incapable of solving some problems, which are we which he called non -linearly separable problems.
State space representation means, I'm defining all states using the simple formula.
How the this ants find the food source and then retain that?
And to maximize the crystal size of solid this thing , there is something called the annealing schedule which is followed.
But then when you use this script the appropriate script you can reason like nothing before.
Now look at the four prerequisites again .
So, that heuristic value of one cell where we have the value and other two are empty is better, has higher heuristic value than a cell where we occupy that thing and two others are occupied by opponent.
What are the advantages of this representation?
For example, Garry Kasparov, the Deep Blue machine which IBM build which has beaten Garry Kasparov three-two if you remember there it was there in news for quite some time.
Sometimes the expectation is that user expects you to explain its reason, which is not there in a conventional system.
If I say any two I'll have again much more.
For a large expert system, it’s pretty critical.
Frame is a very simple structure, a script is comparatively more complex.
No, there is some difference.
So, this one zero to n only includes the ants which travelled along that path and no other ants.
Remember we have discussed about solution space in the earlier modules.
Well, there is something similar available but is not basically heuristic function, something very, very different.
Let us pickup something called a Tra...Travelling salesman problem.
We'll look at the other problem called farmer fox chicken grain problem and precisely what we are trying to address here is is called multiple representation of the same problem.
It says , and we are only using a three integer vector value X, Y and Z.
So B mapped to B, B is mapped to G and A is mapped to E, Okay .
But that may not be true if M one is zero.
These are three things happening, Okay .
So, that means M missionaries and C cannibals moving from left hand side to right hand side.
You don't have time.
Minus five, two, minus one and two are yet to be explored .
So that is one thing which we do not want .
The program actually indicated that there is possibly a similar reason here.
The same thing is used by similar thing is used by the programs, okay .
So, if it does not recognize you just change, continuously change those weights, eventually it will converge into that set and you may ask me, if you ask me, what’s the guarantee that you have.
You can see that that the third unit learns to become active and there is the other line.
I'm not going to play C.
Here the computers use electromagnetic waves you know .
In the other one, order crossover method we we copy some part of the parent into a child and the rest is filled up from the other parent based on the order in which this thing appear in the in the parent itself.
Again, explore the next level and so and so. We explore tree, level by level and see if they get a solution.
you can see on the screen, its too huge a number.
L three three, R zero zero.
Okay , so I do not want to say that this is the list.
We have looked at back propagation algorithm and this is all the this is prerequisite to back propagation algorithm.
Let us begin talking about this thing .
But then in in rather chess its not all that good an example.
For example, in case of G, okay , you also have here you have a horizontal line.
This path is obviously longer than one that I’ve already found.
Saving is not these moves, but then the entire search trees which are generated by those moves.
What are the essential ingredients?
So, the every line has two components, xi and wi.
Because it is already explored.
Out of all possible cases you get converged to the best path and once you start getting such paths obviously, you will be able to get the right tour okay .
The first problem.
These two things are laugh coming inside as as as an input to Dendral and what Dendral does?
Now, that knowledge is to be be be completely modeled into a computer program that KE and developer is is the communication is pretty, pretty critical here and it constructs actually a lot of other important outcome.
Or when I travel by bus and so on, so forth.
So, you take a square root of it is nearly twenty two.
It's very similar to human chess player.
The the case number two and three also indicates the players movement okay .
Now, I know that this difference because this is not C is not on the table and I want it to be on the table.
So, that something is represented as Do.
So, there's no point exploring it and the other reason is that, I have minus three already see I'm a player, I have B and C.
Minimum level, minimum value of the children is passed up.
Sometimes it is not the object but instrument.
Their work they are working in a coordinated way and the pheromone value is an indicator, the the tool which they use for coordination here, okay .
Second, we'd like to avoid defeat if I I don't get to a state which help me win, I’ll I’ll try to pick up a state where I can avoid defeat okay .
But if if you can think of a clever idea, the presentation becomes much simpler.
How do you decide that this packet requires deep inspection?
That means total amount of milk that we can have is eight.
If you use heuristic you become guided.
It was designed to make sure that Gary’s this thing the moves can be thwarted.
So, here there is an additional memory provided ontological memory and obviously it has the other memory called episodic memory which is almost the same as scripts.
Now suppose you have five outgoing possible lines.
Okay and this is a small thing contribute to larger structure, that’s the great thing about CD .
And now let us see what the next two lines describe.
And the example is something that we've seen in the previous module. Milkha Singh ran, okay .
We could have applied rule number nine eight six etc.
Variable neighbourhood descent is little different type of an algorithm.
So it's possible for somebody to write rules for it?
So, that’s one example.
So what does that mean? I I I’m given a chess board position, I apply that heuristic function, that heuristic function will give you give me a value between minus ten and ten.
What does that mean?
We have seen the basic building structure of conceptual dependency, we looked at different primitives.
In this module we'll be looking at the MiniMax algorithm.
Let's see what how can I write the state space and this is going to be much more complex than the previous case, little more complex, okay .
But then, later on researchers found that it if you want to get a if you have a very, very complex figure, where a feature itself is made up of other features, what you need is, multiple layers.
You can see that now, two is the best this thing .
We are not going to lose any our game there.
I'll have to back the values up.
Similarly, H zero also indicate the W zero, in that case H zero, the second layer, okay .
We’re looking at just all nodes, Okay .
The subscripts that we are using here, one one to n, okay .
Minus nine is worse than my minus three.
So, this is basically the process.
So, we are going to discuss about them.
So, what you do is you apply some other function which gives parent say five , but then two children seven and nine then you can pick up nine.
How can you represent anything of that sort?
Okay , we'll be looking at the rules which are used to represent different shades, different types of statements.
So what we do?
Where Y plus Z is less than three. Total amount of milk in Y and Z is less than three, then what you can do is you can pour everything in in in this , the the three gallon jug.
It is the opponent king is the king is under attack.
It is not about starting from start state to go to final state, no.
Now, in the beginning you may feel that the problem is almost the same as the previous one.
But these are the basic building lob blocks of CD .
So if you if you give some human being this problem to solve, probably he will be able to do it in few minutes.
That's that's their primary source, that’s primary job to do.
What we do is we just write some sequence of random states, Okay and call that thing as node one.
CD is kind of a structure where you have all verbs listed and there is a form available.
You may be surprised why should we talk about Unguided Search as we have already seen that most of the AI problems require heuristics and this Unguided Search Methods don't use.
And that actually the search also has a pretty big disadvantage as well.
How important is is a combination of knight and rook and something like that.
And static evaluation function is not the one thing. There are there are multiple components involved in it.
That is why it is allowed in GAs .
More components means more time and Deep Blue in conventional cases could explore six seven plies and sometimes fifteen to twenty plies and in that case think of a number of nodes that you will have to apply the static evaluation function to.
So this is how Depth Bound Depth-first search is is executed.
Ten indicates winning, minus ten indicates losing.
In fact if I say that, any any city exchanged with any other city then I am going to have around three sixty.
Remember, the static evaluation function or heuristic, is only an estimate and I have just played my own move, I have not seen what opponent is up to.
Because knowledge is updated in one place, the other place is not and you have a problem, the whole chaotic situation derives out of this problem.
There are basically two different types of search methods.
Now, once you have that information, you can understand that he probably has flown from Mumbai to LA, so that Mumbai the the earlier representation, the the starting point is a question mark and when the next statement is encountered, the starting point becomes Mumbai, so that's something which CD can do, in fact and that question mark, you can see is is an example of a conceptual tense. There is…for example you if you encounter a statement, if you drive rash, there is more chances of meeting with an accident.
So for everyone you are actually calculating.
So, here we have three inputs, three hidden or middle layer units and two output.
Will what we have seen in this particular module?
For example, you decide the limit of your search say is three.
So this is the slide actually talks about one example, fingerprint.
We start with that.
There are some description about that as well which is not part of our this thing .
Control strategy decides which rule to apply next.
Obviously, because fox and grain cannot do any harm to any other.
Then and then the state is valid, otherwise the state is not valid.
It is also possible.
okay .
So mutation is kind of a bad move
You won’t get further; if there is a mutation probably there is escape route possible.
Now we start along some other path.
So, that is a little better compared to the other one. C is as good as A because only one option, the top most row is possible for us to fill.
But that you don't need to check like the earlier case not and all that is just gone, why?
In case of best first, you can even pick up three.
King is under attack but queen cannot help.
So first example is comparatively sparse than the second one, okay . Why sparse neighbourhood to be used?
It It It moves to and fro and it’s not going directly to the the solution.
Okay . Apply heuristic function, see which one is better.
In metallurgy when the new alloys are made, they are melted at high temperature and they are allowed to cool down in a controlled manner.
The GA is based on the principle that living how living forms continue to become better to to make sure that they they they adjust with the environment.
Why A at the end?
There is no thumb rule for it.
L zero zero zero zero and R one two four eight .
Let us take a simpler example. It’s not all that simple, but comparatively simpler example of playing chess.
We start with 8,0,0, 3,5,0, 5,0,3 Okay .
For example, in chess, there is something called a threat of fork which we are going to see later or center control or or degree of freedom okay , how free our piece is to move around.
So, 5,0,3 will take our left child which is 8,0,0, next child 0,5,3, next child is 5,3,0. Okay .
The weights of each the each of these important things how important threat of fork is, how important center control is based on which some quantification is made and you get those values.
So, this way, eventually you will be able to get an optimal path from any node to any node and this is precisely what we want.
In this module we are going to talk about a typical method which is used to handle most of the AI problems.
First of all, it generates and then test .
And now we are also stating what are number of missionaries and cannibals, okay , and so on and so forth.
I've talked about the primitives which are most commonly used and represented but you can see that this is one view and please understand that this is Schank’s view.
and if if you do it that way, out of five you can generate twenty more.
We’ve already seen that there is possibility of using something called blind search methods like kit generation test, breadth-first search, depth-first search to handle the search problem.
For a serious case, you have a lot of other information, for example, it involves events like tossing and lunch and and tea and all that in a cricket match and also about the sequence in which order this happens, the toss happens in the beginning and then only then the match starts, and then you have innings, and there is a lunch break, and there is a tea break and so on so forth.
If you play chess, you know what I'm talking about.
So, that that is probably the meaning that you get out of that.
We’ve already seen AI is trying to solve difficult problems and difficult means is something that is hard for computer to solve, not humans.
Let me tell you, No Why?
Okay so it has all all data about Garry Kasparov, all with the the amount of moves and all that and so on and so forth.
At the third player itself you have reached to a dead end.
It is very simple, it pickup the any city at random, it pick up the first city at random and that is the city.
So if you want, if you are interested in studying more about GA probably those are the references, in fact there are pretty more, in fact there are many, many more resources on GA .
If it is possible for us to apply this action now and the action should convert a state into some other state where something which was there in the final state in the previous state should not be there if it is not there in the start state. And something which is not there in the start state in the goal state, it should be removed and something which is there in the start state should be added okay .
And now, let us talk about a few complex cases where these rules are combined into representing a statement. .
Those primitives are simple primitives and any language, any statement can be represented using that statement.
The system can actually use all combinations of all these approaches.
okay So when we reach there what should I be doing?
For example, when I'm dealing with this most trivials of problems, we have some implicit assumptions.
So to reach to D this is the minimum bound okay .
So, when you talk about representing fly, you have few other things rather than additional, in addition to be PTRANS .
Some other authors have shown some other way, but basically the algorithm is same, which is the same thing which we have studied in the previous module, we want to describe MiniMax algorithm in nutshell it's the the same thing which we have done.
The speed and again the decision is to be taken, the processing is has to be pretty fast.
In many cases, the the recursive process is invoked just because of that unwinding part being done in this simplified manner.
So, when the total is six, that means only farmer only fox and chicken is there on the right side, which we do not want .
So it is possible to use GA this way.
Every unit learns to pick up this feature and learn to become active.
Welcome friends to twenty first module of AI .
You may try.
First, not all rules are used.
So, that is again the second one, the second condition which is satisfied.
I’m trying for a state, my my pockets is one state.
And what are the operations that you will have?
Only farmer can row the boat, obviously grain and fox and chicken cannot.
And there are many candidate structures.
So, many a times you need to again sync between expert, knowledge engineer and the user but then I’ll give you at least that feedback.
okay . And the genome in human case is a long stand of estimated thirty five thousand DNAs in humans.
So it it it directs the behavior in successful directions and inhibits unsuccessful directions.
If you're an expert, you're going to provide your rules, the heuristic rules.
We don't want that.
Now, the earlier Ravan was dead because Ram did that.
That’ll add a lot of chaotic things, okay .
We have zero, this is better, so we move there, then minus one, not good, two, better, go there, four, we’re moving along quite nice, Okay , four.
Sometime you stuck up, okay .
We are also telling that Sachin not only went to LA, but he used a plane for his movement.
So they are part of the unexplored nodes.
Some presentation again, there are two things which I'm trying to talk about.
So, there are more than one things involved.
So that's what precisely it is doing?
So, what does ant do?
It is possible to have multiple hidden layers.
You can see that this is done if you put on table A then you get this on A table and then place on top BA you get on A on BA and once you do that you can test everything and you will get them.
One hidden layer The idea of having a hidden layer is to provide some means of finding out features of the input.
You can see there are five different cases.
Now we go further and find out the actual distance.
okay .
If missionaries are two, cannibal is zero.
Anyway, so let us Okay . The second thing, when a rule is applied , there is something which should change the state. The current state is X.
So, anything multiplied by zero will be zero, so, xi wi case all xi is where the xi value is zero, wi does not make any contribution to the summation.
So, we get that okay .
We are not looking at anything else.
Neuron’s memory is pretty less, it store very few things.
Now, here this is actually a subset of depth bound.
When you deliberating over where to move and there is a sudden obstacle, you'll have to take an immediate left movement or something
So, that's called the direction relationship.
The actual distance is obviously more than what we are assuming here.
I should be written in two things.
For example, throw is is a verb.
But that is all a very very common thing.
So that we cannot generalize, so we are not talking about, we just assume that PMG exists, will generate nodes for us, so that is assumed .
But , the problem with these methods that is going to enter into entangled into something called combinatorial explosion.
The Ordinal Representation actually allows single point crossover which was not possible in path representation.
So when we encounter a statement, Jay want went to watch a cricket match P is replaced by Jay Okay .
They make decision based on that local information which they have and each component, each ant is going to decide its path on its own and many ants work together, okay , for food source and when some of them find the food source, others will tend to follow this path and after some time they converge on that path.
I’ll have to learn what are false positives, what are false negatives, we’ll have to learn them.
Toh static evaluation function in chess is based on two different components - The rho obviously based on the original value, original capability of that piece to move around and capture other pieces and the positional.
M one greater than or equal to C one, M one equal to zero or M one M two is greater than C two or M two equal to zero and M one plus M two equal to three C one plus C two plus equal to.
Why?
Now we take the right child of 8 , Okay .
Obviously, what we want to do is to save the king leave everything, else be sacrificed for it.
So, out of that B is a better move.
Propel means applying physical force to the object, okay .
And whenever you encounter a statement, which probably contains many simple things about the world, those things are collected together, represented as a collection in in conceptual dependency, and in fact that is the great thing so there are thirteen total primitives, eleven plus then one was added later and and one more.
Chicken is four.
This is a harder problem but we only have two moves.
B is mapping to B, D is mapping to G, E is mapping to A.
Okay and we have few examples, I watched a match, what does that mean?
okay the the it’s going to be played by the opponent.
When fox and chicken, fox value is two ,chicken value is four total becomes six.
How you combine two strings?
Evaluation of a system is also done here.
We have not written a function over, we assumed a function called over.
For example, the person would say a lot of false negatives, uhlot a lot of false positives and those things.
It it it is not something which can be used to represent any any any statement that comes across and give you exact solution to that problem.
It’s not going to help us much we need a little more precise information for which we’ll use we use SEF Static Evaluation Functions and static evaluation function are applied on a state and gives us the merit of that state based on some range that we provide.
There is no feedback whether it is right or wrong.
It's Sachin is going from somewhere, we don't know where, we have just the statement, does not have the information that from where Sachin has started but we know that where Sachin has landed, Los Angeles.
For example, if the only farmer can row the boat and when the farmer is around nothing wrong is going to happen.
And then M one plus M M two is three and C one plus C two is also three.
You can see that you begin with all farmer, fox, chicken, grain on the left hand side and so on.
So for this, you again, insert one more goal called free D and for that probably you require one more action called place place on table X okay so which removes X from on top of D and place it on table.
Same way, D and E.
See the process.
Because an an action remember we use that word action now, we don't use word rules we call action, that action for action you have to have a prerequisite.
Because you know that this trail the for example, you lost yourself in a jungle, you you you’ll travel on a trail which is which is there, you know that this people have walked on this and that's why there is a trail.
Then you have an object what what is the object for M trance? match, Okay .
So the preconditions that you use should use M equal to zero.
You meet your friend after many years and he has grown in all dimensions but you’ll still be able to recognize him.
They are quite different from each other. Okay .
I am moving three gallons of milk from eight gallon water jug into the three gallon water jug. And 3,2,3 moving three gallons of milk from five gallon jug into the three gallon jug.
C on top of D is it part of the start state?
Okay .
So if you use nearest neighbor algorithm to find one path and then travel other paths and see if it if they are going beyond that nearest neighbors skip them.
Okay , the next one is Sachin gave his bat to Sarfaraz, I I won't talk about this.
The the value, the which comes next the suffix, zero one that value indicates which input unit to which output unit.
Now we are talking about pouring milk in 5 gallon jug.
We have an initial state, we have a final state, we move around in state space so and so forth.
N and D then you choose N not D.
One which talks about the tour cost which is already incurred.
For example, if I have two consecutive cells occupied and the third one is empty, it’s a very good thing, I I can just play the next move there and I’ll I’ll win so is that also a very good state.
So, they thought, that let us try to see how human brain does it and they worked on it and they tried they tried to mimic the working or functioning of human brain into computer programs.
Okay , let us look at this figure.
so It's basically an alternate thing.
But when you will choose when you switch over from the the sparse neighbourhood to dense neighbourhood.
For example, take a case of finding out who the person is.
Testing is done by something of Constraint Satisfaction.
The same way, there are ants coming back from E, okay , because F is a food source.
And it is quite fault tolerant.
So the the programmer program itself can reason from it.
Does something else.
Which out of which this two which one is relevant?
Point is, is a huge distributed interconnected dynamic structure.
If the summation is beyond a threshold value, a typical threshold value, it outputs one otherwise it output zero.
In fact I I won't return with without doing a process.
The simplest of hill climbing you apply one of the rules, look at what you get and that node if that node has a better value you just move there.
We’ll start all over again.
There are many other notations used there is no standard about this.
Same boat is available which can carry only two items.
Though all of them are cricket matches and most of the things remain same. There is some difference.
If it is the case, you say that the progression is relevant otherwise not.
You try you try for class I, then class II, then class III, then class IV.
We looked at conceptual roles, tenses and how a statement can be represented using CD .
For a simple reason that would like to avoid unnecessary calculation of moves.
An example, I I when I'm pushing something, I'm propelling, but the direction is opposite to me, when I'm pulling, I’m again propelling but the direction is different, you can see that and this is something which I was constantly trying to talk about since the beginning,that these are primitives, a very simple forms form of representation which can actually represent multiple , many, many verbs together.
So, you have those values differentiated that way.
So, wi xi is is going beyond a point you output one otherwise you output zero.
The idea is about using a very small tiny agent with very little information, little processing power but able to do things which are unable to do by many other things, very, very simple solutions which are parallel.
These are indications, okay , these are symptoms of something which is wrong.
So, you can see that verb called ‘shot’ is represented like this.
Mini, Why it is called MiniMax?
Okay , now let us see you using the formulae that we have used to see if this is relevant.
and not only that.
The annealing schedule determines the amount of worst moves to be allowed okay .
In fact, one of my PhD student did exactly that.
So, this simple method of spraying pheromone value and let it evaporate over time actually decides a path which is, I found recent, because the pheromone value, if it is old will evaporate, and second most preferred by others, because more ants travel along the path more pheromone value.
For example, when you encounter raining and match abandoned kind of a thing then obviously viewing does not happen or happy or sad, obviously you are sad because you can't watch so you you can understand that thing Okay ?
Now, there are two things happening – ‘terrorists attacking Mumbai.’
And again, whenever appropriate script is invoked it can predict things which which are not mentioned.
This rule number six we are talking about a case where there is something which is happening, and it is using something else as the instrument for doing it.
We'll soon see how that happens and basically is depth limited.
So, basically, we are incrementing number of missionaries and cannibals on the left hand side and decrementing from the right hand side, the rest is the same.
So we’ll choose the child with highest heuristic value that’s why it’s called steepest ascent.
Obviously, there are no algorithms here.
Let us see.
And there are two other examples.
We have already looked at genetic algorithms.
It's called ‘After the match gets over Jay went to his friend's house.’
We can pour the water out of the jug.
That's all the pretty simple.
Eight thousand is not all that large if you if you look at the complexity of chess.
You may worry or you may query that , what's the difference between branch and bound and nearest neighbor.
Where ABCD belongs to LR.
So we are we are yet to fill the four positions.
For example, when I am coming for college, I am looking for my car keys.
That's the reason why I would like to explore the search tree as deep as possible.
That is the important problem.
This is called tour.
okay so new twenty, now new twenty is pick up five and throw everything.
So, Sachin has actually moved from somewhere to LA.You can see that.
So, we have two jugs.
Now it has two arguments X and Y.
And one great thing about GA is that it can handle the combinatorial explosion problem, Okay .
For example, when I say that X Ram shot Shyam, for example, now here when you represent that in CD , it it represents it in a way that Ram used some weapon which shot a bullet, which enters into Shyam’s body, so this thing is actually represented.
Okay , so all these push and pull and and throw and kick, all of them can be represented using this propel, okay .
For example, I'm viewing a cricket match.
One more important thing here is called Mutation which we are not going to apply in our we are not going to discuss further in this module.
For example, a manoeuvering program in chess probably looks at a million states during the the the chess playing session.
And then eight and then ten, Okay .
It invariably finds the shortest path. That's the first thing.
There is a guy who is administering administering everything, an administrator.
Number of missionaries and number of cannibals.
So, with that probability we are jumping to that node otherwise not. Okay .
They are not same.
So, the programmer has to just convert, map this thing into that programming syntax.
Many most of the vision and audio related information is stored that way.
What are the advantages of this method?
So, it’s is a single structure which contain actually the essence of multiple scripts, Okay .
Please understand.
Number of output units depends on number of outputs that you would like to classify.
Now at in this phase, expert system, whatever expert believes it to be we his rules, processing got a lot of rules of thumb about everything and all that is understood by knowledge engineer and recorded.
Are there any restrictions?
Now we again run that thing, find out the complete search tree, and then decide the next move.
You cannot.
There was only one unit which is input, there’s one unit which is output.
So that is the meaning of this particular rule.
Okay .
Fr is on the left hand side at L Fx fox is on the left hand side, at L Ch, Ch is also on the left side.
So, we again > go back to our trivial problems that we have seen in the second module and we are going to explore them little further here and we'll see how one can apply these strategies.
We’ll see in the next module how exactly back propagation is going to solve the problem but this even the algorithm we’ll look at the complete algorithm in the next module.
The search tree is explored with every move that we take.
Okay , and you can see that there is some similarity with frames.
It is coming out of eyes and where they are going, doesn't make any sense here.
The pheromone evaporates at constant speed and the ants are capable to smell the pheromone value and so on so forth and tends to follow the path with the strongest pheromone value and and I've already told you that it it depends on two things - more ants travelling on that path where number of the amount of pheromone is more and the path is more recent the value is more.
So what is the outcome?
We have M one missionary C one missionaries on the left side, M two missionaries and C two cannibals on the right side and either boat is on the left side or right side.
In here the simulated annealing, the random moves are allowed in the beginning and almost disallow them in the final one.
And I've travelled A to B, B to C, C to D, and at that point of time, it goes beyond Thirty five, it is it becomes Forty.
okay .
So there are two components which are used.
Okay , so conceptual tenses past is P, future is F, negation is slash start of a trans transition is TS Okay .
That should be non-phi but it is phi.
So what we have the best node on the top.
So, remember what is to be deleted - something with start state and not in the end state, that is to be deleted.
So, those values are like fuzzy logic values, depends on context.
Please accept such things, okay , because expert systems are almost always designed this way.
So, it will do it that way.
In the second step we’ll evaluate those states.
okay so That also is indicator and that indicator is important for us here because at alternate layers, we are picking up either maximum or minimum values.
Now, that is my initial state.
So, that the next rule it says X Y Z, Y plus Z greater than or equal to five , you have X five though this is completely full.
Now you you like to learn about them.
So B is copied.
With this we’ll come to an end of this module.
Okay , smoke is ingesting, the smoke inside the lungs. Okay .
I have already talked about that in the first module, let us talk about that again.
For example, there are actors, so Sachin gave his bat to Sarfaraz then Sachin is an actor and and the ATRANS is is is the primitive now, that Sachin and ATRANS have some relation, that relation is to be like written and that is called dependency.
In the initial run bad moves are allowed almost with equal probability as of the good move but later on it is almost zero.
How will you code them?
Okay .
If I have this function I can just apply to a state and get that value and get that value between minus ten and ten and I’ll look at all possible alternatives.
Now, this information is to be provided to the back propagation neural network.
It is possible that sometimes even a piece a pawn has more value than a queen, sometimes okay .
If it is a goal state, quit.
But okay its our our choice of words basically, otherwise its same.
okay , Such things, when do you do?
Suppose if I design a heuristic function for Farmer Fox Chicken Grain problem for this, assume that there is a function exist.
You can ask for the color of the tail of the cat or ask for the hat the tennis player is wearing and the the computer program looking at the image can answer you.
Neural network, also we use small neurons, which can work together to solve complex problems.
You surveilling something, okay , then something is happening and you will have to take an action based on it.
Every level increases number of nodes exponentially and that’s the problem with this approach.
Now D, so the corresponding element of D in parent two is H.
May Maybe one more way of doing it is to pick up something which is not used before, okay , some rare kind of a step.
We find out the fitness function value.
Okay , so there's one more thing as I said people from different domain use different words.
You can see that there is no mention of dining, there's no mention of eating and so on.
The the default form of square doesn’t actually do it.
And if you know that the opponent is fond of doing it, make sure that you you keep a component there in in in your static evaluation function which avoid steps where the opponent can get to something like this.
We don’t have the value ten.
So, based on such information, we can provide heuristic value.
You can see that it is there are some pixels which are on, there are pixels which are not on.
I know that in the beginning I have to send two cannibals on the other side, I did that.
You just pick up a solution and see if it is so and in in hill climbing you actually pick up the better state. Okay .
But there are multiple ways you can use this algorithm and there is some similarity between ACO and the other things that we have seen.
BFS and DFS will find solution eventually if the search space is finite.
Then let the solutions combine, merge together and generate new solutions.
When we are talking about recombination, we are talking about combining parents in a way that they inherit almost everything from parent.
So, this is something that we do not want.
Now let us look at the other case.
If it is not, it will add the component which is not solved again.
What we want to have is, two gallons of water in a four-gallon water jug.
Regression is exactly opposite.
The same summation is calculated but then what you have is one upon one plus e raise to minus sum , you just calculate it that way, it is there shown on the screen that you you better see that yourself, okay , so this is called sigmoid function.
Level number two you have thirty five into thirty five I mean, thirty six in the earlier node.
Sometimes people call on..on.. only in addition to any algorithm.
Because remember, we have done something in the goal-state planning, we have learned that it is quite possible when you add a new task, you are testing for malaria, you may do something which fails the test of typhoid that you do earlier.
Okay , now let us try to understand what the problem is.
There is one example shown in the slide, you better see.
So that, the whatever we study here is going to be useful there as well.
Let me recap this this is part is pretty important.
So, that is also mentioned.
If you if you do it only once, that's a problem.
Because, just assume I have four different children, so for first child I'd calculate this value, a second child I get some value, third for I get some fourth also.
So, for example, I assume that for correct image, the output should be one and I get one.
okay , you can see that the state's evaluator, the next slide talks about that thing and we’ll label it in either of the three cases – win, lose and draw and you can see that they are already done.
So, what are the values of those Hiccup those X, Y and Z?
It’s kind of a generalized representation of a statement and it's quite similar too, if if you have some idea about how Unix works or Linux works.
What should it be?
CD is another method of knowledge representation like Semantic net and other methods that we've seen so far.
And that was an expert system which is being used in commercial domain.
There is something called Soft Computing.
We need an additional thing in solving an AI problem called search .
It just looks from all possible state states that you can generate, we will only choose some of them, we will not choose all, will choose only few and plausible better moves compared to others.
We just state that for progression, it should the move the action should make the state more relevant for the final state and less for the start state, exactly opposite while you come back.
For example, five children of the same parent, same pair of parent are very different from each other.
Now this is only about one source, one destination and you will have to do this for all destinations and from those destinations to all other nodes.
Expert utilization is given the highest priority.
Okay last three requirements.
In sigmoid, will continuously increase because if you want to get one actually, it is sigmoid will output value between zero and one.
We will just see that soon.
And when you invoke that script, the complete information available in that script is inserted into the representation.
So, that's precisely what is happening here.
So the call here is is current state zero current player.
So, if that exists then this structure cannot be the the the real one, so that is eliminated.
I do not want to highlight the other part of how to represent a statement in a very, very complex way.
okay When we look at the function I'll again remind you that place.
So, there are some parts of the script we have already seen, the first one is entry conditions.
So that is the earlier case plus the decrement.
The primary job the the job of an ant is to find the food source, nothing else.
In this case, the first level you have one node, second level you have two, next level you have four.
C grain, not grain S chicken, not chicken D is grain, not grain, okay .
But then, CD is not the panacea.
Okay .
But believe me, in when you write the program, the program may try futile paths and probably be embarking on the right path.
For example, how the navigator represents the problem itself moving across ?
So the process is to like to go to the goal state as near to goal state as possible and once we reach to the nearest possible case, we apply static evaluation function, see what it offers and based on that we find out what the parent offer and parent to parent and all that.
Now you know, there are multiple solutions and you prefer better solution.
So, you say that Milkha Singh PTRANS himself, okay .
So, again out of that five you pick up first five and so on.
It has some small set of system calls sixty three and any command that you type actually is converted to some form, some combination of those system calls to get the job done.
Okay , let us try to understand the process which it derived from.
Now, it clearly indicates that six,zero,two is better than others.
Genome contains something called chromosomes.
So, that is one of the very, very important part of prototype, this thing and expert and knowledge engineer sit together and do lot of things.
You you just try in that direction, could not solve the problem, come back and try some other direction, that is quite possible.
So, there are a few thumbs of rule, the knowledge segment should be as small as possible and they should contain knowledge chunks in a way that conventional law of cohesion and coupling is maintained.
It says noding for NF, is a new node which is defined, NF.Path is equal to NULL Now, why the path is null?
So, you can use one which suits you.
Here I have shown one example of again I'll pick up our own eight five three gallon water jug problem and I've shown how two paths are explored in parallel.
So there are some ways of telling which moves are better compared to others.
We have not provided any logic for it. Okay , suppose we have a choice.
So, the the very statement does not contain anything about bullet or gun or something but but the representation contains them.
And logic also is required, how how who changes that?
For example, one is PTRANS because the location of stone is changing.
The the algorithm, it begins with generate a random node from a state space.
So here it it’s very similar to human being or even living forms.
You just say that current state is the start state.
I have already told you in the beginning that GA is quite complex so everything that we are talking right now is basically the simplest thing that we can talk about but in true sense it is it may be pretty complex. Okay .
But anyway, the final, once you do this, you'll have to test whether the plan is perfect or not.
If it is not, we can run in parallel, you can start.
And suppose, if my heuristic function says that eight,zero,zero's heuristic value is minus five; six,zero,two is five; three,five,zero is three and three, two, three is four.
If after a move, I have the peace advantage I’ll more number of pieces than the opponent has, I have a piece advantage.
On CD is a precondition for the action okay place on top CD.
Now, you can see that, what does that mean?
There has to be it has to model the the thinking model of the opponent and then match with it and that's going to be very, very hard.
In a nutshell, it it is defined like this.
If missionary is zero cannibal can be one or two, okay clears nose .
Now, that is some something  else which we are not discussing right now, but Constraint Satisfaction also is pretty simple to understand.
And empty i,j j minus one, in fact that's the next block.
The basic approach is also decided whether you will use goal-directed reasoning or forward reasoning or whether you will use inference at this place or not, and so on so forth.
So I'll start exploring the other route.
So, that’s precisely what we've done in this chapter in this module.
So, all in all, we are going to see how heuristic function is applied in in other search methods.
And and in fact, when you represent concept like love, the same thing probably would happen, you may say that that something happened which makes the mental state equal to ten or something.
We’ve cheated actually and just instructed the program to choose rule number one .
There are in in other words there are three layers of inputs but two layers of weights.
We are going to look at a particular version of that algorithm in in a pseudo code form to understand it clearly.
What does it do?
You can see that other two things are already done C is on top of D it’s already there and D top of table.
Okay , and the the rule number five also talks about statement that we’ve looked at in the previous module.
Okay .
It's also possible for you to answer question based on this cause effect relationship because this is precisely what scripts are talking about.
So, it's basically the first step in the development process.
That's point which I wanted to stress.
I’ve already told you, when you explore a search tree or a graph, the difference between search tree and a graph is, a a graph will a child will have a point that is quite possible that will also point to a parent.
So this is an example of how you can use scripts to get answers using this cause effect relationship and there is one problem.
And what we do is we just apply kind of a generate and test.
Sometimes, all all possible combinations are entered in the goal stack and you try using all of them and get the best out of it, that also is possible.
For example, one more capability of gene gene is to make sure that you you will have some characteristic for example ability to climb trees and swim and so on.
And otherwise the M one minus M, now total number of missionaries on the left hand side is zero then it is fine.
W two zero one means the weight between the zeroth or the first hidden unit to the output unit one, remember.
But it is assumed to be there.
You can also write a formula.
Now that is a pretty complex problem and that is where this power of computation, power of the technique resides.
The opponent is not playing so we’ll choose the best.
This one is possible to be done in the other way, which I'm not going to talk about right now.
So the project is designed.
Now you can even compare that with neural networks that you have seen in the previous module.
For example, in a case of chess, branching factor is huge thirty-five.
When I'm doing it?
Let let me talk about how they find the shortest path.
A Simulated hill climbing is a method where sorry simulated annealing actually. Simulated annealing is is basically a superset of hill climbing that we've seen in the earlier module which allows some random movements in in the other direction.
We also have lot of other states where the problem can be in , Okay .
Now, you can find that this information provided in this statement is something which is different than the the script itself.
And now what I do?
And then we have seen the branch and bound search which looks at the the minimum value that we have found so far and keep a track of the new search path.
the new generation is going to replace the old generation in this case.
And we expect artificial neural networks to exhibit that characteristic.
But anyway this branching factor is an important point in the search process, Okay .
So anyway we are not going to discuss much about what it has done, we'll we'll see the introduction of GA .
These are is is is present in the image.
A good chess player would look at other things.
So out of minus five, two, minus one and minus two, two is the best node.
So, this is an example of rule number seven.
Is almost a replica of the previous rule.
I'm not bothered about the sign right now but because I'm not worried about five or minus five, I worried about the child which returns that.
Sparse neighbourhood gives you less number of nodes.
This is not better than the current one so we’ll not move.
We are showing the last city, right now we will not be showing it in other slides.
So that's not easy.
So, these are very simple goal stack planning
B is fox or not fox.
We have already seen the chess representation, the matrix representation and the the move representation.
So pick up the first city at random and solution city is that city, then pick up the nearest neighbour of that at that, there is no neighbour exists then return with the solution list, so that that means all the cities are explored and so on, okay .
Unfortunately, I cannot use my queen to capture the knight because my own piece is sitting in between.
What does that mean?
Okay. If I say three , I have many more.
Then we have seen how to use a predicate act.
Like from four you can go to three also or two also or one also, but with some probability.
And remember, we have chosen six plies in our example based on many things.
So, while coming back, you look at two things: the prerequisite okay .
So, that's the point here.
So the first string initial path is pasted with the later path of the second string, second strings initial path is pasted with the later path of the first string.
Because opponent is not going to play that.
Unlike Depth-first search where you try going in the left until you are stuck, here we have an artificial limit.
Important.
It works this way and we get quite accurate measurement.
If you pass the complete value up and the graph is shown in the next slide, you can see that there's not much of a difference.
okay .
Now you can see in this particular case, minus three, two, one and three, all four of the nodes are explored .
Placing it there on the in B it is good because I I can have two possible options, the last column and the diagonal line.
So, that does not mean it does not mean that this is the right way of doing it.
That's the idea of CD .
So, I I followed a a typical order that suits my this thing .
What we want is we want much larger value, the summation should be beyond , it should be far from zero in a way that later on if some weights are reduced it will still be more, so it will still be able to recognize that image of your friend.
So when they are coming back from E, again they find the obstacle.
If you teach a student how to draw A and recognize A, any sized A he should be able to recognize later, so that is called generalization.
Basic brain neuron is roughly divided into three parts, one is called Dendrites, which is basically an input device, something which provides input to the cell, the the nucleus of the neuron which which has a long cord which is called Axon and which again it is distributed in small tiny threads okay .
Because the partial part is Okay copied and then the mapping of that is used in crossover, let us try to see how it works.
Let us look at okay , the rule number one, moving from left to right.
Now how it processes?
The outcome of this whole conceptualization process then now you can write an exact problem statement of exactly what you're going to do and how and a detailed form, okay , that you're going to have this knowledge structure where this this rule is fired, you will get this and so on and so forth.
Fine might require fine tuning in in long run.
You might be surprised that what is it like and when you represent health equal to minus ten and ten it doesn't really represent the the the mental state of a person.
So, they are they are represented here.
That’s called local maxima.
The last but one level where which level it is?
There are few rules there and also the way one can represent a complex statement into CD .
I I just said a few times, a processor that’s a this is a processor learning, what exactly is a process?
So, that's a precondition you can't do that.
I’ll try exploring all possible cases until I get one.
Now the tour child A begins from E, C, B, G, A, F and D Okay .
For example a case of D, okay .
In this particular module, we have looked at some of the unguided methods.
The algorithm chooses one out of those cases.
Pick up the next node and refine solution with that node, calculate the total distance to be covered.
But here the difference is much larger and much bigger.
So, that also is possible.
So our goal is not achieved if you do it this way.
It deviates from that script and and that's why many things described in the default format of the script does not happen.
Sigmoid because it is continuous, it is possible to differentiate and differentiation is very required.
So we are going to discuss about how we can browse through the graph, the search tree that is generated for any game, how we proceed and how we find a move which is the best move for us.
The second one.
I'm exploring one more child of I, after I explored P.
It is about using domain knowledge, Okay .
Progression is about moving further in the state space towards the goal.
So this is these
Now the beauty of choosing these value can be seen in the next three next two statements.
For example, if you say that I'll I’ll bond the DFS for four levels and if you get answer, the difference between the optimal solution and the solution that you get is not more than 3.
So what you do is,
What does that mean?
And you can see that the source is Sachin, the destination is Sarfaraz.
Please remember to write M one equal to zero, otherwise you cannot solve this problem.
See the left most node which is already explored.
If there is a model behind this decision process, that model is to be explicitly specified, that this is the decision-making process if else and all that if so.
Usually the randomness allowed is more in the initial part of the search process and less in the lesser part of the search process.
We don't have something which can really represent love.
For example, two student frames are almost everything, same except the values of the attribute.
So, it's not that this is the primitive, these these are the primitives or this is the list.
Okay . We have already seen some domain knowledge.
If you try, for example, try to find a node with a value, for example, if you’re exploring the search space containing all integers you'd like to find out an integer where the square of the integer and the cube of the integer is same and you continue exploring that, you’ll never get an end to it.
DFS may not get you an optimal solution.
For example , let us again take that solutions search method of mi...missionary cannibal problem.
And you you may pick up two, three or four best and then again you expand them and so and so forth.
You can see that this search process is jittery obviously and I’ve told you the reason for it.
I’ve already told you ten is the solution, Okay , so that’s why it’s called hill climbing.
We are only going to talk about legal moves right now and not complicate the matter for writing moves for winning.
So, those XJ and WJ are multiplied okay .
There is no ISA relationship okay .
We also have rules or moves which can move the problem state from one valid state to another valid state, Okay .
You start with the solution, and then continue refining that solution.
Done.
The first we have already seen.
The other example is is one more of my student who used neural networks to find out best set of motivational strategies for employees.
This is called hill climbing.
One is how will if you have a move, which controls the center, it is better than other moves.
Well, we'll actually going to see and find out how how useful it is for solving a travelling salesman problem.
There are a lot of others, for example, run, that’s fly is also an example or drive is an example of PTRANSING , changing location, but there are other things associated, these verbs are are little more complex.
Who will choose it?
You may have to also think that.
In that case I'll be able to figure out exactly which move is better and which move is not.
Once you do that, all possible tours are provided to agents and they travel on all tours and they do change and all that eventually they’ll converge to the best path.
And I've already told you that it is shorter paths are preferred and there is a PPT which talks about that and what I’m I've already told you the other thing, that if there is some change in the path, the optimal path changes.
There's something called plausible move generator.
It's exactly similar to a leaf node and it's treated exactly in the same fashion which is which is the next state in in the game itself.
Robot is is a very important applications of AI.
That again is not very good, because something we want to move towards start state but we are deleting something which is part of the start state and we are also adding something which is not part of the start state.
So I have five different children.
Then in the next cycle what we do is in fact, Depth Bound Depth-first search, actually explores everything like the previous case and then it starts looking for the solution like this. You can see that.
We have seen unguided search methods.
But the knowledge, we don’t really know how it is being done because it is encoded in form of weights, that’s why it is called the black box of reasoning.
It provides fault tolerance.
You probably have come across some cases where there is a typical bit which is set for something.
In fact, that’s the reason why in many cases what you’re supposed to do is to for example, you’re exploring chess and after six levels you cannot explore seven, it is too much for you and you choose one node.
I'm I’m having two consecutive Xs in line so the next move I can win.
Now, this is a statement that you you probably encounter reading, okay , now here the meaning that CD gets out of this is that Purochan tries to do something which reduces Pandavas health and that actually is is is very, very important representation, because it it it involves something which is a question mark.
So, that's the problem.
Remember the idea.
And for example, we’ll take a missionary cannibal program problem.
So that is possible.
Is it a valid state?
So you can see how it works here.
So, is there is no match here.
So, multiple ants are travelling on all possible paths laying their pheromone along the path and in fact in in case of a program it doesn't start laying pheromone immediately.
So, the many researchers did many develop many artificial neurons.
And we have seen how one can write the state space.
We have already seen that.
It begins with root node as a start node.
There are many other ways in which you can represent this algorithm.
Again , we reach to the final level, so we’ll not move further, we’ll take the right child of it, it is 8,0,0 it is repeated.
There are few heuristic search methods that we’ve seen in this particular module.
So, here you can see that there was no mention of bullet or or or or the gun, but it is it is there in the representation.
What's the difference here?
If you look at the next figure TSP with refinement search titled image, you can see that you will get distance between every node to every other node and that is also depicted as a table, as a distance matrix, okay .
As I said, when if you stack up somewhere, the alternate path is going to be useful and the example that I'm going to talk about is called Speech translation problem.
If I cut and paste them what will happen, I will have two cities, the same city is appearing twice in the route which is not correct and some cities do not even appear, so that is not acceptable.
If you pick up some other strings you probably have different mapping and you will have to do it.
When to reduce?
We start with an initial state and reach to the final state.
Component, its weight component, its weight component its weights.
So let us first of all begin with deep breath the state space definition that we we already have on on the slide.
does crying means tear tears coming out of eyes?
Not always we learn that way.
Next important thing is to verbalize this knowledge.
Remember we have looked at Tic Tac Toe problem last module and we have labeled some of the states as W,L and then we have also had draw, okay .
Okay . In next case well explore all hundred and explore only first five, okay .
With that note, we'll end this module.
Now, looking at this description, let us see whether this particular state, whether these states are valid or invalid.
They are not using square function as it is.
It is indicating time.
There’s the other slanting line which moves from left to right down and the other one which is horizontal.
So default when default thing do change when the sequence is not observed when the statement indicates that the normal default sequence is is is not observed it disturbed somewhere.
It will travel A, B and C and now travelling towards now when they reach to that obstacle, they have two options.
And what you do is you pick up a better node.
In this module we'll we'll only mention that.
But as I said, it is not necessarily a drawback, as it is going to help which nodes to be explored in the next class, next iteration.
But there is no other relationship okay .
But then there is a difference.
Is it part of the start state?
The conceptual dependency is little better way of doing that, where we have lot of restriction on the type of links that we can have, type of nodes that we can have and how they can relate to each other, making it a very, very strong knowledge representation technique.
But the other case which we’ll we see next is that something happening and using which this thing is the other conceptualization.
So, there is a layer one, layer two, layer three.
And when that is that is very, very required this is the search method to go for.
In phase number one let them reach to the final this thing the city and calculate the distance, the length.
What do I mean by strong is that it it clears…it provides very, very clear meaning to our representation.
And remember, knowledge update is a critical problem and we have seen how critical that is an earlier module.
In fact, if you see the handout, I I have a complete table talking about each rule one after the other.
Now that's a difficult question. And what should it do?
In in on the screen you can see there is a simple case where I have seven different cities.
Chicken.
For example, when you say that Sachin is a cricketer, the the two entity Sachin and cricketer will have double arrow, all darkened like this, okay .
And once that is done, it becomes easier to infer, it becomes easier to translate into other languages.
Missionary M two is number of missionaries on the right-side, number of cannibals on the right side.
But when the situation becomes critical, what will you do?
And the only thing is that you represent anything that comes across, divide into pieces, and represent that thing as a very, very low-level primitives.
So, after primitives, the next thing is CD .
Why you want to go to dine?
He thought of these primitives.
Okay That's the next thing.
Okay .
So, basically T is related to that.
And a move is something which which allows you to move from one state to the other .
There is no relation of that sort.
We begin with the the leaf nodes, then start backing values up.
The second representation.
And the third one was a clever mathematical representation.
Three cases are shown on the screen okay .
We are discussing only this.
That means, it has complete connections.
We’re going to pick up a very simple problem called three-four Gallon water jug problem. Now this is also described in in a book called Elaine Rich.
Test planning, we know the experts are invited and experts are given job of writing test cases and test the system elaborately.
In our case, it's pretty simple.
It says that M one number of missionaries and C one number of cannibals are on the left hand side of the river.
So the track when you talk about a track, it talks about a particular type of that script.
One is the name of restaurant and the other is paying when you are paying it is assumed that he has followed the normal path.
In this case the action is relevant.
Now in this State-space what we do is every node represents a particular solution, a potential solution.
one of the exceptional example of Depth-first search is is used by Prolog.
And once it is completed, I go out of the stadium and all that is assumed that's called goal driven or expectancy driven reasoning that happens.
There are multiple ways of doing it.
The other one is keeping this thing as a question mark and look at the the the other statement that comes next and figure out what that placeholder is.
It says that Sachin did not go to restaurant as terrorists attacked Mumbai.
For in fact multiple verbs can be represented using the same primitive, for example, give Sachin gave his bat to Sarfaraz will have ATRANS , okay , as as a primitive.
So, the network becomes little big, pretty complex but the process is going to be the same.
So, I’ve I’ve numbered them that way.
What if it is more ?
It just it uses a simple agent.
You you you leave solutions which are not optimal, you choose solutions which are optimal.
Okay So that is the essence.
The Square function is sigma equal to zero to n xi yi . If it is greater than zero, it fires, less than zero, it doesn’t. Okay , is is very simple. If you draw a graph of it, you will be able to see that it is basically
What you need is support planning, how you do it, okay .
But once he put it on paper and in the the form as well as the report, expert will go through it and realize that this is the mistake and they may modify it there and then and that's the reason why KE should put everything that he knows into this thing the conceptualization.
Here the example is Nobita ate rice with a stick.
How to do that in in a computer program Okay is very important and that's what is is done by in in scripts and Schank and and the other researchers extended that idea of CD into scripts to represent such statements which does not only only represent a single information single conceptualizing but sequence of conceptualization which includes many, many more things actually.
So, that's why we are learning about this, Okay .
We'll explore we’ll expand the search tree as much as we can.
And usually, it most of the neural networks use three layers but the recent trend is to use many, many layers, hundreds of layers.
I give you a simpler problem to solve.
How have you come to know that this move , the set of moves is complete which is going every move that we need is is possible to be be fetched from this thing ?
But there is one more way.
Now, there is something different.
I just find out a mapping Okay , element in parent two and find out the position of that element in parent one, so D is at the position of four.
Now, there are two different set of weights, okay .
A lot of long back in even long back in Sixties, computer scientists who were working on such problems understood that these problems are different, they are not similar problems.
Look at this.
You can see that everywhere there is a white cell, we have zero, everywhere there is a black cell, we have one.
People have done it, but it's not going to be easy .Okay .
What is the branching factor?
Look at the next slide that.
Okay , we have already seen in in this particular module, we have seen two problems, trivial problems .
That ‘slash’ indicates this conceptualization is negated, means this thing did not happen.
If it is the case , they are going to eat missionary and this is something which we do not want.
’ Okay , now this is the description provided.
So, the point is inputs are flowing in the forward direction, the errors are flowing in the backward direction.
Begins with eighty-one, has nine into nine total inputs.
And on the right hand side you have tilde Fr means not Fr, farmer is not, okay .
I just skip that and I'm not skipping one path, I'm skipping many paths, because after D there may be nine branches.
A, we have started with A, now we reach to A and the cycle appears okay We'll stop this process and copy the rest of the elements as it is, so so A, okay the cycle.
So when you reach three it is dead end, you you won’t go further.
So, but you may ask, let us keep it like this, so it will immediately bump up and learn, no.
In fact, what you can do apply is additionally called branch in bound, Okay .
You can’t represent that in the state space.
Now, it is a little different.
Because, we are moving it.
State space is basically an enumeration of all possible states that the problem can be in.
Again, we calculate both of them place on top table place on top BA and addition, remember action is towards this.
How can you represent the sorrow?
But goal stack planning is basically this - inserting components in in a stack and one after the other continue solving them.
The function which gets me that is called neighbourhood function.
‘Anjali cried’.
They are called script headers, the the the props, the roles, the actions and if you find that, Okay , mentioned in the script in the statement, the script is invoked.
Thanks.
For example, we look at essays and decide that this is a good essay and this is a bad essay.
And there are lot of problems like recognizing a face, recognizing a signature.
We will see which crossover methods that we are going to use.
So twenty will happen for first five iterations then reduce by two so, so on so that that is what it stores.
This is obviously simple.
So that kind of a thing will will happen with expert in this particular phase, okay .
That’s a local surrounding, Okay .
Remember, you're not going to do this thing to the level that you conventionally do, in conventional that thing you almost right pseudocodes.
So, I just provide those images as inputs to my neuron and those inputs and I pick up some random weights, the wei wei ...weights are multiplied with the inputs and the summation is generated.
And I want to get the shortest tour.
Now you can see that if I only label like winning losing this draw.
Now look closely at this representation of eight five three gallon water jug.
A script is appropriate when script is really fitting in that statement and not always it is possible for us to judge and there are some examples provided in the handout.
So, when you want to represent act inflicting the state change, you will have to use this.
Suppose if you have four possible moves okay B,C,D any you can get either of them.
You may test it, Okay .
The other one, which one of my student did in his project, is is, he was working for a place where lot of resumes flowing in daily.
For example, if you get a statement called ‘Jay went to watch a match and he was very happy’ you can conclude that he was happy because the exit condition says that if the team has won he is happy.
See earlier we had a problem.
Okay , Why?
W and N you choose W and so on so forth.
And and this again has default information.
okay So, let us move on.
So, these are called dependencies and dependencies are part of CD .
And once you decide those differences, those differences are added on the stack and you just pick up the first different, find out which action is suitable to remove this or eliminate this difference and provide that.
So, this this Axon is basically an output device.
The set of genetic information is encoded in human genome.
That is shown in the next rule.
They they contain forty six chromosomes and that is twenty three pairs of chromosomes found in the nucleus of each cell, okay , the forty six chromosomes are found.
An interesting thing is if you look at the shape of both functions, if positively classified, correctly classified value, for example, for your friend, the output should be greater than zero and you get zero point one .
Twelve million rules! Think of it.
Assume that robot is moving around in in a room.
So that’s exactly what is happening here.
So, one way to do that is to use a state space representation and that's exactly what we are going to do, next.
Okay And you have output units.
One of the great things about CD is that it becomes language independent once you convert the statement into CD .
H one H one W one J, H one W two J and so on.
Number of missionaries should be more or equal to number of cannibals on either side of the river.
We’ll again start with 8,0,0.
The prototype is analyzed on technical grounds.
okay The only point left out so far in this particular discussion, what will be the first call?
And, whenever it is it is possible when the goals are interdependent, suppose you want to solve a problem which un-solves some other problem. If that happens you just test and if it is the case the which is unsolved is again inserted in the goal stack and again solved.
There is nothing which describes the fox to be farmer to be on one side or the other.
When the temperature value is less, less probability of moving to a bad move.
We have already seen number of missionaries must be greater than or equal to number of cannibals.
That again you might probably think. You already have intrusion detection system.
The difference here is is about the the application of heuristic function nothing other than that.
Not farmer.
So, what Purochan is trying to do?
So, once it finds that thing similarities it doesn't need to worry because it's there in the start state, it is also there in the end state you don't need to change them.
Why we want to avoid the cycle? Let me repeat, we do not want to continue further.
If the array is empty then report failure.
Extensive plan to help user out from any problems encountered, playing working with expert system also is to be charted out.
You require multiple interfaces.
It it first, it begins with similarities and differences between start and goal states.
We don’t really know how these weights encode the knowledge, but somehow at the end these weights are able to recognize signature, finding out the who the person is in the image and so on so forth.
One way to do it is this.
But that's a pretty hard part of the state space representation and solving problems using state space.
Instead of picking up one rule and find out if this node is better, what it does is explores everyone and pick up pick up the best one.
In this particular module, we looked at conceptualization, prototype construction, then we've looked at formalization, then we have looked at the implementation and then we have looked at the testing part of the expert system design.
Okay .
Now carefully look at how the solution is achieved.
We have seen what AI is and we have seen how to represent problems using state space and we have seen how to search .
You may convert this representation a little better representation by looking at the context later.
Now the first thing we have to do, is to write the state space of it.
So it is huge amount of time that is required.
Testing is again as I said a very, very critical part.
The neural network should not only recognize my system my signature but should which I already presented or should not only recognize the image which is presented in the database but should also be able to recognize some other image of the same person and that is called generalization.
The resources, for example, X-ray machine and deep inspection.
So, if you use a breadth first search you are likely to get the solution much faster.
It has to have more number of components and sort of capability to decide what what the opponent is thinking.
So, that's precisely describing our requirement.
Now is it a good thing to have?
Here, we can change this, we can actually mimic this by changing the program itself, the way we could.
But it is basically mutation is never considered good in humans but in here in this case, mutation sometimes is used for there is a reason and is very similar to something that we have seen in this thing ,
There is no In fact, there is no input unit, there is no hidden unit, there there is nothing which you you it is called single layer perceptron.
And throw and kick as I've talked about also involves involve moving a body part, the other one is called MTRANS , mental transformation, something where the the mind is involved.
okay , So, and you can see that bullet and all that is already there.
Anyway so humans can do it but when computers are to do it, they have to convert the problem is to be converted into state space like we've done and and and we'll have to find out the rule and apply that rule and again if there are multiple rules, you’ll have to arbitrate somehow and get the right rule to apply.
And that's why we have to provide number of images, okay .
Just compare them.
Until you reach to the cycle you copy from parent one, once you reach you copy from parent two.
Please understand opponent has two options.
For example, W one zero one means a weight between zeroth input unit to first hidden unit.
But remember if this exploration one of the parameter of exploration is the criticality of the game.
We’ll be looking at one or two very very powerful algorithms of using neural networks, okay .
Though it it sounds a wasteful at the first sight where you’re exploring the tree again, it saves on memory as well as if we’re using heuristics with it, it is possible to choose better moves in the next cycle.
And the solution basically is is a method of starting from initial state, move around in state space using legal moves and reach to a final state.
Okay .
This is the only slide which contains those names, they are all not that important for us as right now, but if you're trying to dealt deeper into GA later, probably you need to learn more about them. okay .
You may use the better represent.
That way.
I I have to be hungry, and I have to have money.
Hopefully the summation will be less than zero now.
So, then that's not the right way.
Remember why we are exploring multiple players?
This is the current state, the start state.
not all experts agree on either components, neither the weights.
Okay , the first rule says X Y Z.
In in these trivial cases, we only need a two value vector and a three value vector, three integers only.
In in the previous modules, we have seen how can one define a State Space, how can one define and so and so forth.
I was reading about an expert system which had twelve million rules .
Now, what is delta tau T plus one?
So we are not going to explore that further, Okay .
It starts with one, Okay and then again start, have two levels of tree and then again start have have the three levels of tree and so and so forth.
With this, I would like to end this particular module.
ok The current state, every time I have to take a move, the current state is given to the algorithm.
It is possible to represent a problem in two different ways.
For example, there is a bowler who is very tall, Irfan who is is pretty tall.
So the complete scenario is is is assumed once I state that.
They are called I’m I'm calling them other search methods some in fact we are going to have one more module after that which we are we are going to discuss some typical search methods.
It’s that simple.
For example, if I want want to find out minimum between one three and five, then I is minus one minus three and minus five.
So, you'll have to get some consensus on it if you have a team of experts.
SEF returns the winning chances for player one, not player two.
and if it is so they they use their smelling and hearing ability to figure out if they are nearby and at the first sight of the enemy around they start running.
And complete action many a times cannot be solved by one action so it generates new goals and places there.
Why it is called steepest ascent?
So if you have fox and grain on one side, absolutely no problem.
So, we had M one before.
Or the other example is that I that I've also listed in the handout is that we went to Osho’s eatery when we went to Mandvi, and we enjoyed our dinner there.
Now that’s something which is an advantage of Depth Bound Depth-first search.
So you you can always, once you explore that entire tree you can apply heuristic and find out which moves are better compared to others.
So, if a an ant has found a food source, if other ant is looking for a path there is high probability that the other ant chooses the same path.
Unguided Search is used at two cases, there is not enough domain knowledge, we don’t know, Okay .
You will have to find some other way.
You can see 3,5,0 is the next one, 0,5,3 is the next one, 3,5,0, now that’s the dead end.
You know Google Maps it’s using the Google Maps Google Car is using Google Maps but how will you represent that?
In case number one there I can play and you can see the bold face X is our movement if I place in case of A it is little better because B is not very good because the third space is already occupied and playing elsewhere is not also very good.
But you can see I've already told you that this method is actually an extension to our Breadth First Search or hill climbing.
What is bike?
And when you talk about scripts, when they are invoked, those default things are overridden by by the information that is provided in the script.
Not only that king will have a value which is more than the total of all the values of all other nodes, all other pieces.
It was for possible in the single layer version.
Why it is required?
Remember we would like to remove components which are there in the start state, not in the end state.
Now this is very similar to what we have seen before.
Welcome back friends.
CD Now, this is an excellent example how CD can aid information. We already have how CD generates this structure.
It's called conceptual tense.
For example, in the case number one, we have three two, the case number two we have four four zero, is a final state.
Is it a relevant thing?
But understand that this is a very, very critical requirement for a function to be used in in in Back propagation like algorithm.
Okay , so it it it looks simple on the face of it, but it is hard.
For example, if you're playing chess, you wont look at all possible moves, you only look at some which are good, which are which are better compared to others.
You also have to have some kind of performance assessment system.
And here, Farmer Fox Chicken Grain problem.
In fact, when there is the rule is pretty specific, the prerequisites are pretty specific, simple.
We have looked at two important points: progression and regression.
You've already seen in semantic net that we we can represent the natural language statements using some links and some nodes.
So, this is not a relevant move.
We have seen six different options possible for a Tic Tac Toe case and you will have to evaluate those cases to figure out exactly what is static evolution function’s value.
Okay .
You can see that it is not C is not resting on the table.
It is again pretty simple.
Now here, please understand, there are two different problems.
Look at that, X Y where X belongs to four zero, sorry zero four and Y belongs to zero three . So any value between zero to three, any value between zero to four, is something that you can write.
Voice recognition systems and face detection systems and there many, many similar systems used in practice which, in sense using back propagation algorithm.
Thank you
Now it is impossible for the speech translation program to go back and try other because it has to be continuously translating everything that the person is speaking.
We’ll not explore complete game trees in most cases.
That also assume one more thing that I was hungry, Okay .
So, some information about Deep Blue is provided.
Yeah .
Because if I for example I say that any two children that is going to be huge , not only that any number of changes, I have a huge value.
I'll have only ten different children.
Obviously the knowledge base processing comes next.
So, these things are important.
Now ride is an act, okay .
So what people do it they do it empirically and find find out.
This is precisely what we want and the boat moves on the right side.
So second cycle.
We can say that this row , we call it w zero , so it is basically and we can take it on the left side of the equation, what we have is x one, w one, x two w two at the end minus w zero greater than zero , then it is firing, less than zero, it is not firing, or output one or zero.
One more thing is that it’s capable of using looking at fuzzy things and manage.
So, that is something which is there, but you can see that additionally with a friend.
So, that part is done here.
Even while they are they are grazing they they they keep on hearing the sound and looking it around to make sure that there are no carnivorous animals around
‘Crying’ means tears coming out of eyes.
So, when it is represented in in CD , all other statements are added all these objects which are implicitly mentioned are added.
okay So, if you write a mathematical equation and when you are representing a real world, this is something which is tricky.
But then the transfer of of ownership is is from Sachin to Sarfaraz and that is important here.
The beta release is given to the the customers, the usual customers and their feedback is taken and then you release the final product.
For example, in chess, there are many heuristics possible.
Now G is to be mapped to D.
So, we we look back at our own that thing and and we’re we very happy to learn that our logic is still there, we dig that thing out and put that thing into the code and that worked.
So, when there are many other cases.
It's very hard for me to decide whether this value is very, the estimate is very correct or not.
It is possible to encode it actually
So, you can see there are four steps shown on the slide which which does just that okay , and just go back.
How to get them is a hard problem.
X Y Z greater than zero or equal to zero, where we don't have negative values, X less than or equal to eight.
It says that the farmer is on the right hand side and at L Fx which is not says that fox and chicken cannot be there together on the left side and chicken and grain cannot be together on the left hand side.
So, that is one way of doing it.
That's a restriction.
Basically, ant colony optimization is about learning what others are doing and and learning to solve problems like them.
Current state zero current player means, current state is the state, on on which the MiniMax is applied.
So, you just apply static evaluation function to B, C and D.
The breadth first search we replace by branch and bound in all cases.
Sachin gifted a bat to Sarfaraz, also will have that.
Are they same?
If missionary is one cannibal can be one or zero.
Obviously, when any spaces have to live and and when the condition is that the resources are limited they will have to fight for the survival.
So, we'll be talking about that.
Conceptual roles are are also very important.
So, the the backing up value happens in the inverse order.
It's kind of a draw.
An interesting exercise that you can pick up and the try out is - Can you write a single rule converting these two rules into one?
Now look at the example shown on the screen, it it has a goal state and has a previous state.
Even today it is being so.
So okay , so that's how it it learns?
So, I I won't spend time talking about this.
Now I will trim anything which is less than twenty-two because I already have a solution which can provide me twenty-two.
For example, if you use a heuristic function called H which for a better move gives a higher value of heuristic function.
Given a solution state, I can actually generate multiple solution states from it.
Now implementation planning is basically how you're going to implement this, deciding about the the classes and all that.
Now the rest is to be picked up from other parent, that means child one will have other cities from parent one and child two will have city cities from parent two, Okay
But that is precisely what we’re supposed to do and that’s the theme of this chapter.
In fact for travelling salesman problem the fitness function is pretty simple, the total distance covered negatively is the fitness function. okay .
Whatever is added and you have interact section with the goal state and if this is phi that means you have added many things with nothing is part of the goal state it’s a fruitless exercise, it should not be phi.
The next one is propel.
So six is a dead end in this case.
I can actually try sparse neighbourhood by just assuming a a case where two adjacent cities are being exchanged.
Whenever we encounter that word, we'll take that form out and we'll just use placeholders from the statement.
So, that that is one of the important parts of the formalization.
And using this method actually many other problems are also solved.
This is precisely what this particular statement says.
The first difference is that the neuron is very slow, it operates in the range of milliseconds or processors operate in the range of nanoseconds.
Yes, we can do it because we only have seven cities here, we'll we'll be able to do it very easily.
Okay , we’re only taking a small segment of this thing .
Okay Multi layer neural network which anyway, I I discussed about that in the previous module and we are going to study that thing really more detail in this particular module.
There is something wrong.
And I've told you in the previous module, the best approach to design an expert system is to build a very simple prototype, and recursively modify it to represent or convert to the final system, that's the best approach.
And DNAs are replicated in the offspring,
Corresponding element of H is C and C appears at position number three, so they that is added Okay you can see; a position that appears in child one now. Okay .
Yes.
okay number of missionaries, number of cannibals, great! they are they are still three.
And maximum is it is three and two are lesser value.
You can see that in the third one also you have a cycle.
it should be null, it should be phi.
Now, let us begin the exploration of the algorithm itself, the MiniMax algorithm.
In fact, every level you will be exploring one node for more than every the total number of nodes that you’ve explored even in the case where you have a binary tree.
cough The rule number sixteen talks about an attribute of an actor and the actor himself, that relation.
Now, you can see that there is a deviation which clearly indicates that watching a match does not happen.
The beauty of representing things into using script is that it can help you learning about sequential and causal relationship because the agents act in sequential fashion, Okay , like buying tickets and then going inside the stadium and so on so forth.
So how it is done and you can probably will understand by this figure.
Great!
In this particular module we’ll be talking about syntactical rules about the conceptual dependency representations.
okay , and you will have to have plans, various plans for but design, as I said is not as detailed as the conventional one, is usually kind of ‘let it evolve’ kind of situation here.
Thank you!
Okay so that the next condition represents that.
I'm guaranteed to get minus three or more.
There is something called dead end also.
So, we’ll come across this once again.
I consider it to be part of AI at least the initial part GA was quite associated with AI .
okay , that's the initial state.
Basically, the goal state will give you action.
So, that is the best place to move.
As I said, this over function might check many things, so we're we have not written this function, we've only called this function with two values - current state and current player.
Instead of using the same heuristic function, you use some other route.
So, whenever an electrochemical signal arrives at neuron, the the dendrites will capture that, send that thing to the nucleus, the nucleus process process is that and then send it across over Axon.
Now three. Okay .
We'll see the examples of all of them soon.
And what is the amount of memory that you need?
These are used today.
The inputs come from this side and flows through this layers and then goes out from the last layer.
Now, if there is a local minima, local maxima whatever, when it is moving around and it falls into local minima or climbs up local maxima, it cannot go forward.
Difference between this winding and unwinding phase is, winding phase if you call f-one and then again the next call and a third call, so winding part happens first here, then here, then here, then here normal conventional case.
Because you're hungry, so that precondition is added. It also adds that we went inside Jungle Book we were seated, we ordered all that everything is added. Okay , so when we encounter such statements, a series of statements are represented and inserted and that's called invoking a restaurant script.
So, point is I should not be diverted in in wrong direction.
In fact,I I was.
it’s more likely they travel back on the same path and it attracts more number of ants, okay .
And also chicken and grain cannot be on that side, okay .
A chess board, you can have this two states.
N inputs are presented.
So, in this particular module we will be discussing about what neural networks are in subsequent to more modules.
Eventually, you’ll run out of actions all all actions are applied at the state that we achieve is a goal state, we are done.
Ants, they’re spraying pheromone values.
Now, Sita was happy because of that, okay .
When path one is little shorter the ant from E will reach faster over that line and when more ants will be travelling on that line, number of trips that probably because of we assume that equal number of ants coming from both directions, you can see that the path one you will have more number of ants travelling and more frequently.
But beyond D you just use the heuristic to estimate the remaining path.
When knowledge is redundant, we have a problem.
So, same way D and N is the next combo and N is what it chooses.
And you again can see that there is a placeholder called ‘Do’.
So we won't have that chance.
A simple a single state space can be represented in multiple ways, a the same same way the rules also can be written multiple ways.
How can a computer program do it?
It says that A plus B plus C plus D not equal to six, twelve and four.
At minimizing layer we have two options possible winning and losing as the opponent is going to choose and we get the loss.
So, it is 0 to N okay and you what you add? You add XI WI okay .
We've seen the rules are very pretty simple, addition and subtraction.
Number of input units is decided based on the input okay , the size of file that you take for input.
For example, if you use a sparse neighbourhood you just replace to adjacent or or or exchange to adjacent city information.
And using artificial neuron they tried to solve those complicated seemingly complicated problems.
There are reasons.
And if I have large number of nodes, it's called Dense neighbourhood.
Now, you can see that these two representations happen in parallel.
okay we are looking at the prerequisites see that, Look at this.
Place on top BA dot deletion intersection SS should not be phi, it should remove something which is there in the start state which again you will see that there is something called free A which was there in the start state, now it is removed.
When we say ‘flew to LA’, we are providing additional information.
With that we end with this module.
It's based on the player as well as the state.
Simplicity is is the other issue.
What about this?
More importantly, we must understand that this is an idea how how to represent a language statement of a language using simple primitives.
We will only be able to use legal moves.
How users can communicate problems to the company, who will be responsible for handling those customers problem, what type of support staff is needed, how system configuration and implementations are handled, how domain experts are used to handle these problems and so on so forth.
cough And interestingly most of the cases entry conditions are not satisfied specified in the statement but when they are not specified in the statement, they are assumed like in the case of the earlier statements that we have encountered.
if SS is the final solution set that satisfies the the criteria that you like to achieve, is great.
Okay , if you >can represent something using a state space it is possible because we have a structured mechanism of moving around in states where starting from the initial state , use legal moves to reach to that final state.
If you look from the angle of a programmer, this requires a lot of memory and you don’t really know how many nodes are going to be explored.
We’ve seen that we we we entangled into local maxima and if we find that our children don’t have the value better than us, what should we do?
We will be discussing about Neural Networks this time.
So, this is how you can define a state space, you can have initial and final state, you can define moves and how you apply most to solve a problem.
So, these are the things which is are very important in in CD .
It’s very hard okay to write rules, debug them, and once you do that, your computing system has to choose one rule from them, pretty hard.
With that will complete this discussion on MiniMax algorithm.
Remember the heuristic value, the static evaluation function value and maximizing layer will pick up a node with maximum value and the minimum layer will pick up that by minimum value.
Eventually , what I get is three two.
Now what I do, I just copy rest as it is and what I get is this, this four, okay .
You have two white pawns here, but the lowermost pawn, you can see that the importance of it.
And the cyclic crossover, we what we do is we we pick up an element from parent one and pick up a corresponding element in parent two and pick up that element, and use that position to to store that in in the, to to copy that thing in the child and so and so forth.
And when he does that, he he himself learns about his own knowledge, okay .
There are some important differences.
After some time no ants will be travelling along path two.
When this particular process is to be terminated?
So, that person is also required.
So that data structure, it's pretty complex.
How you decide a state?
So, everything that I talked about is is is shown here.
It is basically a weighted average.
Okay , You probably have heard about professional chess playing programs and something if you if you if you read computer related information, probably you have heard about Garry Kasparov being beaten by a computer built by IBM engineers.
So you first, you begin with A now you D.
Because is already there in the original one it is copied from that.
Results are when you say that Jay Jay went to watch a match and he was ecstatic probably you can get that his favorite team has won because that the result shows result has two outputs happy and not happy, happy when your favorite team has won and not happy when your favorite team has lost.
Obviously, we are going to solve the problems, so, we'll have to decide the solution as well in the detail.
In fact it is not good, obviously because you're not exploring all nodes.
Similarly, Sarfaraz took a bat from Sachin will also have the same thing because it’s basically, essentially the same thing.
Okay , go back to next city okay .
Now that is important ‘with a friend’ okay .
So, a relevant progression moving from start space to the end state can easily be understood by having it does something which removes something which is there in start state but not in goal state and adds something which is there in the end state but not in the start state.
okay The other things are same like you can see PTRANS ‘Sachin to restaurant’.
the rule is return in a very simple programming like way.
Done.
We explore the top when we get all nodes, we apply heuristic values to them, add them in the array and again pick up that node from the top.
And you can see that the ‘reason’.
Thus it is tested this way and and that's critical part in the processing.
So, exploring next ply will require almost thirty-five percent thirty five times more than the current ply.
Well the last one, last city is always the first city.
Genetic Algorithms is is is a method of solving problems based on how life forms persist.
What we do is from current state from current state we remove additions and then add preconditions.
So, the idea is that we are the brain is capable to manage buzzy and incomplete information.
For example, in this case, Jay got bored not because security person has shown him or or tell him to stand in a queue but he got bored because he has to wait for a long period and the queues were pretty long.
But in case of A, you will almost invariably find them.
okay So, for that I I have that value and also the path from where I am connecting, what's the exact path and what's the heuristic value of that particular path.
So point is I can actually decide number of children that I'm going to have, if I'm exploring solution space search.
In fact the vertical line that you see from zero to one is is not actually indicating any input, it is just shown to make sure that you it looks like square.
Now, that is whatever is deleted is it part of the goal state?
In fact sparse and dense neighbourhood can also be applied in in conventional constructive search.
You'll have to find out the previous state from this.
Almost all AI problems what my point is almost all AI problems are harder than what you see what what what you find them at the first glance.
Next four we are not moving them.
How do we know that these rules are going to be useful for solving a problem?
Rule execution also is to be tested.
Suppose if I'm I have a bunch of states say twenty different states I and I try to see if this sequence is good enough for me to get a solution.
Obviously, because it's a longer path.
clears nose The next one is called PTRANS or physical transformation like abstract one, which was there before, okay .
Maximum maximum value of the ch...children is passed up.
X two into W one two one X three W three one.
There are so many other problems which we can talk about
The third rule is talking about a case, when Y plus Z is is less than five.
More number of ants coming from either C or E will prefer that path one and that will make it more attractive.
Okay , so the branching factor, the next thing which we’re trying to explore.
So, that is also talked about later in the slide that delta T plus one tau T plus one is basically I equal to one to N delta tau T plus one I, which is a contribution from Ith ant.
Obviously because this is the only one rule I can apply.
T is something that we use to control this probability.
What that would like to end this particular module, what we have seen in this particular module?
One is 4,4,0 and the other one is 4,1,3.
Okay , it's just the test nothing else.
But then there are some issues with using this as SEF .
You can see that Sachin is clever.
Then you take up any one of them.
So, what we have to do is wherever the xi is non-zero, one, we have to change the value of w. We have to reduce that value because we want to reduce the amount of summation.
So, the point is researchers started working in the direction of designing or mimicking human brain by providing algorithms which can work that way, and there are many models in fact.
Okay .
Now see corresponding element is B, so B is copied, you can see that B is copied again, so in child one at this point of time is A, B, C, D, next three are unknown, H and unknown.
The case number three I’m I’m is also good.
So, you may need to do that.
It is possible to generalize, in fact this method is good enough for us to generalize.
And detailed documentation is also very, very critical here.
Not better value, you generate the other children and so on, so forth.
We have not used all those rules which we have defined.
Now now you can see that that part is also quite simple compared to the previous rule this is more readable actually.
Because we’re looking at all possible nodes and we’ll pick up the node which which gives us steepest ascent, will give us highest value the heuristic value of the children, Okay .
the new generation takes place,
Okay , so, that slope can be adjusted.
I’ll be talking about that in due course.
Let us recap what we have seen in this particular module.
There is There are some its called Maxwell's equation and why it is designed?
For example when number of missionaries are less than number of cannibals you cannot accept that state.
You just lay pheromone again once you reach to the last segment, lay pheromone value again and then again start the process.
So, script interpretation resolution of ambiguity, Okay , can answer this question just because it was based on the scripts.
So, it will will never have that data loss kind of an issue.
And here okay , every this is ATRANS represents an action, transformation of ownership and it has an actor, the actor is the person who initiates that process. For example, when I say that Sachin gave his bat to Sarfaraz, Sachin is an actor but if you say that Sarfaraz received a bat from Sachin, Sarfaraz is an actor.
So, the figures, the three figures in the handout as well as the PPT clearly indicates this part.
We represent the concept and not the words and that's the power of CD .
As I said, a single conceptualization talk about a very simple, involves a single primitive.
And if the output is wrong, it floats those errors back and that's why because of this, the algorithm is known as back propagation.
Minus ten is a defeat for me, ten is a win for me and the value between minus ten to ten indicates the merit of that particular state, how good or bad that state is.
If, this is also not the case, we have multiple children.
Now, this is one very important difference.
Language has its own boundaries and the problem with that also is inherited into CD .
It can be divided into curve and round and broken and all that .
But you may do this and you will be able to get the right answer.
What is the difference?
You can see that there are now, this is only an extension to what we have seen in the earlier module.
Somebody is dead then it is called health equal to minus ten in CD .
There is a weight between X one okay , remember, the X zero and H zero look like inputs but you can see that there is no arrow going inside.
Which class is a friend of other class if you're coding in C++, there’s a concept of friend, kind of.
So, that indicator you can see a a double arrow pointing, and you can see that it is pointing to conceptualization and not the act.
8,0,0, something which is already generated.
Why chess is solved?
It is basically summation of all ants and their pheromones.
The hidden layer number of units people have worked on and decided that the best value for hidden unit number of hidden units, can be calculated by using geometric mean of input number of input units and number of hidden the output units.
I've collected all of them, from collect collected them from the papers, so you better you may read those papers yourselves.
If you do that for thirty less than anything less than thirty two, five units are good.
It is not about representing a problem in state space,no.
Let us look at what let us summarize what we have we have looked at in this module before we embark on the next module.
So, here it is different.
Remember, we have to find out maximum value in case of a maximizing layer, minimizing at at the minimizing layer.
And here, the example is watching a match which we have seen in the last module.
So, these things can be inferred though it is not directly mentioned in the script it those things can be inferred and that's the power of script.
Okay , so kind of Okay , so and I'm also using a physical force, so PROPEL is also involved.
But if you if you know how and there are some books available on how to write heuristic function for a given domain like chess.
Thank you.
Because Sita is happy because of that.
Now this is something which you should try to avoid.
okay He might also say that the system is to be redesigned because now he has learned everything and he can suggest that this is the mistake that I made and I’d like to improve on it.
For example, or or or critical cases like king is under attack, threat of fork which is basically mimicking how human player works okay , which obviously will take more time, explore more number of nodes and also look at more number of moves and also deeper.
So, it’s basically sigma xi wi where i ranges from one to n.
That is the meaning B plus F is two that means one of them is zero.
So what you can do is you can apply variable , the neighbourhood descent function.
Okay the algorithm is pretty simple.
So this temperature is actually an artificial value that we take.
Okay , my pocket for example which I I just did.
The entry conditions I have talked about the locations,People involved,object involved and the results and all that they are all all all mention in the explicitly at now which was not mention in the orignal statement okay .
We have introduced Neural Networks in this module, we have seen how brains work, the artificial neuron and then we have looked at how this artificial neuron actually can process data, we have seen how threshold value can also be used together with the other inputs and we have seen two activation functions, square and sigmoid.
Because if you see that slope okay .
It stores that information in some convenient form, which is not known to anyone of us, okay .
Now we’re not looking at the children.
We have seen three different ways of doing it.
Some cases one search method is better than some other cases, the other method is better.
Pick up the start node, it’s it’s the current node if it’s the goal, great, you don’t need to do anything.
So again in this case, though a lot of other things are mentioned script should not be invoked.
Rating an essay or rating a post.
What’s whenever when the outcome or the result is getting bored, it can write those things correctly, then it is also possible for somebody to predict why he got bored.
So it's not always be that simple.
And it in fact, for that what you're supposed to do is to derive meaning out of that statement, okay .
Here, we will be talking about progression, regression and few other things.
Okay , let us recap what we have looked at in this particular module.
If you know how to do that, does a a as I've already discussed that thing in the previous module that there is something called heuristic which can help us.
Okay .
So, readability is the other issue.
It takes two things as input.
This is called feed forward.
Whatever you do or say that I will design classes for it, I design this different types of links and so on, so forth.
In fact when we we explore the tree we we explore the tree for a case, the next case, the partial solution tree.
So longer the path less the pheromone value.
I have not written that.
So who will choose it?
The process is basically descending and not ascending like hill climbing.
There are some rules that determines how the representation takes place.
L M one M one.
If you've seen how ants find their food source, okay , how they move around and find that food source, if you have studied that process, you probably understand what I'm talking about.
Most of the commercial programs use many static evaluation evaluation function components like Deep Thought had eight thousand odd components.
There's one example shown on the screen A is resting on B, B is resting on C, C is resting on D.
We have written a function, we are of function call only.
The one more important point, one more important component of SEF is called degree of freedom.
For example, you have a color of skin which which is not inherited from either parents.
When when the array becomes empty because there is no node to explore, Okay .
Okay So and we have take taken a character recognition example.
Now thats little surprising, what variable neighbourhood could be?
The object of how Mahesh hurt Jayesh what's the object?
Why?
Static evolution function is also assumed to be existing we don't write, define any static evolution function here and we'll we'll see that there is something on alpha-beta pruning.
In normal cases you require twenty five, thirty thousand epochs.
T is temperature but not real is basically our remember it is in case of the annealing process, the physical annealing process, temperature reduction is determined based on the empirical values and their results their their experiments.
So > now look at the middle part.
So, that thats great things about life forms and the same thing we are going to have adopt in GA that is adopted in GA to solve problems.
For example, when you say that ‘Sachin gave his bat to Sarfaraz’ and when you say that ‘Sachin gifted his bat to Sarfaraz’, there is a difference between ‘give’ and ‘gift’.
So that there there are three ones listed on the slide, Okay .
So, when I represent that statement, I say that Irfan this arrow and now this is not exactly like the previous arrow.
Anyway, now you can see that there is a deviation from a normal sequence which clearly indicates that there is something wrong.
You can move in all directions.
Now what you have to do is to start from one node and send agents to all paths, okay .
Long almost twenty years, after long period somebody could find multi-layer perceptron, multi-layer neural network and could actually demonstrate that it can solve almost every problem that comes across.
So G is replaced by D. Okay .
L is the side of the river, the left side of the river.
The earlier search methods that we’ve seen are called constructive search methods.
The other one which is also quite interesting is that we we always pick up the best node irrespective of the parent value.
We just see if the the sequence is a solution,if not we’ll pick up some other sequence.
If I go on doing it, I’ll not be able to solve my problem in my lifetime.
We are going in depth, we are not exploring it, we just take a left root, left root, left root, left root. Go.
What is the consequence of it?
If my current node’s heuristic value is three, I get a node with with heuristic value five I I just move.
Solution space is okay Solution but it won’t search like other search methods that we have seen so far.
And again, what is the I value?
If it is not , you can pour everything that you can and whatever is left is is kept here.
So if you look at that array you can easily understand the children that you’re generating is already explored.
Once that is done, okay once we get that those values static evaluation function now try to understand how we learn about win, lose or draw.
This is something which we do everyday .
So, if we have reached to the player, in in the earlier case we have looked we have found that six is a an as a value for the ply.
And what are the concerns about the impa When when the system fails to detect intrusion or when the system fails to detect a disease, when the system incorrectly classifies a disease which is not and so on so forth.
Because when MYCIN did something similar, it got seventy two percent accuracy.
That that slide talks about the power of that white pawn.
So, there are many things.
If you try a Depth-first search you probably will not get.
So, here that is what we are doing.
When use GA and and on problems like this it is not easy for you to combine them by using a single point crossover like cutting the tour into half here, and cutting the other two into half and just combine them, because the cities maybe repeated and sometimes cities may be omitted, so that is not is not allowed, that is why we need little different type of crossover methods, there are three crossover methods we have seen, one is called partially mapped where a small part of one parent is copied into children and based on that mapping the rest of the elements are filled up.
All events can be added, all people not explicitly mentioned are possible to be added, all props involved are added and then the sequence of events, the default sequence of events are all added, Okay .
We have seen that.
Thank you
So, that is something that that mechanisms to store current state is very important.
One is rho, rho value of that piece.
As it started raining when he was paying, he called a cab service for returning home.
We'll see what exactly each part is doing in this particular algorithm.
So, we call them equation ten point one and ten point two which are which indicates the output generated for both of them.
Now, this is a very simple function, it outputs zero or one based on the total summation of wi xi.
Okay , for example missionary cannibal we've already I've already talked about that and this slide actually is talking about that again.
We have also seen threat of fork and degree of freedom as additional two components of for SEF .
And that happens in our manual case as well and the program is probably doing that as well.
With that we’ll conclude.
And you can also see that this is a complete network, every input unit is connected to every middle unit and every middle unit or hidden layer unit is connected to every output unit.
And, when we only have an estimate it is likely that we try in one direction, we may fail, we have to try in the other direction and so on, so forth.
Basically, what we want in neural network solution is to mimic brain, human brain.
So, you have to because A is resting on top of B.
The job of a hidden layer is is to identify features okay .
My king is under attack kind of.
The response which is generated from there because because he was threatened by Rajan.
You can have the top row or the last column okay .
In fact, a complex script will have alternate scenes if a scene af...after one scene if this happened, or this can happen we’ll soon soon see some examples of that.
The people who worked on it call it objective function. Okay .
Now there is a cause effect relationship.
When you do that in in case of refinem…this thing the branch and bound that thing is known as the refinement search.
Okay how see how it is done.
That means that I'm sending two cannibals on the other side.
The first statement that you can encounter is MiniMax, the arguments are current state, current depth and current player.
So, we we have seen some other examples earlier where we have clearly stated that this is the solution and we say that the program is going to do it that way.
You can even control that thing that that's why that method is better.
When you try solving on BA, what you need is free B which is not there okay .
So, that is called Variable neighbourhood.
Second is position.
Now whenever the other ant ants start moving, what that does it do, it looks at all possible paths and there is a high probability that it chooses a path with a higher value of pheromone.
So you pick up four, again, pick up all all children are four, five, six and four.
It is not going to allow us to win.
As I said it’s daunting for most of the cases, even our trivial case, it’s not easy.
So, this is the artificial neuron also is designed exactly in that fashion.
Not only that, for every problem which we take, there are some implicit assumptions.
The unwinding part in most of the recursive algorithm, the unwinding part is more critical because, every function contains that the winding whatever is there every function contains, whenever you have a function call made, this is a function which calls some other function.
So, when I say that I want to I went to dine yesterday, the the whole bunch of information is provided.
But when we talk about mutation is about making sure that there is some real random inheritance takes place.
There are some other representations possible as well.
And in but then inheritance involves lot of randomness.
If we’re exploring like hill climbing we’ve we’ve come to a dead end actually because three only two children minus one and minus two both of them are having less value so we’ll not be going forward.
okay .
One is called layer.
What we do is, we just get all those images, store those images in in in in the database, provide each image to the algorithm, we call it neural network algorithm or Back propagation neural network or some other algorithm.
So, that's the next thing that we are going to talk about is a method to optimize.
I MTRANS match and then the the information is coming from eyes and going to my CP , Okay .
So, I the input unit and J hidden unit, W one IJ, W two IJ is Ith hidden unit to Jth output unit.
Now what beam search is?
The prerequisites of the rule describes the conditions when the rule is applicable.
Okay .
As is already given at minus nine.
Seven minus one factorial.
All of them will start using path one and you can see that when they find path one, again it is the optimized path.
I choose top five from it,
We don't need to do anything else you can see that this is a very simple representation compared to all both of the representations before.
In this module, we have seen that how this thing is divided into layers, how the activations flow, how the values are calculated, how the weights are named.
Say what will you do?
So, we no state will have number of missionaries other than three, number of cannibals other than three, okay .
they start with a random set, evolve and combine solutions.
We're going to the previous state and look at the description that we’ve provided.
Now this part is already done okay .
Okay same way Milkha Singh ran yesterday.
Let us see.
And we are not actually showing how the variables are manipulated.
In some cases, the search space is not finite.
Now when the ants will continue travelling.
For example, you begin with a sparse neighbourhood when you stuck up, when you have a problem, when you have local maxima try dense neighbourhood and try an alternate route, okay ?
The other important thing about CD is that it captures the meaning of a statement, rather than just showing links about the words that those are used in the statement, rather than providing that superficial understanding of what the statement is about.
Because, is the opponent is going to play and there is an alternate equal I available which opponent can play which is which leads to almost defeat for us minus nine.
And it's not an algorithm.
Okay , but then there is a difference.
Many a times, the neurons appear in multiple layers.
Remember , we discussed about plausible move generator in the previous module.
If you look at the second one - deletion, intersection, the start state, that also is phi.
Let us try let us try to understand the algorithm now.
This is our probability.
Similarly, at Ith hidden unit, it shows on the screen, the only difference is that it was one, the the second suffix was one which becomes I now.
Y is the amount of milk in five gallon jug.
So, that kind of meaning can be derived out of a statement, which was not possible using any other method before and this may in fact, if the proper statements are there before this particular statement is invoked, probably the CD representation will be will be such that the the Purochan tried to burn Laksha Gruha to make sure Pandavas health becomes minus ten.
We'll talk about that.
Next one is minus four.
So, sometimes the search spaces are not finite.
So, you can look at the next slide.
okay , I can tell that your king is under attack and king has no place to move.
Second thing, if I say, show me a move .
You cannot solve the problem in real time.
Okay , now we're talking about the third case - The eight gallon jug and three gallon jug.
Three sixty different for a small problem like this only seven cities there are total three sixty tours possible.
Okay the hidden unit total N inputs are provided.
In case number one we have zero zero, both jugs are empty.
And there are two type of methods, guided and unguided.
We pick up six which is best, Okay , this is what we’re doing.
You can fill this thing and whatever is remaining you you can keep here.
You have to continuously check whether the performance of the system is improving or not.
Let us look at the first method called Partially mapped crossover.
One learns to become active and there is a slanting line moving from left to right up.
Then you can place on top BA and then you get on BA.
So you don’t add them in the explored array and that’s the reason we’re keeping that array, clear nose Okay .
GA is about representing problems in in form of a solution space.
There are many paths D to E, D to F then G and E and so on there are many paths which we are not going to look at those paths.
In fact, it is quite possible that when you take the feedback from users, they just discard it.
A B C D is farmer, fox, chicken, grain.
You can see this.
Welcome friends, to the tenth module of AI .
What does that mean?
Now A B C D is what?
And the very, very important if the expert feels so and the knowledge engineer feels so, if both of them are in sync or they are not.
You can see that the body of part describes.
So, state space has some component and the end state also or the goal state also has some components.
But you will have to actually now how that is done?
But then there is a problem.
We just assume it to be there existing.
Because if you don't do this, it’ll not have that level of acceptance in user.
We have looked at some guided, two methods actually, hill climbing and Breadth First Search in in earlier module.
And then from five I get seven, I move, a seven, eight I can move up and so on.
Let me tell you that GA is a huge thing and what I am going to talk about is just we are just going to scratch the surface.
Now again , we’ll try to explore the left child which is 6,0,2, which again runs into trouble.
Now you can see that there is a node minus three, which is explored three, which is also explored now which is being explored right now .
And if you try running this program, looking for all possible alternatives, calculating the the the the length of the path probably the program will not end in your lifetime. okay .
Opponent is going to play the minus three.
This is precisely what we are going to address in this module, how to search, how it is possible to search.
Okay , For example, we can’t move from zero zero to one zero in case number one because how will you get one zero? There is no measuring device available . You can't get that, Okay .
It is done by applying something called a heuristic function.
What are the additions?
So, the output is whether is your is the friend’s image or not.
Some presentations are simpler compared to others.
Then you cannot have fox and chicken both on the same side.
In fact, we have not stressed on one very critical aspect of state space called prerequisites.
‘First Jay went to watch the match.
In in most cases, you won’t have the luxury of having that much amount of memory to store all those nodes there.
And it can combine sequences for better and non-isolated kind of reasoning.
Those problems were quite structured, quite structured in the sense that we can define something called a start state, something called a ninth state, we can define states space and we can define rules which can let us move around in state space, moving from start state to the end state.
Now let us see how you can define rules or moves .
Okay , learning is a process which for for getting such a weight which can identify every input as correctly.
Because it's very, very hard to characterize.
It propagates the errors back.
How static evaluation function gets its value?
First of all, let us look at the basic brain neuron, okay .
So, he the translator is converting that Hindi sentence into a french sentence.
We begin with zero zero and you can see the sequence on the slide.
Suppose if I I just pick up all cities, finding out distances between them.
Now, let us look at syntactic rule number six.
If you do not want to do it, just negate it.
It tries all possible way to explore the search surface and get the the solution.
Okay
For example, all the praise the like deer, what they do?
This is because of lot of advancement in this particular field this neural network.
Dependencies also are possible to be modified using some small indicators.
Now, this is the problem .
cheu All that is done, now we are going to putting it on on paper, we are finalizing it and you will have to have a tentative plan ready now.
The next one D you can see that it is replaced G, D is the mapping.
That process also is very simple, very logical.
A question asked why Manoj gave Rajan a chocolate.
Depending on the condition that I use for choosing them, I can have less number of nodes or more number of nodes, depending on the function that I choose.
Explore two plies, B is the worst move.
But in real case real problem case we have plenty of rules.
Next one is ten.
One of them is hill climbing.
Hearing few words of music and recollecting the entire song is the other.
Then curved can have big curves and small curves, and round, can have long rounds and small rounds and so on and so forth. Okay .
And the algorithm is shown here.
So, that these are all examples of primitives, in fact Schank added plan later.
When you say greater than average the context determine what's the value on on on an average.
I have already discussed them.
Ideally, it should mimic expert’s consultation model.
Now such kind of, if else, is possible using something we'll see and we'll see examples of all of them C is conditional, C indicates that the relationship is conditional, if this happens that will happen, if else, kind of if, then kind of a relationship.
I've already told you theres the other one which is quite powerful is called simulated annealing, is an excellent example of how one can innovate from some other domain.
Look at the first figure, talking about alpha cutoff.
But number of missionaries calculate two plus zero is two.
One three two one zero is possible . Why you you can just pour out three out of the jug.
So, he's doing something with that stick.
Apply the first rule, if it is better go to that node, Okay .
For example, if we we take up a detailed script which we have not done and we have talked about very, very simple script but assume that there is a detailed cricket match viewing script and we're talking about that script.
So here the location is also possible to be represented not only time the location can also be represented.
What we are going to do in this particular module, one more thing that we are planning to do is is called goal stack planning.
The statement is basically talking about few events.
Now, the first neuron here connects to first second and third.
In our case we are represented in a semi CD form where where you are only using that ACT and nothing else here.
Almost every ant will follow that path.
What we're going to do is, we are going to look at a problem called Missionary Cannibal problem.
What does it mean?
X one into W one one one.
We we have seen that is a limitation of CD .
And, it stops when there is no path ahead.
The structure is not only dynamic, the structure is also completely distributed, every neuron takes a decision on its own.
For example, I I if I found a statement that I went to Jungle Book yesterday and we enjoyed our dinner.
Knowledge engineer will decide the database structure and the knowledge structure and probably XML structure and all that but he is also not go to code.
A plausible move generator is a programme what what does it do?
First, a bad move is allowed with some probability, okay . And that probability changes over a period of time.
So, this actually, the third move you can see that C is better than B and B is better than A.
Each one of them and then find out the best out of it.
So many things to store.
We pick up we describe an action called place on table which contains only one argument, place on table A will pick up the A cube and put it on the table a block A and put it on table.
So, that's why the conventional search algorithms won't work here because conventional search algorithm will always pick up the best heuristic value which is not going to work here.
For example, Let us, we have few examples okay .
That row value is basically a function which checks for a threshold value.
If you if you look mathematically, a random set of N weight is a point in an N dimensional space.
Zero is the depth, we begin with zero and the current player who am malam player or the other one.
I’ve already told you that it is possible to have multiple final states and here we can.
So, either B or F is zero.
If you know how to write heuristic function whatever we’re going to talk about is perfectly alright.
I just got these four values, their path; path is not very important, but then value is very important, because based on this value I'll decide which path to choose , which move to choose. okay .
The question that one may ask is this branch and bound is great.
In fact, it is possible for a neural network to solve any problem it can learn.
But in case of this thing , expert system, you probably have more than one beta releases and so on so forth.
Now currently the knowledge is almost always coded in some form of classes because classes offer lot of advantages like inheritance and so on.
Back propagation algorithm is something which is used to train neural networks.
Ravan is dead means his health is reduced to minus ten, what was it earlier, maybe greater than minus ten.
You can say Sachin gave his bat to Sarfaraz. So Sachin ATRANS okay you can look at that representation.
That mean again assume that your input, the state space is is presented in a way that is a collection of some components.
Similarly, ‘fly’ also involves something else happening. ‘Fly’ means you you you took a plane to reach to that place, so that is the additional information.
Okay for example, here he has to wait for fifteen minutes and that angers him.
So, this also is a valid state.
It’s pretty dynamic .
So, when you when you learn something to the contrary of what whatever is mentioned in the script, they no no longer be there in the script which is activated, Okay .
There is no ontology.
What you're supposed to do is to provide some images of G with and some images without that horizontal line.
Second one is very easy to understand.
That method is pretty good if you're able to use your heuristics better, okay .
Do you need an additional expert for it?
The reason is that if you do it that way, remember with every move you will have to explore the search tree and how to apply static evaluation function to all leaf nodes.
We’ll explore the right child of the parent , that is 1,5,2, again a left, 1,4,3 1,4,3 then we have 4,4,0.
Now this is not love, you can understand that you're not representing love but that's not the problem of CD ,
In this particular module we extend our discussion about planning that we had earlier in the previous module.
The other example is Ravan is dead.
So that is that can predict, Okay .
Now lot of I do not want to again describe the difference between soft computing and AI
What does that mean?
This basically is derived from a area which is quite unrelated to artificial intelligence, called metallurgy.
Similarly, if you want to get zero you will have to get negative infinity which is also impossible, so it it continues to learn even if it has learnt that thing correctly.
Great! See, now try to understand it is L M one C one, R M two C two and BL.
You may traverse a very long path and get a solution, it’s pro probably if you’d have traversed on the other side probably you’ll get it much earlier, but that’s it.
So, you can see that the representation in the handout that Dhoni and PROPEL they they are connected like before - actor and action, but here we are talking about an object which is being acted upon, okay .
An interesting thing here is like the first case is inserted, you test the system, second case is inserted, you test the system for both cases, third case is inserted, you test the cases test the system for third case and all that.
In case number one, we say that it is the summation is beyond greater than the threshold value, there is a problem okay the sorry greater than the threshold value it it’s a friend, but we provide something else and it still the summation is beyond that.
Now how have I decided those fifty images?
I’ve already talked about this, the the string X which are interested in checking and all this thing . If it does not hold the process will not stop.
When the rule is complex, we have seen that we need to write less number of rules which are general.
So, in either case, this particular sequence is not useful.
There are some charts which can tell you whether an activity is to follow some other activity or an activity can happen in parallel with some activity and so on so forth, depending on their prerequisites, their requirement and all that.
Okay .
In case of twenty six cities, twenty five factorial by two total number of alternatives are possible that comes out to be something I can't even read,
Regression is relevant - again it is moving in the right direction.
How we do it?
We look at the Tic Tac Toe position and decide whether it is win loss or draw okay .
It works like a geologist who looks at the sample of earth and do something with it, they tries to figure out what it contains, Okay , the kind of material and all that .
So, we have applied rule number two.
An excellent example is, let us look at this particular tour A, B, C, D, E, F, G and again A.
So, what he did, he wrote a neural network based program.
Mahesh.
After a while they realize, oh, we are doing this.
You cannot apply any rule anytime.
So, let's talk about.
But that’s the reason why I have chosen a different set of string.
Which move and why?
So, for placing suppose if my queen is under attack somewhere and I have two possible moves, I can save my queen one, I can place this pawn one step further at this position.
But if you have two thousand cities or five thousand cities or e..e.. even one hundred cities, it is going to be impossible because the number of permutations and combinations are too much for you to actually do it.
How many output units do I need?
Recombination, now those five are to be matted together; recombine together to produce next generation that is called recombination.
So, this again is an invalid state, okay .
And it had around eight thousand components in the static evaluation function of that Deep Thought computer which could beat Gary Kasparov, had eight thousand components.
Those bits are what, zero and one.
So there is no question of invoking that script.
You can't backtrack and then redo it.
Milkha Singh PTRANS himself to some other location or I PTRANS myself to some other location.
After ten iterations.
Now this is good for pedagogy purpose but in true sense this will be a complete CD representation.
So that is what we are going to look at.
This is the the representation.
You've seen in the last module that whenever we we encounter some statements, they they do not only refer to that single case but they represent complete scenario,for example, when I say that I went to watch a match, I not only talk about viewing a match but I talk about many other things like I whenever I, for example, that that happens in normal communication as well.
It is about picking up a random state and checking if it is a solution.
And when you consider the threshold, you also have X zero W zero, where X zero is basically one.
You can take the grain on the other side.
So if it is winning for us, losing for us or a draw, we have already seen these those three cases.
Okay , the rest is simple.
You can see that some part from parent one, some part from parent two.
In fact it is done, I I talked about friend, now I can talk about something similar called recognizing faces of employees of a company.
We begin with state called eight zero zero, the initial state.
The rule number thirteen.
Then example, you say that Jay watched the match and come back home by bus.
Because the interface basically is to be used by the user and not the expert or knowledge engineer.
So, we can’t do it and in in that case this heuristic is going to be quite useful.
But there is one more example.
So, it says that the bullet travels from gun, went into the hostage.
You have been to a place long back and you visiting again.
And level, if you look from the levels of tree, it is two but number of nodes it’s three. clear nose Okay .
Deletion is on AB will be deleted and now on AB will no longer be true.
We are not going to discuss that further.
But the other requirement.
What the point here is that you can decide that slope on of an activation function for if you want to learn faster and all that.
You can say yes, yes great
So, that is called positive misclassification, okay .
And sometimes you need to have more number of epochs, depending on the complexities of the images that you provide.
So, it’s reiterates re-strengthens the pheromone volume.
We have already seen examples of a general and specific roles.
We apply first rule, we get minus five.
That means X Z value can be maximum three , the initial state is eight zero zero, Okay .
We begin from L three three, R zero zero and BL.
But here it is not possible in square.
okay , there are a lot of things.
We are going in utmost detail means every component of the problem is clearly defined and told that this is to be solved.
But how do you search using branch and bound?
And calculate the value P which is probability one plus E raised to minus delta E upon T.
And again, if the script writer is good enough, it it could get this information that why one can get bored?
Now if you, if you look at this, which value out of that will be be passed up?
okay So, planning also is part of formalization and also like if you have taken some OR course, you probably know what I'm talking about.
So, we have to calculate the difference.
And when I have a boat on the left hand side I can only apply rule number one.
So that's zero. So X zero Y plus Z .
Only modifies the act.
That's the previous level.
We'll We'll apply We'll have to provide this current state because unless we provide current state you will not be in a position to apply PMG to it and generate children.
It’s not an object, okay .
Now if you using pure Hill Climbing, you can't move forward.
We’ll begin with three types of situation which is the outcome of Tic Tac Toe.
So it's quite obvious.
N is not possible to determine we’ll have to go further NL.
Irrespective of the sign.
Okay for example, I'm I'm Im using a depth first search.
I’m actually incrementing the heuristic value.
I try one more .
You will design the database first or knowledge base or you're going to write the rules or you’re going to collect those rules and if there are more than one experts, how you're going to sync those rules and so on so forth.
Now you cough please understand.
And then we want all missionaries on the other side and then moving cannibals on the other side.
You can see that such characteristics are very, very important for survival.
The other one are the links, those links are are known as dependencies and very rightly so, because it talks about how one object is dependent on the other one.
So, the the terrorists become the actor and the hostage become the recipient, okay .
These methods are are , either preserving order or position or both in a way that they allow better qualities of the parent to persist over the generation.
This is the same problem like you you have in other disciplines and for which you require standardization and all that.
So, A is to be placed on table, then you achieve free B.
clears nose First time, we have already seen generating a state space.
In this case we’ll have only eighty one, nine nine into nine is eighty one inputs.
For every children, the second step though is non leaf, will consider it to be leaf and proceed further.
So, that is not part of the start state, first condition is not satisfied.
You can see that first scene is going to a stadium the second scene is buying a ticket, the third one is going inside stadium and sitting on a seat, taking your seat then watching a match and then exiting.
We begin from initial state and reach to the final state.
So you can choose the book that suits your domain, look for heuristic function or try writing for yourself but otherwise it's it’s simple.
Based on these two it comes back with static evaluation function value.
And if it’s not there I’ll look at my table drawer and if it’s not there I’ll search for my daughter, Okay .
This also is not very good, Okay .
And one great thing about MOP is that because it stores everything together, it can relate two different things and and one example of a program called Swale is very interesting.
Next three , we are moving missionaries.
When the errors are propagated back, the weights are adjusted accordingly which we discussed in a previous module.
So, props also change, default set of props, obviously are there but additional you may have them additional ones.
The same process actually is used in simulated annealing.
But then you can’t move further.
So, these are the A's which are provided to the system and you can see that in this case some of the it’s pretty crude representation but it's still possible for us to understand how it works.
For example, one is called recipient case relationship, when the ownership is transferred.
The goal stack planning or GSP as I've told you earlier, is using this, component by component, pick up each component, putting on the stack and solve it.
Why it’s called local?
Toh , With that note, would like to conclude this module.
So, such things, such moves such states are better compared to others.
Because, we’re not reached to the final goal state.
Ten is the maximum and minus ten is the minimum value, so when you say health equal to minus ten, the person is dead.
They pick up something else and test and so and so forth, and that's called generate and test.
The sense that our neurons are constantly dying since birth.
Maximum values of missionary and cannibal can be two.
Thank you!
So, this value describes weight of which layer, okay .
There is nothing in between.
So, we would like to increase cohesion in the segment and reduce coupling between segments.
If it is not phi that means you’ve deleted something which is part of the goal state.
We have seen three representations but believe me there are hundred odd representations one can easily write, even more, potentially infinite in fact.
And if you look from that angle, it is one two four and eight .
That is the meaning.
So, what we are doing we we say that this previous state I use this action okay to get this previous state.
The same thing happens here as well.
So, that's a very, very critical part of this.
That R which is again a three-prong structure which is R indicates is a recipient case relationship.
deep breath And now what we want to have is only four gallons of milk in that particular jug.
There there are other cough there are other objects- menu and rate card or menu and tablecloth, plates and glasses and so on so forth.
There is something called state and I've talked about that state a little earlier, when you said that health equal to minus ten, you're talking about state of a variable, state of something which is between minus ten to ten.
So, unlike hill climbing it does not get stuck.
But when you say that Sarfaraz took the bat from Sachin, you can see that the statement representation does not remain the same ap the rest of that is absolutely the same but you can see that the actor changes from Sachin to Sarfaraz.
If this node is better than this I’ll just go, that’s called hill climbing.
Actions are the vehicle which enables us to do this.
That's what I was talking about when I say when I said that the CD captures the meaning and represents the meaning rather than the words themselves.
I have two strings.
So, number of hidden units you need are twenty two.
The the ants which carry that food are coming back on the same trail.
There is something which stores the current state, there has to be something which stores the current state.
We cannot have more, why?
So, this is an example where you can use back propagation neural network.
That many huge number of nodes.
The difference is that the instrument is is helps this thing to occur, okay .
Okay , but then there is a catch, catch is you have ordered them in this way fashion on A table and on BA.
The actors can be of two different types.
The object is stick.
For example, if an an ant is travelling and it has two different paths and one with higher pheromone value, other with less pheromone value it’ll understand that more ants have travelled along this path and this path is more recent, will probably pick up that path, okay .
The problem of hill climbing is that you end up in a local maxima.
We do not have heuristic function here.
Is one more thing.
With that we’ll come to an end of this module.
For goal director reasoning it is the opposite.
So if it is the case, BFS and DFS will not stop.
how can we provide that?
The advantage is that we'll be able to generalize any size any any orientation anywhere, if you got two different slanting lines in different direction and a horizontal line it is A.
You will be surprised where is that farmer present, not present and all that has gone.
For example, if you want to recognize a signature, the problem itself is quite fuzzy, not only the problem is fuzzy though we are able to effectively solve that problem, we will be able to recognize a signature, we’ll not be able to tell exactly how we have done it.
So that is called nearest neighbour.
So there are two options W and L.
Height is example of a state okay .
One, we have minus three and minus four.
Now which move to choose given some alternatives is pretty hard problem.
It should follow exactly how a doctor should the patient should consult a conventional doctor, okay , the same way if he can or little better acceptable.
With that we’ll come to an end of this particular module .
The sigmoid function you can see is, is S shaped.
With that we come to an end of this module.
We'll have to do something.
What about chicken and grain?
So, we’ll have only two different types of images.
what you do is you just let them roam around in the real space,
Okay .
Now everything is assumed you can see that in single statement, I'm talking about multiple things together the complete scenario now when you talk about scripts, scripts are these scenarios, Okay
Now this is a a mixture of CD representation as well as the the normal language.
Bstar is little different.
Obviously, plausible move generator and static evaluation functions are assumed to exist.
So, we we have a question mark there and this is again, remember, the question mark is an important this thing here, okay .
Tears.
What does that mean?
You can't you should not be going beyond that limit and we'll be discussing about that soon.
It changes the properties of the genes on the permanent basis.
So this this process allows those characteristics ability to climb, ability to swim and all that in in the offspring.
There are few strategies which are quite simple as I said, but quite useful as well.
The case number one, placing CD on the table the action was not relevant.
You'll have to manage uncertainty.
Okay So that is fine.
Testing and evaluation comes next.
Well, let us take the third rule.
How it is done?
So, the question is, should we define rules which cannot use for solving a problem?
Similarly, E F G H not equal to six, twelve and four.
Why that static evaluation function is needed and all that also we’ll be looking at in this particular module.
So, point is just this.
How it is done?
C is free but D is not free.
okay even if some pieces are there in between knight, you know those does not create obstacle for a knight.
Patient, doctor, whatever. Relation between those classes, which classes are a superclass, which class is a subclass and which class is used by others and so on, so forth.
So, and then they narrow it down and then try all possible cases generate and test there.
I can sacrifice queen for this pawn because this pawn is more important for for me right now.
Now it's not always a great thing to do but then most cases you don't have other option Okay .
But you can see that even in that case there are only two alternatives: one alternative is simple where you achieve one, the other one is achieved.
Once, that is done we’ll able to recognize my signature much more correctly, okay so that’s how it is done.
So capacity of Y is five so you can have five or less and Z less than or equal to three .
The other thing is also there, I've I’ve used my own order.
There are two children, neither of them has better value and they're stuck.
What it does is pretty complex.
Here an example is Abdul decided to earn more money.
The experts are involved in this process.
I already discussed that.
The back-propagation algorithm is one of the most commonly used algorithm and that's why we are going to stress about how that functions and how one can use that algorithm for solving problems which otherwise not possible to be used, not possible to be solved by other means.
So, that is this function.
He received the news of sad demise of his grandfather and returned back now.
How that is done is the essence of this ant colony optimization.
So, you can see that it is it is possible for somebody to conclude something like that, because it is provided here.
It returns NodeInfo.
Brian solves many problems without algorithm.
Please understand, and this is not only in the case of missionary cannibal.
Welcome friends in the eighth module of AI , genetic algorithms and travelling salesman problem.
okay Nothing else is different, you can see that.
Okay to the same statement that we've seen in in in case of rule one is represented here as as an additional.
Regression is coming back from the goal state.
The meaning is that Nobita is doing something with the stick, which enables which which is an instrument for Nobita to eat rice.
So or for example a match, viewing a match, a track is a cricket match so you're talking about basically cricket match viewing Okay ?
You have seen that AI is possible to be solved the problems of AI are possible to be solved using a method called State Space, where we can define the these problem states in in a State Space.
Now that is called simple single point crossover.
Where M one greater than or equal to C one.
The best applying that thing will get us best static evolution function value and that will pass up by and that's quite interesting.
You probably have seen that thing yourself and we’re going to write, we’re going to discuss about the algorithm which does the same thing.
And we we let us take the case of seven cities and we pick up a city as a root node and you just start travelling like you do.
Okay , and it’s also subjective.
what are the components for solving this problem?
Minus three and two now they’re explored.
Check it! Number of missionaries three, number of cannibals three.
Now what you do is, now you have those offspring, the older one are are thrown away,
So, it it begins with planning out all differences then insert all the components on the goal stack.
So, in the beginning we'll we’ll we'll look at the 0,5,3 then 3,5,0 is right child and then 8,0,0 is right child. Okay . That is precisely what we’re doing.
You can see that.
If you are not very good in mathematics probably it looks little hard to understand but this is not so, please try to understand.
Genetic algorithm is little different from conventional AI techniques that is recently added; in fact it is some other researchers do not call it part of AI .
So, what you need to do is to travel in N dimensional space from the randoms point that you start with to the goal state.
I don't feel like that.
If that parent cannot produce the next child then parent to parent is taken up.
So, it is quite possible.
Okay , the other method which we are going to see is called Beam search.
And that was very time consuming.
okay .
But anyway chess is better program to be managed compared to many other programs.
C is what?
It's it’s not that easy.
Okay , So, what we do now?
Sometimes, even direction is to be mentioned.
In fact, branch and bound is possible to be used with other algorithms as well.
Our search is an associative way is one more.
F is also copied, Okay .
So, that it’s very important that you also involve user into this process.
But those are all things which are part of the representation.
So, this is very, very important.
What does that mean?
It should generate the children.
What we do not want is fox and chicken.
There are some components which are there in state space, the initial state space there, are some components in the final state space.
The seven-step solution.
So, that is the second thing and nothing else is possible if you opt for a draw okay .
So what you do?
There is no standard as such.
So, when you say Mahesh hurt Jayesh is is one conceptualization which is happening, and its use is okay okay as an object okay .
So, place on top BA requires you to move from the previous state to the current state, actually you're doing the other way round you okay but it it is to be described this way.
Because that domain is more unstructured and probably this thing , the system itself is less structured as well.
We’ll again stress this thing once we talk about how anything is represented in CD .
So we use that word here, as well.
okay?
We explore the leftmost 3,5,0 and left with 0,5,3.
And there are similar cases.
Look at the slide, three missionaries and three cannibals to cross the river with only one boat.
In the beginning, usually you have a sparse neighbourhood and then you go in depth you have a a dense neighbourhood.
And it says that I'm adding something which is part of the goal state, which is not phi.
Annealing schedule is basically how you're going to cool the alloy down.
Check if the precondition pre previous state is relevant.
Now, an important something little different which little different than the conventional State-space search that we’ve seen so far.
Okay the beginning you you you just insert all nodes in an array and other unexplored node in the other array and find out the best node from the array.
Now how come we have this state?
okay I I could also have specified current I I only . okay current state only , but providing player will give me a better idea about how good or bad that function is.
What are the processes involved, what exactly a doctor going to do, what exactly a patient going to do, who is going to do with the expert system, who is going to provide what to expert system, who expects what from expert system and so on so forth is done in the prototype construction phase.
If I apply to two, thirty-five into thirty-five states.
So, the Guided Search Methods are not something which is different than unguided, they're they are Unguided Search Methods with the use of heuristics.
For example, we have assumed that eight,zero,zero is the beginning this thing a move, Okay .
It is not about a searching through state space, no.
And many a times it happens that both of them take various case studies and see how expert solves that case.
Again this is a very very important issue when you write any recursive algorithm.
So, this is a relevant state relevant progression.
Ideally the sample should contain everything that could be there, for example, if my signature is to be recognized and I I will have to actually try writing my signature twenty, thirty, forty, fifty times and hopefully it should cover all all different variations I I produce while I sign okay .
Okay so that that is something which is which is very common and seeing across all life forms.
So, heuristic function should have two important characteristics, should closely match the the the real value and should be as fast as it it can be.
It's called Memory Organized Pockets.
How can one write the moves, the the eleven twelve moves, how can you start from the initial state, apply moves and restore solution
Not only leave-alone expert system, every system requires that.
ok The initial state in case of chess, all of us know what that initial state is, that is passed to.
This function is known as as activation function.
Now this is a small story that is presented to the problem solver using this thing script.
It’s as simple as the previous one.
Why?
Once they do it, once they are able to mimic the human brain, they are able to do many other things.
Toh it cannot come down directly.
A statement, for example, Ram loves Sita or Ram found Sita loving or or or something like that.
Unlike that frames are quite similar.
How how important is the the central control and how important it is to have occupy a specific position in chess and so on so forth.
And then you send farmer farmer and chicken on the other side.
So none of them is a solution but we cannot go.
I when I suggest a patient to to get X-ray, how many times I’m I'm right in in saying so because at that point of time the fracture evident.
One outcome is that I provide image of the friend and it recognizes it correctly.
For example, if you have one cannibal, you can send one missionary with it.
They travel along that and again, they start travelling in a random fashion but usually along the obstacle.
Why we need that?
One, I may provide the image of my friend but the output says he is not.
But anyway, well , I'll talk about that example soon.
And it can actually help cause effect determining cause effect relationship as well.
And in fact, a single statement might require multiple conceptualization.
There is somebody who is going to code this thing in Java or C++ or Python or something.
It is able to solve lot of problems for example recently Google provided a solution, you you you just look at the image and can ask for something which is otherwise is just impossible.
It is x zero w zero plus x one w one and so on and it is greater than zero, then it fires, less than zero, it does not.
Every rule has some prerequisite.
If it is not phi, good; the state is relevant.
We’ll see an example.
So, you can see that EXPEL is is the verb which is being used here, okay .
The method is is applied in a way that the the all all alternate alternative state is possible, all all all children of a node they are tested and and checked if one is better than the other.
Many times, the things look pretty complex on the face of it.
You can see that I saw the match, I watched the match and so on so forth, all similar statements will have similar representation, but the saw match represent the same thing I watched a match and I MTRANS match where the the recipient case relationship from my eyes to my conceptual processor CP.
And please understand that there are seventeen odd rules that we are going to look at.
And in this particular simple script I've talked about scene scenes which are normal, expected or default sequences of events which is which are likely to happen when the script is invoked.
Now if there is a cycle in the solution path you may not reach to a solution because cycle may go on forever.
But for some other problems that is a better method we’ll see that thing in in in our eighth module when we look at genetic algorithms.
It allows a bad move with some probability.
So you’ll have to try an alternate, Okay .
So this is what I get A, B, C, D, G, F, I, H, E so this is what I get.
There is the other algorithm which also is quite useful.
Mad is minus ten, ecstatic is plus ten, so on and all other things are in between.
Remember branch and bound prefers the nearer, this thing , the nodes.
Once this is done, I'm entering into the next phase.
In this case eighty-one input units because it is a nine into nine matrix.
Okay , so that is the next statement you can see which is is a three-prong structure which represents the state change, Ravan’s health is now minus ten.
Remember it it applies back propagation algorithm for learning where the errors are propagated back.
Simulated annealing is is a method where you allow the worst move from the the current move unlike hill climbing with a typical amount of probability that is derived from physical process of annealing and uses almost similar method for choosing how much with how much how how many how much probability you allow the the incorrect move sorry not incorrect it is less this thing a worse move from a current current move and so on.
Now that's the representation .
So you can easily understand.
So, that means great.
When that particular node that you’re planning to choose is explored a little further it is called secondary search.
Pretty simple?
As I said, eight thousand components were there in that thing , and it was very, very powerful.
So in there you don't have a children.
Okay , when we do that what happens?
let them win or survive themselves and those who survive after some time, collect them and made them.
So, free B on A table okay this is additional.
So, what you do is as an HR manager, you would like to have to strategies designed and defined to make sure that they have more tendency to retain in the organization.
That also is mentioned in this particular rule okay .
And there are a few prerequisites.
In fact, if you have played Tic Tac Toe yourself, the best move is to occupy the center in the beginning, why because you have degree of freedom.
It indicates the relation between two picture producers or two objects.
They are able to do it.
We’ve seen the earlier cases, the repeated nodes and and the nodes which are already explored.
Then you add total collective pheromone added by the ants in the current cycle so, that is delta tau T plus one.
Now the answer is that what we do is we’ll reduce the weights of every case where xi is non-zero.
But despite all this, the basic things that I'm going to talk about is the same.
If you have lost your path, you will prefer to walk on a trail, Okay .
Thank you!
Remember, we are discussed about the dictionary approach somewhere back and machine learning that we are going to look at next contains something similar.
So, an important job here is to see whether we have invoked a script.
And the third one.
We do not want any cycles in the solution path.
Okay , the rule number eight talks about the place where the conceptualization occurs.
If the keys are there, I’ve got the solution, I quit.
Okay , and then there are some scenes. The scenes are you can see that quite interestingly P PTRANS P to the stadium.
It looks at all possible moves, next to next moves and next to next moves and so on as long as the time permits and out once it it is done it'll return back which move is better for me.
So, from that newspaper it is going into my mind and when you talk about Schank, who developed this and his team, the the team members who developed this, use three different parts of brain, one is long term memory which retains everything that is remembered, short term memory and and a conscious processor that something which processes the information.
Second, which are yet to be explored and the third which which we are considering right now, Okay .
It’s calling PMG and PMG generates children for that particular node.
You may you may ask why the function is called objective rather than heuristic?
We are into twentieth module of AI and we'll be discussing about some prerequisites for the MiniMax algorithm to be applied and a few other algorithms also, the prerequisites are just fine.
If you if you go back and look at your our exploration of eight five three gallon water jug problem or if you explore this three four gallon water jug problem and so on so forth, you will find that in most cases the rare number of nodes are are more likely to yield to solution, yield solution.
The explanation is is very critical here.
Because only administrator will be able to give rights to these developers and testers and all that.
If the ant has travelled some other path without having a food source, will not going to come back the pheromone value will evaporate.
fine.
We are changing states component by component, we changed one component, second, third.
Here also we use small agents which are used collectively to solve complex problems.
But mutation is very important.
Sometimes, somebody do have but usually our brains are capable of making sure, even if the neurons die, they do not lose data.
Eight five three gallon water milk jug problem is little different.
‘Ran yesterday’ and ‘ran fast’, what's the difference?
And and again, I will say that only two consecutive states.
They travel along their own generated path but then there are two outgoing lines for the third ant.
We are now into thirtieth module of AI .
The system wants to learn whether it has to cook for Jay or not and there is no mention.
We’ll begin with something called Variable neighbourhood descent.
Number of hidden units is taken as a geometric mean of input and output.
Every node represents some state some typical word uttered by speaker and you're trying to like translate that statement.
You better look at the handout which which clearly and there's one more thing here I’ve not represented hurt as a a a CD representation.
It can be even more complicated.
So, progression and regression are quite important thing for planning and there is one more thing which is called relevant.
So that is T value is decided by designers intuitions and judgement and it is done empirically.
We’re stuck, we cannot move forward and we’re not at the solution.
We like to explore a search space much faster and real time. So well well use sparse neighbourhood.
And there is one situation which we are going to talk about.
Same way, the output unit all inputs all hidden units connected to it, they are they are all multiplied, HY WY, HI WIJ, In fact IJ if this is the Jth unit, HI JI, H one J J , assume this is J clears nose .
So, we will not be exploring that here.
The parent one, first element, first city is A and the mapping says A should be replaced by E.
Okay , so that's the point here.
And whatever is remaining is is here.
In the case number two, when you try to achieve one the it takes more time because it is not that straightforward.
Rajan told Manoj if he did not give him chocolate, he will not let him pray play with his friends.
Okay . You may have your own, completely your own set of primitives, you can still solve the problem, but this is an excellent solution.
So, you don't need to look for symptoms of malaria or typhoid and all that.
So, if I do that, I I have to step away from only labelling, I'll have to give some value and that value when we we give that value we call it static evaluation function which is quite similar to heuristic function.
The farmer is represented by one, the fox is represented by two, the chicken is represented by four and grain is represented by eight.
And if you have that context ready, the ontology is ready, how the objects are related?They’re ready.
When we try to make sure that when farmer is not around this two combination is also difficult to express in fact.
Now we’ll have to plan one after the other.
You may try one more function.
If this match is a football match, you probably have other roles like the linemen and the referees and and so on and so forth.
You need a powerful server and with this this kind of knowledge extraction process, which can tell you exactly what this packet is doing.
what is happening in remember, remembering basically converts something or or transfers something which is there in CP , into long term memory or short term memory.
So, that is missing here.
where we had only few nodes to explore and we could get the answer.
And where there's some guided search already applied in the problem domain it becomes so small that you can you cannot worry about you don’t need to worry about heuristic, you just try exploring all possible option and solve them.
Now let us look at the summary of what we have looked at this module, in the heuristic search module.
Now that's the other word which is being used.
In the next module, we are going to look at a script, something which addresses the lacuna that we have seen here.
And there is there are other methods which uses Depth-first search.
Now we are going to talk about GAs in an algorithm, genetic algorithm.
We look at their characteristics and somehow relate people with similar characteristics together and then group them together, that grouping or clustering of of inputs also is very important, and that also is type of learning, that’s called unsupervised learning, okay .
Now, let us take one more action called place on top.
for an example I've already given later part of the game when it's pretty crucial.
And the function obviously is called heuristic function rather than objective function.
Now, two important characteristics of best first search.
When you say ‘ran fast’, it it the fast does not add to the entire conceptualization.
And Offspring the child, the children’s genome basically is a combination of parents.
The same way, every middle unit is connected to every output unit and if it has more than one layer, the same thing is applied.
So that is false.
All these things are there and then you also have exit conditions or results, Okay .
Because we are not sure what what is unravelling later.
Then you should be able to explain me.
The conceptualization is over and now I'm going to formalize my system.
So, that final meaning is lost, okay .
And this connections are dynamic, they change over a period of time and this connections are weighted , they they contain weights and this weights basically carries the knowledge that we have in our brain.
There is no search .
So that is related, that the relation is indicated by an arrow and an O object, okay .
okay And B L or B R, B L means boat on the left side and boat on the right side.
Now whether rules are properly executed, whether you need to reschedule the order of the rule, whether you need to fine tune those rules, that also is to be properly properly done.
No, sometimes it is not.
So, you can use them.
okay So, that's exactly happening next.
So, this is one example.
Similarly, the middle part of parent one is copied into child two.
And it is quite possible that one expert gives a different list, the other expert gives a different list.
Population is a word which is known used what we have.
So the bike is an object for this PROPEL action, okay .
Now again, a critical difference is that unlike the earlier case, it is not yes- no thing.
Everybody can row the boat.
They won’t start from initial state and reach to final state.
Neural network is come out of AI , is no longer part of AI actually, but still people talk about Neural Network when they talk about AI , Neural network has become a discipline on its own.
That conceptualization is Mahesh propelling a stone to Jayesh and you can see that there is a direction indicator as well it’s going from somewhere to Jayesh the object is stone.
But then why we use word static evaluation function?
Let me repeat that both the components as well as the associated weight is experts’ decision.
Obviously they’re needed.
We are going to address a simpler problem of how one can represent using a state space.
Okay , so you just see if if pawn at this place and the next next block is empty, then you just move that pawn there.
So, that is very critical here.
The ant is very simple agent with very few functions and wilt has which has very limited intelligence.
The first one is a discrete function, you can see that the second one is not discrete, it is continuous.
And there are many problems with CD .
If it is satisfied, it is fine but if any component is not satisfied it’s again inserted on the stack.
So, something which is removed should not be there in the goal state or if it is there in the goal state, we have done something wrong because we wanted and we have removed it
We'll look at one more problem called eight five three gallon milk jug problem.
Now you choose six but then there are no rules possible in this case.
Okay , so state space in that case is pretty complex.
See what we have done.
please understand, that's the problem of language.
So, this is an important thing okay and a very simple description of an action - place on top XY, three things, every action is described in this three different using these three different attributes in in PDDL .
So, what I do is I provide images of five different friends of mine and I want the neural this neuron to learn to classify them.
So can we go to some other node?
So, you can get this thing done.
Now, why have I used double arrows, because it is something I found that thing somewhere in Schank’s paper.
Is is only the the the magnitude the sign which actually makes the difference but otherwise technically there's no difference.
Based on this, the inputs are provided to the back propagation algorithm.
Fortunately, for us the empirical studies the the practical solutions to this problem proved that it is actually possible for almost all cases.
Why when you do when you go for dense neighbourhood okay why We have already seen why sparse neighbourhood.
That is precisely what we are trying to do now.
Similarly, you can see the other example of mental state.
Current state is on A table on BA on CD on D.
Let me tell you that this neural networks began when there was no hidden unit.
The value is and remember static evolution function only applies at this place.
CD was devised long back, but still is not used to the extent it should.
We have also seen that it is possible to write multiple ways Okay .
But if I get a response from a medical system that you’ve got a blood cancer, I would ask, why, why you are telling me so?
You can see that the first line say x one, w one k, x two w two k.
We have seen that it is complex to write rules.
So, we get as near accurate as a heuristic value as possible.
I’m I won’t name Boman but I just say that there was a parsi actor, and you would immediately come back and tell me it was Dilwale, how did you do that, no sorry, it is Happy New year.
It depends on the complete conceptualization ‘the friend’ depends on complete conceptualization and not either MTRANS or I.
Now, the N value depends on the features that you take from the input.
So, the artificial neuron you can see that it is pretty simple design.
And in fact it should you should explore everything in in a systematic way.
First thing is initial value of temperature, when to reduce it and how much to reduce Okay , for example, initial value is twenty.
C has three B has two and E has again two, and now if you look at those values, B has two children, F is five and G is three, minus three.
So, five ply is deeper, six ply is deep, so that depth of that ply is indicated by current depth.
So those who use word objective function use word operator rather than rules.
It also aid adds a lot of additional information.
So you can have eight or less .
Okay , one more type of search is called Tabu search.
What is the value?
One is advantage that I've talked about multiple times is that multiple statements.
So, we have multiple statements with same meaning or similar meaning or same shade of meaning are are are derived into single similar representation.
Hello Friends! We have already seen few things about AI and search methods.
So this is the the partially mapped crossover method. Okay .
Scientists have not yet found a way to sync those processors in in a seamless way.
Now, and this these two conceptualizations have some relationship.
Friends, let us begin with the the second module.
Now, every other person now is roped in the team gets bigger and everybody is told about the system, everybody gets the idea about the system and will be very clear about their own role in the system, okay .
And today as I said, there is something called Deep Learning which is happening where you have lot of layers and there is a modified algorithm.
Then you will have to decide once that that basic questions are answered.
So, C is the first, so we copy C here, Okay .
I have few moves possible.
How it is done?
I I will not give you a silver bullet to solve this problem and nobody in the world can do it.
Our brain somehow in brain also works that way.
You assume that I I purchased a ticket, I I I went into the stadium I am seated on my seat, I view the match and and and looked at the toss then in first inning and the second innings hopefully I'm talking about ODI .
Based on that we pass the value up.
M two number of missionaries and C two number of cannibals on the right hand side of the river and the boat is on the left side.
Not in all cases those simple addition and subtractions are possible.
Even if you don’t know it’s still Okay .
So, this process , the algorithm which does all this, it the algorithm tells how you calculate the hind layer, that’s called activation, how what it what flows from the middle layer to the final layer and so on, so forth.
So, Ram ‘Do’.
So, that’s something quite similar to GA is happening.
It is completely distributed and all all neurons work in parallel.
What should I do? I just look at my pocket, if it’s there and where I am hanging my keys.
In fact testing, that’s what testing is.
So, it is it is something which says that one single hidden layer is is is suffice, is good enough for solving any problem.
Now, this is simplified version of the very function.
When we get value ten.
Now, what did Ram do?
We also have a final state.
Next one.
I'll pick up that move.
Whether the other experts are invited for additional components that you would like to add or not.
You check for abnormal cases as well, which is not possible in conventional cases.
Now, you may be surprised what that one is.
However silly it looks like that's our that's the way we do it.
So, very, very important thing is to have no redundancy in the knowledge.
Okay , and usually when you write a game playing program, play around with game playing program very often that function is known as move Move generator.
Welcome friends, to thirty fifth module of AI .
And thats that makes the the other elements available to us.
So, what we do is we first of all achieve X then Y and then Z and the problem is solved.
okay .
In the previous module, we have seen simple eight, five, three gallon water jug problem
okay .
So, if you choose say value P is point three so the probability of number generated less than point three is obviously point three.
So, when this happens, it is quite possible there are three possible outcomes.
I do not want to discuss more about why it is part of AI and why it is not.
So, that's the reason why documentation is very critical.
All four moves that I have all four moves says that it is N.
What does that mean?
There is no algorithm that you can talk about.
Physically, the square function look the same ,as shown on the slide.
There are many other methods.
And there is one more thing.
Both of them are misclassification.
Now we are substracting M.
They try to access the server, the server is not responding.
Now, applying this, two calculations place on table A dot addition intersection goal state, you can see that goal state on A table.
What is a branching factor?
For example, think of a robot domain.
I've told you that on A table is part of the goal state and that is what it is.
So, the first condition is satisfied.
For example, a cricket player usually are is taller than normal people.
In depth bound, you can assume some length, but this iterative deepening, it is it is only going to have one and not more.
When these three lines remain active, these three hidden units become active, the unit which wants to learn to become active and A is presented, will learn to become active.
So you just provide your and basically the heuristic is based on a simple method.
For example A, B, C, D, E, F, G is one tour and A, C, B, D, E, F, G is another tour.
How will you decide the hidden layer?
That's precisely what we're trying to stress here.
So, it can see that you you can see that X results into Y that results into Z and this relationship is going to help us getting the answer.
Okay Into one there is a structure called NodeInfo which the algorithm returns.
5,0,3 is already explored.
That person will not back it up okay ?
Why it’s called hill climbing?
So, if A plus E is one that means either A is one or E is one.
Now C and F, you can see that they are not part of the mapping and that is why they will have to be copied as it is.
But that will be tested in this case.
So I'll choose W and not L.
Then we have two options.
Okay so those paths are already found so that pheromone value will of a segment, okay , is equal to total number of ants travelled multiplied by the pheromone value that they have sprayed on that .
And you can see that they are also named as max.
We have X Y Z in in in the jug.
And remember this is a past tense.
Now, this is something very similar to which we have seen in the in the beginning, when we discussed about static evaluation function.
Also in the case of endgame you do that.
So, later on if somebody talks about bullets or guns or something, you can relate that to this thing, okay .
That makes it fourteen , that also is not allowed.
Now that part is to be represented.
Then again it goes up at that component.
Thank you.
So, it is possible that the different hidden units learn to remain active when there is a typical feature present in the file the present in the image.
Pick up better from that and continue like that.
Here, the artificial limit is pretty simple 3.
Do you decide whether this packet requires inspection?
We have an additional information here that ‘yesterday’ which you can see that it is represented here.
So, again they choose from either upper part or the lower part of the and we assume that it is it is done with equal probability.
And we have seen why a a function like sigmoid is used in some of the algorithms that neural network is using.
Obviously, the pheromone value on path one will be higher.
The game is over.
Hello friends, welcome to Module Five, Heuristic Search Methods in Artificial Intelligence series of modules.
There is something called Depth Bound Depth-first search.
We’ll just look at a typical sequence of states and see if it is a valid state, acceptable one, if not then we’ll pick up the something else and so on, that’s called perturbation search.
So,sometimes a normal rule of thumb Schank used in his paper he referred somewhere in his paper that whenever he encountered at least two heads, Okay in headers he’ll invoke that script.
And there are total paths, I have drawn all possible paths on the screen.
Is it valid?
And that that’ll help in generalization, because if you identify features irrespective of the input, the pixel value is, it it becomes possible, it it it makes it possible to generalize.
Free X and Free Y.
Which contain two things, the the best move that I take next and the paths, okay the the heuristic value, the complete path and the depth, okay two things.
We’re picking up the best child.
How converting one state into another requires complex processing.
Similarly, the carnivorous animals also, okay they can only survive if they run fast and they are better okay.
And then again you let them meet and generate twenty in the next iteration, I have already talked about.
The object is tears and it has direction relationship.
Why we do that?
Generate a random number R between zero and one, okay .
Now you can easily conclude that I must have much lesser than five hundred rupees by now, why because one of the requirements of dining in restaurant that you'll have to pay your bills.
We are not taking the earlier string.
Okay , because action always applies in forward direction.
That is what is is going to remain the same everywhere.
So you can see that the call is made to to MiniMax.
So we have a table which actually summaries summarizes all the primitives and their work.
Do you believe that the script watching a match will be invoked?
Now here is precisely what I'm doing.
You can just pour it inside and get it empty.
We we generate okay .
The third thing which I would like to talk about is I I use typical arrows, typical type of links which suits…which I found from those papers.
I can move to eight,zero,zero, .
One ply search is shown on in inferior twenty point one, it is it is shown you can see that A is explored and it's a max ply because it is the only one ply search you just play or move and get all straights possible.
What does it mean?
And you can see that for on BA you can add action called place on top BA and on A table you can put on table and now this is done.
In fact it can answer many many questions.
Okay , there's something called conceptual tense, which comes next there are single letter letter indicators, Okay , conceptual tenses for example, slash indicates negation, P indicates past tense, question mark indicates something which the information is not available, a kind of a placeholder, later, later on you might encounter, for example, you you encounter a statement like Sachin went to LA and then you probably will have a statement coming message, Sachin bought a a a necklace for his wife in Mumbai two days before.
One, is a three gallon water jug, the other one is four gallon water jug and we have ample supply of water.
okay , these words probably we are not going to use them anywhere else.
You can see that there are total eighty-one inputs out of it, some of them are zeros and some of them are one.
Okay .
This task is a prerequisite will have to be delayed.
And this is something which I've already explained.
We are multiplying it with minus one and pass it up. Why we are doing it?
For example, we decide that X, Y and Z needs to be achieved for going from a start state to the end state.
Not only that, it's kind of pick keeping the best so far node as well.
So that is how we do it like that is called constructive search.
Similarly, you can write, you can see the move, which moves from right to left.
At L Gr grain is also on the left hand side.
That sometimes happens due to radiation or some external this thing also, input also.
Farmer or not farmer?
Now, you can see that.
So we use that thing as a heuristic.
When I say I run or Milkha Singh ran, what does that mean?
So it's not the question who can, everybody.
we are now into twenty ninth module of AI .
You can move that piece forward.
In the initial chess movement, for example, youre youre moving across, you won't look at all moves okay .
Is a is a separate discipline today.
ACO is applied at many places including solving a vehicle routing problem, assignment problem, set problems, image processing where you need to process in highly parallel fashion.
Remember, we discussed about forward and backward planning, when we are using forward planning, we we use progression to move towards goal state and in backward planning we use this thing the regression okay .
Because if I if I if I just say, for example, A, B, C, D, I cut.
It just have some set of constraints.
The manoeuvering process itself is called search.
What we want is to have the problem in the final state once we completely solve that problem.
Okay One very simple way of doing it.
okay So, with this almost have completed MiniMax algorithm.
When we study heuristics, we’ll study it further but here let me tell you why it is not so.
So, it cannot even solve that problem.
You can use that thing as an algorithm or heuristic.
So it will happen a few times.
How many times you were wrong?
How they use a pheromone here?
And we have seen in fact, we have hinted that one can use heuristic to determine which move is better than the other , which we are going to address in the next module.
We have seen that how CD different rules of CD can can be used to represent statements.
For example, if you have seven that is seven minus one factorial, six factorial, okay that is seven twenty.
So out of that you choose the best okay maximum pheromone value and go ahead and go ahead means you pick up the next segment and the next stegment okay .
Most of of the cases what we do is we provide a cap, say that when it reaches ninety percent, nine point nine , we accept that thing or minus point one then you accept that thing as well.
And the other one is eight five three gallon milk jug problem.
One more way is to like for example let us take the same missionary cannibal case.
So, in the next rollout, they they they make all these changes and next version they change.
Every input unit or neuron is connected to every middle unit, okay .
Just look at the hidden unit which it it just look at 3 hidden units.
You can look at this example.
For example, chess, you have a a branching factor of around thirty five.
So you get the farmer on the left hand side again.
The ‘reason’ is terrorists attacked Mumbai.
So there is no point exploring J.
So, they share this information.
In some case, it it it goes beyond million.
So, that's what this MOP does and there is something called PAM which is based on planning.
So, that is represented here that this conceptualization, which is which is vertical, ‘Sachin PTRANS Sachin to plane.
How do we do that?
Eventually out of million possible cases it just sorts out small range of small set of those chemical compounds in which geologists can actually work on.
okay And that's very important.
If if you have if you have seen exactly what I’ve done in the previous case depth bound, you explore the tree and then the next cycle, you explore that tree again and then the next level sounds wasteful.
But that's not that simple, we’ll see how how how to proceed using that.
So, you can see that in a relation called POSS-BY or possessed by Sachin’s elbow.
‘Manoj had a chocolate.
I was talking about if you if you use some heuristic to find the shorter paths before.
Now, what is the state space?
I am not going to discuss that thing right now.
If you get a solution, that solution is optimum, not only that the advantage you don’t need to have the amount of memory that you’ll have that you’ll require in BFS.
So, either one or two person can carry that boat.
It is pretty simple.
What we want is obviously A to be on table.
Eventually it will reach to us and we'll looking at which will decide which out of which four children that we have which one is better for us.
So that’s a very good example of how one can use generate and test.
How have you done it?
Okay Now what you do is basically you store this T value in three column table.
Okay so what does that mean?
How they are merged is based on a method called crossover.
And it is also called tolerance level.
Solution search can be done in either way.
How you can solve a travelling salesman problem using the ant colony optimization?
So when you default is obviously a few, but whenever you encounter other information, you may add others Okay .
If it's not a leaf node what should it be doing?
But but the scripts are basically like this very example but it's still a very good example for you to understand different stakeholders of this thing, Okay .
Milkha Singh ran fast.
They are not inputs.
That is sigmoid function, which you can see drawn on the second slide, okay .
In fact, you can easily see that the other requirement is available, which will be moving actually.It is a cycle.
So, Unguided Search Methods are not all that useless kind of , they are quite useful, so we are going to discuss that.
One expert gives ten percent weightage to a component, some other will give twenty percent of this thing .
So there are many factors.
To write that we have used complex notations which are pretty hard to write.
The security person asked him to stand in a queue. There was heavy rush on the ticket counter and the queues are very, very long.
If I have five nodes and for example if you combine one and five and generate a new solution or new two new solutions basically think of it,
So, that can be easily assumed Okay .
Incrementing that by one and converting Player into the other player and also negating the values.
So, that is very, very critical part of this thing.
Now the first statement, first line which says L one two four eight and R zero zero zero zero, what does it mean?
So, transition finished and TS transition starting, commencement and conclusion, both are possible.
Now there are some pheromone values available.
They are added on the right hand side.
That is little confusing, but sometimes it is possible.
But technical functionality, testing, quality assurance is also a very, very important critical part of every system.
We have looked at some of the prerequisites, we have looked at labeling as W L and draw.
Chess is again a very, very hard problem because it contains so many moves.
The users are denying, users are denied of their services.
So, when you're throwing or or when you're kicking something or or doing something where you you apply physical force, you're talking about propel.
But then there is one more important issue.
It will actually for example, it'll generate hundred possible moves and out of that it explores only first twenty.
How we do that is explained here.
So, there is no so you've deleted something which is not part of the goal state so second condition is also satisfied.
In in case of progression, a a relevant progression is where it removes something which exist in start state but not in the goal state and it adds something which is not there in the start state but there in the goal state.
So what you’re doing?
So, the first one is 3,5,0.
Now, such a move is not very good.
But when I'm talking about bank in the context of a picnic, it’s basically a riverbank.
okay clears nose And similarly, M two is greater or equal to C two and M two equal to zero okay otherwise.
If we’re only picking up unexplored nodes what’s the point in storing explored nodes?
So, that is again an example.
So it begins with NULL but when it goes up, it adds to, it add that thing .
And what is being expelled?
Let us first of all, talk about those prerequisites.
We’ll look at how it happens in this particular module.
So, when I'm reading basically, it MTRANSING information from that newspaper to CP and once CP reads it, it might use short term memory for processing it and then transfer that thing into long term memory.
Depth first iterative deepening works like that.
So, that is susbtracted and then union is with free C and free D.
You can see that we we have some, we have to have some qualities to survive and those who have better qualities have better chances of survival
So I travel along one path and I get the distance from A to Z using that path is say thirty-five.
The problem itself moving from one state, for example, moving from Ahmedabad to to Vadodra how how you do that.
And that's why, it is possible to build programs which can play chess.
And it's good.
So if you're going down, down, down, and you it is quite possible that you allow a bad move and move to a little worse state but you still have remembered the good state, so you can always go back to that state.
So, people started thinking that neural networks cannot solve this problem.
Now we assume that this is an end, we’ll not go further.
Now this thing which we have looked at is very, very important.
So what we do is we begin with random set of weights and somehow make sure that these weights are changed over a period of time and converged into the set which gives us the right combination, right answer for every input that we provide.
So, nothing then it is present tense.
The first layer, connects to every unit of the second layer, the unit or neuron or number of neurons.
Second one is 5,0,3 Okay .
cough So these are examples of entry conditions.
The candidates for that thing so, they’re best actually and so we’re we’re always looking at best nodes.
These are the only three things the ants are doing, and they can share the information and this is the simplest way of sharing this information.
So, this is one thing which is indicated by rule number six.
One typical solution of farmer, fox, chicken, grain problem is shown.
There's going to be a database coder, who is going to design database for it.
Empty i,j minus two.
How do you do?
When you approach positive infinity, it approaches one.
That’s the first step.
Okay , so that essence is not captured by the language, it's not the limitation of CD , the CD is actually derived from that language.
Unlike the conventional system, this is a major difference here.
Because when number of missionaries become zero, you can have number of cannibals as two or three, no problem because they're not going to eat that missionary.
It is not searching through the search spaces,
In real world as I said, were sent out to survive on their own, those who survive only will meet with the others and get better offspring.
For example, if you encounter a statement like Jay asked for Italian pizza with double cheese, he waited for fifteen minutes, got angry and went away.
You can see on the next slide, now it is little, the PowerPoint animation is running, so better better try to see how it works.
We’ll look at the first method and that method is again pretty simple.
So we stop.
In database design, probably if you've gone through a database paper, you know that there is a problem called knowledge redundancy.
One more is called ATTEND, now when you focus your sense, sensing organ to to something for example when I'm reading, I'm focusing my eyes on newspaper or when I'm listening I'm I’m focusing my ear on the other party's words and whatever so, the in all these cases.
okay ,
We’ll never get two values which are equal.
Same as hill climbing, nothing different.
Okay So, that is a very typical problem that I've taken.
Our our movement actually places A on the table.
Winding part that you’ve written does not happen first here, happens in the last function, last function which is involved, that unwinding part happens there, then the next to next, then the next to next and so on and at the end you'll come to the first function which is being called.
You choose if there is a dead end you can always try the other path.
That is exactly what happens in in in some cases artificial worlds are created where the solutions are sent and then will pick up those who survive and so so on.
That’s the first thing.
So you you know, the direction from Mumbai to Los Angeles and so on so forth.
okay , A is already there so we have a cycle.
Okay , so technically there is no difference.
You probably read this or look at the PowerPoint slide to read more about and understand, because I've given a lot of examples of intrusion detection system and other systems in in my discussion, which I couldn't do it here, because because of the time constraint.
So, it is not Fr not fx not chicken not grain what does that mean?
It is one kind of, is is one type of engineering, one engineering discipline actually.
But the the second one we’ll have a chance to win, okay if the opponent makes mistake.
What if there is a function called H dash which which just negates that value? What you get is a lower value.
Nothing is flawless in this world and CD is not no exception.
So that that sometimes it chooses a non-optimal path as well and that helped it come out of that local minima or maxima issue, like the simulated annealing okay .
Similarly, number of cannibals which are C, substracted from the left hand side and added on the right hand side.
Let us begin with the description of progression.
The because he's an opponent and you can see that there are some winning already okay .
But okay , but the case number one is A is good B is not very good C is comparatively better than B because B when we are playing B we don't have any like one part is already full.
So, two raised to five you can have total thirty two combinations which can which is good for for example, all zeros will be one, all zeros but the last one is B and all zero but the fourth one is C and so on, so forth.
There are some ways of doing it and we will see how GA is applied. okay .Let us see.
okay The other example
But anyway, we are we are not discussing that part right now.
There is no central authority, unlike computer processors.
It just sums up things.
deep breath We have used variables like X, Y and Z .
There are sometimes other functions used, we’ll be looking at few other functions in due course.
We have seen to it's hard to write preconditions.
Opponent would like to go further because draw is not all that important for it it’ll go further and try to get L.
Those scripts and it is quite possible that two different scripts contain many things in common and they are not represented exactly the same way and so on so forth.
What they tried to do is they tried to learn the neurons, how the neurons of brains have functioning and tried to mimic the very neuron in in the computer domain that is called artificial neuron.
And you you do that further probing how experts decide and what are the past record indicates.
It says that Ravan is dead because the reason for that is Ram Ram has done something to him okay or poisoned him. Whatever.
So, that's what we are learning right now.
So I I don't need to worry about that rule, okay .
That’s why this is called unsupervised learning which is also quite quite important, and many a times this unsupervised learning is as a as a process pre-process for the supervised learning.
In fact, in some cases the mapping is is you will have to cycle that mapping in fact if you map the first element is already occurred then you you have to again map, so it is sometimes in some cases it is pretty complex but we have we taken a very, very simple case here to just make you understand how partially mapped crossover works.
set of rules again in this case, we could write with them in many other cases, we'll be talking about them for...for .
The heuristic function exactly tells you the value, Okay .
Okay . But in that, it believe me in fact, that’s what we are going to see that some typical types of moves are better than others, but we do not know that thing right now, and that’s why we'll we are using Unguided Search.
The the amount of we have already travelled okay so that we have value which is known and that that is not an estimate of anything.
Now, this is again an example of fuzzy logic like representation.
The third one is minus three and fourth one is minus two.
Eventually, from this previous state you will go to this goal state so our actual working is on this direction.
We don't really know.
They have to be three.
Now that that love can appear in many ways.
What is to be added?
So, there are alternate paths also and there are alternate execution of the sequences of these scenes also and so on so forth.
Virtual infinity is obviously not infinity but then real time you’ll not be able to handle that, so that’s also it's called virtual infinity.
But then a diligent reader would ask a question; how do the system learn that Epicurean is a restaurant?
How many times when you say that if I take a packet for deep inspection and I'm right that this packet is really malicious and this deep inspection reveals it.

Approaches include statistical methods, computational intelligence, and traditional symbolic AI.
A quip in Tesler's Theorem says AI is whatever hasn't been done yet.
A real-world example is that, unlike humans, current image classifiers don't determine the spatial relationship between components of the picture; instead, they learn abstract patterns of pixels that humans are oblivious to, but that linearly correlate with images of certain types of real objects.
Around 2016, China greatly accelerated its government funding; given its large supply of data and its rapidly increasing research output, some observers believe it may be on track to becoming an AI superpower.
Artificial intelligence
Artificial intelligence (AI), is intelligence demonstrated by machines, unlike the natural intelligence displayed by humans and animals.
Artificial intelligence (AI) is the area of computer science which is sometimes described as machine intelligence.
Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1955, and in the years since has experienced several waves of optimism, followed by disappointment and the loss of funding (known as an AI winter), followed by new approaches, success and renewed funding.
As a newbie to chatbots, I had to Google every fifth word to translate the developer talk into something more normal in order to get the gist of it.
A second, more general, approach is Bayesian inference: If the current patient has a fever, adjust the probability they have influenza in such-and-such way.
A simple example of an algorithm is the following (optimal for first player) recipe for play at tic-tac-toe:
As is well known, shared information is the best kind of information, but in a multinational company, the documentation would first need to be translated into several languages.
As machines become increasingly capable, tasks considered to require intelligence are often removed from the definition of AI, a phenomenon known as the AI effect.
As mentioned in the paper, it runs near real-time at 13FPS on 720p images with high text detection accuracy.
As per wikipedia-
A TensorFlow implementation of it is available as a part of the Tensor2Tensor package.
A toy example is that an image classifier trained only on pictures of brown horses and black cats might conclude that all brown patches are likely to be horses.
At present, machine translation can well be used, for instance, for non-public, company-internal communication and information sharing, especially when the content of the text needs to be transmitted quickly but the text is not distributed to a large audience.
A translation of the text can be obtained quickly and in a form that enables the recipients to understand the core content of the message.
Attendees Allen Newell (CMU), Herbert Simon (CMU), John McCarthy (MIT), Marvin Minsky (MIT) and Arthur Samuel (IBM) became the founders and leaders of AI research.
Attention is a concept that helped improve the performance of neural machine translation applications.
At the same time, Japan's fifth generation computer project inspired the U.S and British governments to restore funding for academic research.
Attributes
Attributes can be described as packages including information (e.g., name, email, phone number) a chatbot collects while chatting with a user.
Attributes help a chatbot personalize its responses.
A typical AI analyzes its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of success.
A written review provides valuable information both to the company and customers visiting the company's website.
Because of that, your chatbot can provide answers relevant to user input.

Colloquially, the term artificial intelligence is often used to describe machines (or computers) that mimic cognitive functions that humans associate with the human mind, such as learning and problem solving.
Companies have a broad and diverse range of translation needs.
Companies operating in different industries can accumulate considerable amounts of documentation on products, services and operating models.
Compared with humans, existing AI lacks several features of human commonsense reasoning; most notably, humans have powerful mechanisms for reasoning about naïve physics such as space, time, and physical interactions.

Documentation and instructions
Does your company have a lot of internal documentation that needs to be translated into other languages? 
Do you know the feeling of reading something but having no clue what the author is talking about? That’s what I felt when I read an article about chatbot technology for the first time.
Do you want to make the company’s internal, international communication easier? 
EAST can detect text both in images and in the video.
Entities
Entities are keywords and phrases that are similar in meaning and that are crucial for your chatbot conversations.
Even if English was chosen as the company’s official language, not everyone may be able to use it, at least well enough.
Even though machine translation solutions are developing all the time, it must be kept in mind that the translations they produce are not completely free of errors.
Faintly superimposing such a pattern on a legitimate image results in an adversarial image that the system misclassifies.
Fallback
Faster computers, algorithmic improvements, and access to large amounts of data enabled advances in machine learning and perception; data-hungry deep learning methods started to dominate accuracy benchmarks around 2012.
Filters
Filters help your chatbot decide which response should be sent to users based on the context and the information the user provides.
Filters let you also show specific info to people who come to your website using a specific URL address.
First, the network proposes the region which would possibly have the test and then classify the region if it has the text or not.
Flat white
For example, it can recommend an exact product that interests a customer.
For example, the names of products and services you offer.
For example, to your CRM or email marketing software and the other way around.
For example, when Facebook made its API public in 2016, chatbot makers were able to finally integrate their third-party solutions with Messenger.
For example, when viewing a map and looking for the shortest driving route from Denver to New York in the East, one can in most cases skip looking at any path through San Francisco or other areas far to the West; thus, an AI wielding a pathfinding algorithm like A* can avoid the combinatorial explosion that would ensue if every possible route had to be ponderously considered.
For example, with Messenger integration, you can connect ChatBot with Messenger or Slack with no coding.
For instance, optical character recognition is frequently excluded from things considered to be AI, having become a routine technology.
For instance, the translation of the word ‘volume’ may refer to sound volume, a quantity of space or an amount, regardless of the actual context.
For instance, your chatbot can ask a user if they are looking for a flat to buy or rent, and then display an offer relevant to their response.
For less important products, the quality of machine translation may well be sufficient, for instance, if the product description only includes a couple of sentences.
For most of its history, AI research has been divided into sub-fields that often fail to communicate with each other.
For some texts, translation quality is the highest priority.
For the latter two cases, there is a solution that makes everyday information sharing and communication easier, even when there is a very large amount of text.
For the translation of user manuals, marketing materials and other public documents, a human translator is still recommended.
For urgent situations, an immediate translation can be ordered through the portal.
From them, customers may get information crucial to their purchase decision that cannot be found elsewhere.
Further development in tesseract has been sponsored by Google since 2006.
General intelligence is among the field's long-term goals.
Goals can be explicitly defined or induced.

Harvard’s NLP group created a guide annotating the paper with PyTorch implementation.
He attributes this to an increase in affordable neural networks, due to a rise in cloud computing infrastructure and to an increase in research tools and datasets.
Here, machine translation helps customers with their purchase decisions.
Here we begin to see one key property of the Transformer, which is that the word in each position flows through its own path in the encoder. 
However, a reader with basic language skills can understand what the intended meaning of the text is.
However, beginning with the collapse of the Lisp Machine market in 1987, AI once again fell into disrepute, and a second, longer-lasting hiatus began.
However, it has been acknowledged that reports regarding artificial intelligence have tended to be exaggerated.
However, machine translation is not a solution for all translation needs.
However, the shorter schedule requires that the original machine translation output is of sufficiently good quality.
However, this is a computationally expensive task.
However, this is nearly impossible when the company has sites all over the world.
Humans also have a powerful mechanism of folk psychology that helps them to interpret natural-language sentences such as The city councilmen refused the demonstrators a permit because they advocated violence .
If a company is operating in several countries or on several continents even, communication becomes more difficult to manage.
If necessary, post-editing can be ordered for selected important texts, so that a human translator edits the machine translation into a more refined form.
If the AI is programmed for reinforcement learning, goals can be implicitly induced by rewarding some types of behavior or punishing others.
If the documentation to be translated needs to be easy to understand and, especially, if the documentation is critical in terms of safety, the appropriate solution is post-edited machine translation or traditional translation by a professional translator.
If you feel the same while reading about chatbots, or talking about them with others, have a look at my list of essential chatbot terms.
I missed what you said.
In 2005, it was open-sourced by HP.
In 2006, Tesseract was considered one of the most accurate open-source OCR engines then available.

In addition, the end result of post-editing can be used to train the machine translation engine to further improve its operation.
In a machine translation application, it would take a sentence in one language, and output its translation in another.
In ChatBot, a Story is a scenario of a conversation that your chatbot has with users.
Information is most useful when it is shared within the whole organization.
In machine translation, texts are translated automatically with computer software so that a human translator does not directly participate in the process.
In March 2016, AlphaGo won 4 out of 5 games of Go in a match with Go champion Lee Sedol, becoming the first computer Go-playing system to beat a professional Go player without handicaps.
In practice, it is seldom possible to consider every possibility, because of the phenomenon of combinatorial explosion, where the time needed to solve a problem grows exponentially.
In practice, the material to be translated is transmitted in an encrypted form between the client and the machine translation system.
In such a case, padding the bounding box could help.
In such a situation, the recipient can quickly and easily translate the original message into their own language, or the sender can take care of that.

In the following, we will go through some scenarios where machine translation can help with a company’s daily operations.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, AI began to be used for logistics, data mining, medical diagnosis and other areas.
In the lexicon-based approach, the highest probable label sequence will be predicted.
In the previous post, we looked at Attention – a ubiquitous method in modern deep learning models.
In these cases, it is a good idea to classify products into more and less important ones, so that human quality assurance can be added for the translations of the most important products, if necessary.
In the translation process with post-editing, the source material is first translated into the target language with machine translation, and a human editor then reviews and corrects the translation.
In the twenty-first century, AI techniques have experienced a resurgence following concurrent advances in computer power, large amounts of data, and theoretical understanding; and AI techniques have become an essential part of the technology industry, helping to solve many challenging problems in computer science, software engineering and operations research.
In this blog post, we will explain which text types are best suited for machine translation.
In this post, we will attempt to oversimplify things a bit and introduce the concepts one by one to hopefully make it easier to understand to people without in-depth knowledge of the subject matter.
In this post, we will look at The Transformer – a model that uses attention to boost the speed with which these models can be trained.
In this technique, a sliding window passes through the image to detect the text in that window, like a convolutional neural network.
It allows chatbots to perform tasks that would normally require human intelligence, like decision making, language translation, or speech recognition.
It can be triggered when the user’s problem goes beyond the chatbot’s scope.
It can be used in combination with any text recognition method.
It can find horizontal and rotated bounding boxes.
It could be a website, LiveChat, Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, Slack, Kik, etc.
It is also a great benefit that machine translation can be used to easily translate texts that would otherwise not be translated at all, such as email messages.
It is also important that all parties are aware of the use of machine translation.
It is in fact Google Cloud’s recommendation to use The Transformer as a reference model to use their Cloud TPU offering.
It is worth mentioning as it is only a text detection method.
It lets chatbots understand the context and meaning of a user’s message and react to it properly, even if the user makes a spelling mistake.
It lets you create a more natural flow of conversation.
It’s a default interaction that is triggered when the bot doesn’t recognize the user’s input.
It’s a feature that allows you to make a copy of an existing chatbot scenario.
It’s a toolset that lets apps communicate with other services and enables developers to integrate new apps into existing software.
It seems due to image clarity, tesseract could not recognize it perfectly.
It seems that stylized font with shadow in the background has affected the result in the above case.

Leading AI textbooks define the field as the study of intelligent agents: any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of successfully achieving its goals.
Learners also work on the basis of Occam's razor: The simplest theory that explains the data is the likeliest.
Learning algorithms work on the basis that strategies, algorithms, and inferences that worked well in the past are likely to continue working well in the future.
Let’s begin by looking at the model as a single black box.
Let’s first look at how to calculate self-attention using vectors, then proceed to look at how it’s actually implemented – using matrices.
Let's see text detection and recognition in action in the following code.
Machine learning
Machine learning (ML) is a branch of AI that allows chatbots to identify patterns in human language and learn from past conversations.
Machine translation can also be used to translate PowerPoint presentations, intranet bulletins, and other similar documents.

Machine translation is an excellent choice in situations where having the materials translated by a human translator would be too large an investment.
Machine translation is not fully replacing human translators, but it can help humans with texts that would otherwise probably not be translated at all.
Machine translation systems integrated into an online store are often used in the travel industry’s online services and the online trade of consumer products.
Many AI algorithms are capable of learning from data; they can enhance themselves by learning new heuristics (strategies, or rules of thumb, that have worked well in the past), or can themselves write other algorithms.
Many people would in fact prefer communication in their native language, which would decrease ambiguity.
Many systems attempt to reduce overfitting by rewarding a theory in accordance with how well it fits the data, but penalizing the theory in accordance with how complex the theory is.
Many tools are used in AI, including versions of search and mathematical optimization, artificial neural networks, and methods based on statistics, probability and economics.
Marvin Minsky agreed, writing, within a generation ... the problem of creating 'artificial intelligence' will substantially be solved.
May be slight rotation would help.
Modern machine capabilities generally classified as AI include successfully understanding human speech, competing at the highest level in strategic game systems (such as chess and Go), autonomously operating cars, intelligent routing in content delivery networks, and military simulations.
Much of AI research involves figuring out how to identify and avoid considering a broad range of possibilities unlikely to be beneficial.
Natural language processing
Natural language processing (NLP) is a branch of AI that helps computers read, understand, and make sense of the human language.
Next, we’ll switch up the example to a shorter sentence and we’ll look at what happens in each sub-layer of the encoder.
Notice that these new vectors are smaller in dimension than the embedding vector. 
Numeric 1 could not be detected at all.
Often, all relevant information is recorded for future reference, either for development actions or just for maintenance.
Often, the party offering a free translation service withholds the right to use the translated material.
Once we have detected the bounding boxes having the text, the next step is to recognize text.
One benefit of Acolad’s machine translation service is that a file can be attached to the machine translation order; there is no need to cut and paste the text.
One of the benefits of this process is the delivery time – it is often shorter than with translation performed by a human translation from start to finish.
One utilizes the fully convolutional network to directly produce word or text-line level prediction.
Only a human can interpret, for instance, the multi-level meanings of a journalistic or literary text.
Other cited examples include Microsoft's development of a Skype system that can automatically translate from one language to another and Facebook's system that can describe images to blind people.
Others believe that AI, unlike previous technological revolutions, will create a risk of mass unemployment.

Product reviews can be easily translated into another language.
Progress slowed and in 1974, in response to the criticism of Sir James Lighthill and ongoing pressure from the US Congress to fund more productive projects, both the U.S. and British governments cut off exploratory research in AI.
Quick replies are short chatbot messages that suggest users possible options.
Quick reply
Region-based approach work in two steps.
Remove the complex background from the image
Remove the noise from the image
Say we’re calculating the self-attention for the first word in this example, “Thinking”. 
Sentiment analysis
Sentiment analysis can help a chatbot analyze user messages and identify whether the person’s attitude towards certain products or services is negative, positive, or neutral.
Sentiment analysis is a subfield of computer science that uses NLP and machine learning to measure the sentiment and tone of text or spoken language.
Settling on a bad, overly complex theory gerrymandered to fit all the past training data is known as overfitting.
So for each word, we create a Query vector, a Key vector, and a Value vector. 
Software integration
Software integration is the process of two or more applications being connected.
So let’s try to break the model apart and look at how it functions.
Some AI systems, such as nearest-neighbor, instead of reason by analogy, these systems are not generally given goals, except to the degree that goals are implicit in their training data.
Some of the learners described below, including Bayesian networks, decision trees, and nearest-neighbor, could theoretically, (given infinite data, time, and memory) learn to approximate any function, including which combination of mathematical functions would best describe the world.
Some people also consider AI to be a danger to humanity if it progresses unabated.
Some systems implicitly or explicitly use multiple of these approaches, alongside many other AI and non-AI algorithms; the best approach is often different depending on the problem.
So one cannot assume at this point that the output of a machine translation engine is always good.
Standard objection detection techniques will also work here.
Still, we have achieved good results with the EAST model and Tesseract.
Story
Sub-fields have also been based on social factors (particular institutions or the work of particular researchers).
Such systematic errors can easily be fixed by training the translation engine further.
Such systems can still be benchmarked if the non-goal system is framed as a system whose goal is to successfully accomplish its narrow classification task.
Tesseract 4 added deep-learning based capability with LSTM network(a kind of Recurrent Neural Network) based OCR engine which is focused on the line recognition but also supports the legacy Tesseract OCR engine of Tesseract 3 which works by recognizing character patterns.
Tesseract was originally developed at Hewlett-Packard Laboratories between 1985 and 1994.
Text detection techniques required to detect the text in the image and create and bounding box around the portion of the image having text.
Texts with a short life cycle
Thanks to machine learning, properly programmed AI chatbots can improve over time without the help of a human.
The AI field draws upon computer science, information engineering, mathematics, psychology, linguistics, philosophy, and many other fields.
The article here proved to be a helpful resource in writing the code for this project.
The biggest benefit, however, comes from how The Transformer lends itself to parallelization.
The bounding box can be created around the text through the sliding window technique.
The bulletins and advertisements of a local competitor can be translated, as well as the content of local patents.
The capability of the Tesseract was mostly limited to structured text data.
The convolution neural network extracts features from the input image(text detected region).
The decoder has both those layers, but between them is an attention layer that helps the decoder focus on relevant parts of the input sentence (similar what attention does in seq2seq models).
The deep bidirectional recurrent neural network predicts label sequence with some relation between the characters.
The development of metal–oxide–semiconductor (MOS) very-large-scale integration (VLSI), in the form of complementary MOS (CMOS) transistor technology, enabled the development of practical artificial neural network (ANN) technology in the 1980s.
The earliest (and easiest to understand) approach to AI was symbolism (such as formal logic): If an otherwise healthy adult has a fever, then they may have influenza.
The encoder’s inputs first flow through a self-attention layer – a layer that helps the encoder look at other words in the input sentence as it encodes a specific word. 
The exact same feed-forward network is independently applied to each position.
The feed-forward layer does not have those dependencies, however, and thus the various paths can be executed in parallel while flowing through the feed-forward layer.
The field of AI research was born at a workshop at Dartmouth College in 1956, where the term Artificial Intelligence was coined by John McCarthy to distinguish the field from cybernetics and escape the influence of the cyberneticist Norbert Wiener.
The field was founded on the assumption that human intelligence can be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it.
The first step in calculating self-attention is to create three vectors from each of the encoder’s input vectors (in this case, the embedding of each word). 
The first work that is now generally recognized as AI was McCullouch and Pitts' 1943 formal design for Turing-complete artificial neurons.
The goal is to share information within the entire organization so that as many employees as possible have access to the best information that supports for their work.
The idea in post-edited machine translation is that a human corrects any obvious errors made by a machine.
Their dimensionality is 64, while the embedding and encoder input/output vectors have dimensionality of 512. 
The Kinect, which provides a 3D body–motion interface for the Xbox 360 and the Xbox One, uses algorithms that emerged from lengthy AI research as do intelligent personal assistants in smartphones.
The language of the translation is not necessarily error-free or fully logical, but it can be understood.
The language skills of employees can vary a lot.
The latest stable version 4.1.0 is released on July 7, 2019.
The model performed pretty decently here.
The model performed pretty well here.
The Nanonets OCR API allows you to build OCR models with ease.
The need to translate them is often urgent.
The network architecture has been taken from this paper published in 2015.
The next few years would later be called an AI winter, a period when obtaining funding for AI projects was difficult.
Then there are texts for which quick delivery is the most important thing.
The outputs of the self-attention layer are fed to a feed-forward neural network. 
The produced predictions which could be rotated rectangles or quadrangles are further processed through the non-maximum-suppression step to yield the final output.
There are dependencies between these paths in the self-attention layer. 
There are several techniques for recognizing the text.
There are single-shot detection techniques like YOLO(you only look once) and region-based text detection techniques for text detection in the image.
There are two modes of transcription, namely the lexicon-free and lexicon-based transcription.
Therefore, according to Occam's razor principle, a learner must be designed such that it prefers simpler theories to complex theories, except in cases where the complex theory is proven substantially better.
There is a convolutional implementation of the sliding window which can reduce the computational time.
There is a non-uniform background here, maybe generating a uniform background would have helped this case.
There is no need for the produced content to be available in only one language when the material can be effortlessly translated into other languages.
The relationship between human translators and machine translation systems has been that the machine translation engine has been trained with translations created by human translators.
There may also be large quantities of various instructions, but translating them is not considered a viable option due to the cost.
The resulting cost is often considered too high.
The reviews are typically translated into the language of the customer's web browser.
The score determines how much focus to place on other parts of the input sentence as we encode a word at a certain position.
These are the standard ways to preprocess image in a computer vision task.
These characters and their fates raised many of the same issues now discussed in the ethics of artificial intelligence.
The second step in calculating self-attention is to calculate a score. 
These four main approaches can overlap with each other and with evolutionary systems; for example, neural nets can learn to make inferences, to generalize, and to make analogies.
These inferences can be obvious, such as since the sun rose every morning for the last 10,000 days, it will probably rise tomorrow morning as well.
These issues have been explored by myth, fiction and philosophy since antiquity.
These sub-fields are based on technical considerations, such as particular goals (e.g. robotics or machine learning), the use of particular tools (logic or artificial neural networks), or deep philosophical differences.
These vectors are created by multiplying the embedding by three matrices that we trained during the training process.
The strength of human translators is still the quality of the translation.
The study of mathematical logic led directly to Alan Turing's theory of computation, which suggested that a machine, by shuffling symbols as simple as 0 and 1, could simulate any conceivable act of mathematical deduction.
The study of mechanical or formal reasoning began with philosophers and mathematicians in antiquity.
The success was due to increasing computational power (see Moore's law and transistor count), greater emphasis on solving specific problems, new ties between AI and other fields (such as statistics, economics and mathematics), and a commitment by researchers to mathematical methods and scientific standards.
The text detection pipeline in this paper has excluded redundant and intermediate steps and only has two stages.
The third factor is price: there may be massive amounts of documentation stored in archives that remain untranslated simply because of the cost.
The third major approach, extremely popular in routine business AI applications, are analogizers such as SVM and nearest-neighbor: After examining the records of known past patients whose temperature, symptoms, age, and other factors mostly match the current patient, X% of those patients turned out to have influenza.
The traditional problems (or goals) of AI research include reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception and the ability to move and manipulate objects.
The transcription layer converts the per-frame made by RNN into a label sequence.
The Transformers outperforms the Google Neural Machine Translation model in specific tasks.
The Transformer was proposed in the paper Attention is All You Need.
The translated material only remains in the memory of the machine translation engine for a short time, and it is not used for any other purposes.
The translation quality produced by machine translation is not sufficient as such in many situations.
The typing delay is a scrollbar that enables you to set up how fast your chatbot should respond to user input.
The undisputed strength of machine translation is the speed of the translation process.
The word order may be odd, or a single word may have been replaced with a strange synonym.
They and their students produced programs that the press described as astonishing: computers were learning checkers strategies (c. 1954) (and by 1959 were reportedly playing better than the average human), solving word problems in algebra, proving logical theorems (Logic Theorist, first run c. 1956) and speaking English.
They can be nuanced, such as X% of families have geographically separate species with color variants, so there is a Y% chance that undiscovered black swans exist.
They don’t HAVE to be smaller, this is an architecture choice to make the computation of multiheaded attention (mostly) constant.
They failed to recognize the difficulty of some of the remaining tasks.
They help users make their decision faster and improve the flow of the conversation.
They retrieve information from chatbot conversations, like email addresses or telephone numbers, and pass them automatically to web services.
This comes in handy if you want to personalize your chatbot communication.
This enables even young children to easily make inferences like If I roll this pen off a table, it will fall on the floor.
This insight, that digital computers can simulate any process of formal reasoning, is known as the Church–Turing thesis.
This is a very robust deep learning method for text detection based on this paper.
This marked the completion of a significant milestone in the development of Artificial Intelligence as Go is a relatively complex game, more so than Chess.
This model does not need character segmentation.
This neural network architecture integrates feature extraction, sequence modeling, and transcription into a unified framework.
This option is for situations where a translation is needed as soon as possible.
This raises philosophical arguments about the mind and the ethics of creating artificial beings endowed with human-like intelligence.
This version is significantly more accurate on the unstructured text as well.
This way, even texts containing business secrets can be translated using machine translation.
This way, information can be distributed to a considerably wider target audience within the company.
Thought-capable artificial beings appeared as storytelling devices in antiquity, and have been common in fiction, as in Mary Shelley's Frankenstein or Karel Čapek's R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots).
To create a Story, you need to use conversational elements like bot responses, user input, attributes, entities, etc.
Today, machine translation works best in scenarios where a text needs to be conveyed in an understandable form in another language.
Today’s machine translation systems can help with companies’ internal and, in some cases, external communication – at least when the text they produce is reviewed before publication.
Transfer
Transfer is an action that redirects a chatbot user to a live chat agent.
Transfer to a human agent
Turing proposed changing the question from whether a machine was intelligent, to whether or not it is possible for machinery to show intelligent behaviour.
Typing delay
User: Anna.
User: I would like to order coffee.
Usually, the most important thing for the reader is to understand the essential content of the review; it does not matter if the machine translation engine occasionally makes some silly mistakes or formulates sentences in a clumsy way.
Webhooks
Webhooks, also called a web callback, are automated API responses.
We can not expect the OCR model to be 100 % accurate.
We’ll look closer at self-attention later in the post.
We need to score each word of the input sentence against this word. 
We try with different window size to not miss the text portion with different size.
We will be discussing some of the best techniques in the following section.
We will be seeing this EAST model in action along with text recognition.
We will not be focusing on preprocessing step in this blog.
We will use some of the images to show both text detection with the EAST method and text recognition with Tesseract 4.
What are the best uses for machine translation?
What does machine translation mean?
When an online store is operating in multiple countries, using machine translation for translating reviews can be an excellent way to serve customers.
When an understandable, useful and reviewed text is needed fast, the combination of machine translation and post-editing can be the right choice.
When better quality is needed
When, for instance, a disturbance in production can be announced quickly to a large group of people, the problem can also be responded to quickly and effectively.
When the best translation quality is called for, or the text type is difficult for a machine translation engine, the use of a human translator should be selected.
When the product catalog of an online store is extensive, machine translation is quite commonly used for translating product information.
With free, publicly available machine translation services, there is a risk that the translated text will remain in the translation engine’s memory.
YOLO is single-shot techniques as you pass the image only once to detect the text in that region, unlike the sliding window.
You can also find this code for this project on a Kaggle kernel to try it out on your own.
You can also use the Nanonets-OCR- API by following the steps below:
You can create your list of entities so that your chatbot can identify and retrieve them from user responses.
You can refer one of my previous article to understand techniques for object detection, in our case text detection.
You can see that bounding boxes are mostly correct as they should be.
You can upload your data, annotate it, set the model to train and wait for getting predictions through a browser based UI.
You get the machine translation almost immediately for your use.
