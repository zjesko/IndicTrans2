Because, as I said, you begin with random set of weights.
okay , The same thing can be shared in hundred odd ways or even more ways if you are a poet or somebody like that.
Now, this is called Depth-first search.
The summation should be less than zero but it is going above zero.
So, we don't need to bother much about the theory issue.
We have so far looked at the MiniMax algorithm itself where the structure node info, the recursive version of the algorithm, three different components of a recursive algorithm and how MiniMax actually does all this jobs, how MiniMax algorithm continuous recursively calls itself till it reaches the leaf node and applying static evolution function there and then backs the value up in the unwinding part and chooses the best move.
Here, we don't do that, okay though we say that.
At the maximizing layer, we have the same choice we’ll choose win, okay , so, because we are going to play.
Okay , the next search method that we’re going to we’re going to talk about is called best first search.
So, there may be more and this again we are talking about real systems, where there are more than one correct responses, which is quite possible we are we are dealing with real It is quite possible that one expert says that malaria, the other says typhoid and the patient actually has both of them.
But look at ‘slash’.
So you can see that when script is invoked, all of these are assumed .
If you have that domain knowledge here you can say which move is better than the other, is called heuristic.
People use a lot of other names for this and one very good domain which is called crowdsourcing is also doing something quite similar.
So, more numbers you provide, in most cases it is better.
It is impossible in in some cases but it is it is possible in some cases as well.
Precondition is that A has to be free, that is, nothing should be resting on A then and then you can put it on table otherwise you cannot.
Unlike that we can't pour milk out of the jug.
Suppose it finds the food source, it follows the same path to come back.
It is also possible that in fact, empirically it is it has solved many problems.
Remember, the calculation we requires everything every the sigma that we have seen X X one W one X two W two X three W three and so on.
Chess-playing programs usually have time associated so it says that you have five minutes, in five minutes you'll have to find out whatever you can.
What does that do?
For example, somebody speaking in Hindi and the the listener is French .
W one is layer one, W two is layer two, I and J.
So six is not allowed .
Okay .
He stabbed Ravan or shot Ravan or cut his head into two by sword.
Now let us see how the next method called Breadth-first search works.
okay , If it is feasible to have some machine learning, so, you just can take data from reputed sources like doctor’s logs and and the blog is written by somebody and genuine medical books and things like that and and just bring it to the database.
We’re also seeing it that it is possible to apply a little different type of a search called solution search where every node in this search space represents a solution.
Okay . Okay And I've already talked about sparse neighbourhood and dense neighbourhood and there is something called variable neighbourhood.
Or generate, from this solution state you generate other solution states and find out which one is better and then you move there,
You have multiple neighbours, multiple solutions possible.
So we would like to explore and try to figure out what how good a particular move is and go further we are more sure.
So, we have the last one is W one M one okay .
And reproduction process helps the genes to carry from parent to offspring, okay .
In fact, our solution you probably have seen that a few places we are just pouring the water out of the jug because water is inexpensive which is not there stated in the problem itself.
Those are all implicitly mentioned when we talk in in a normal way.
Why?
Progression is moving towards the goal state, regression is coming back from the goal state.
Now what we are doing?
And they realized that even experts make mistake.
One, the ability to hear and smell and the other ability is to run fast.
The critic, the person who is going to evaluate is is also an expert but then is not the same He is going to validate this model.
Okay . You probably think that it’s a bit wasteful.
So, that's the power of CD .
We just say that A B C D is not equal to six, twelve or four.
In this case, you can see that on on the slide, that we assumed output units to be six, the input units eighty-one.
Okay , scripts were great but then they were quite isolated.
Fr is farmer, fx is fox, ch is chicken and Gr is grain.
Quite interesting observation can be seen from what we are doing on the right hand side.
So you don't require to apply minimum, it's always maximum.
That solution space is now you know, we we can start travelling in search space using two methods.
Now, B becomes minus three though there is a a node which can guarantee a very good that thing , but opponent is not going to play that for us.
So that is represented as picture aiders in in CD .
You can see that in the initial movements, first four movements, we are not actually moving missionaries.
We almost always explore game trees partially because most cases it is impossible to do one.
So, that is one important thing that happens here.
Take a set of random sequences as nodes in the state space, the solution space.
Now you can see that there are two different conceptualization and there this shows a relationship between them.
So, if you do that you probably will start with one and then the other so placing D on the table.
So it is become so for our case there are total three sixty different tours possible between these seven cities.
And remember a true sense of direction can only come if you have a good heuristic okay , otherwise you won't have so that's the point here that I will like to make.
Like if I want to change this ‘attack’ to to primitives, I need to again make it more complicated which I do not want to do.
So what we’re doing is is is kind of a generate and test, we’ll just look at a sequence.
In fact, there are many ways of doing it.
I have already discussed that thing.
So, we we we begin from an initial state, we move across in the state space using moves that we have.
Moving upon one step further or two step further and you have eight points.
And the second principle of GA is that when better elements when better individuals meet they produce even better offspring.
So, what you do is you just pick up the first segment and this.
One is called LOC or location, which talks about where this thing happened.
What's the advantage?
So, there are three different conceptualizations acting together to represent a given statement, Okay .
That's the other option.
Suppose example there are ten moves and you reach to seventh move which is not acceptable, so seven eight nine ten four moves you can take all combinations of that and try.
A relevant state is where it moves towards the goal stack okay .
So, all users can have it and so on so forth, can be quite quite handy, quite useful.
So, how it is done that X is inserted on the stack, Y is inserted on the stack, Z is inserted on the stack and you solve Z first then Y f then and then X or you insert Z Y X and then solve it that way and so on so forth.
Okay , let's move on.
What does that mean?
If it is phi means that you have deleted something which is not part of the goal state then it is absolutely fine.
And here is an example, we start with a random side of parents say twenty and then find their fitness values and choose better five, generate thirty offspring, how you get, because there are fifteen distinct pairs of five offspring that which which which generate two children so you get thirty. Okay .
If you negate it, you always have to apply one function maximizing and you will get the same answer.
But otherwise, the later two search methods will eventually stop.
okay .
Okay , now you might be getting the feel for the problems AI researchers are facing over the years.
So that third arrow points to the object which is being moved from this location to that location.
What's the point in travelling along?
First, which are already explored.
Now, for example, eight zero zero that is converted to zero five three.
It is done using some practical implementation and comparing with the results and you use the best one which suits you, suits that problem actually.
So this is how I can apply heuristic function and get the move that I should choose rather than exploring all of them like breadth-first or exploring one branch and then the second branch and the third branch like DFS.
And the state generated , should not be generated again , that is what we mean by a cycle.
The first activation function that we look at is called Square, which we have already seen.
So, it is possible that you choose them you use something else to choose.
We must start with 4,8 and 9,2,7 and so and so forth.
Okay a very similar thing is not only time but a place. I saw a match in Nagpur.
Here, we have three missionaries and three cannibals on one side of a river.
You may be surprised re-running the program, how it solves?
And my pawn, if I place the pawn in the position that is shown that pawn’s position at that point of time is more than a queen's position because that will help me check the king and the game will be over.
There is a reason.
Okay , so those fleeting scripts is also an interesting problem.
Technically, it is pretty simple.
How GA works?
Remember, when we’re at the solution?
State space is about representing the problem in a computer understandable form.
Okay , let me tell you one more thing, this is my way of representing.
People at the forensic does something like this.
In the beginning they travel at the constant speed and they spray pheromone along the path.
They can't think of it.
So, if farmer is on one side, the other side, you can't have farm.
Now MTRANS is is quite important here for example, a verb called reading is what?
You did that because you could associate this information and search in associative way.
Again, the difference is to be removed; this is how it works.
When somebody tells us something like this and we don't know what Epicurean is we will ask what is it? Okay .
I’ve already told earlier that however simple this looks like the block’s world problem can be pretty useful for robots to work.
That’s the problem.
If I have to search the key in entire house, it is useless .
Now you can clearly see that path one is little shorter.
You cannot pour it out.
You don’t have complete information about the current status but you will soon be able to find your own way out, based on the old memories little part of something that you can remember.
And sixty-two if it is upper lower case as well as digits.
This is the best method because you were exploring everything in parallels.
This is the time where I've reached when the reached to the leaf node. I have reached to the leaf node, apply static evolution function okay and then that value is returned back.
So that that adds randomness to movement in the initial run in a way that you escape from local minima and it is proved to be quite useful.
Okay So, there is a unit one which learns to be active when the line one slanting line from going up from left to right okay .
So why it is not desirable?
So, that's the other addition.
And knowledge engineer that knowledge and expert also learns a lot out of it.
And this process is like black box.
There are two things to be done, what we want here A on the table and B on top of A.
So, once you do that, what you've done is you’ve identified components and given those values.
So, there is no point invoking that script, there's something wrong, okay .
Not all place you will find exactly the rules to be the same.
So, this is called degree of freedom, I don't have the the degree of freedom I should.
For example, when I worked with one of my student on intrusion detection system, both of us learn a lot of things out of it.
They are applied and what you get is the answer.
clears nose Okay so farmer cannot be on the both side.
The inputs are provided, outputs are generated and we correct those outputs by changing these weights.
Okay one after Jay being late, he asking a question and he's getting the response.
Then you can say that, at pawn black i,j minus two you just move pawn two steps further and where earlier the pawn was that place is blank.
So the project planning is done in a way that whenever the expert is available, you should execute things where you need him, okay .
So you have to choose that precondition accordingly.
In most cases, heuristic function will not give you exact value.
What what are the possible candidates and you'll just look at the them and check them which matches they they’ll just give you the Dendral, the output of the Dendral is small side of states which matches.
We need a rule of thumbs and that's precisely what we are going to discuss in the next module.
Support planning comes next.
okay , number of missionaries on either side is less than number of cannibals.
Who is playing it?
So that's that's the idea of branch and bound which is pretty simple.
And how can we state so?
Okay , there's one script which is a very simple script which I have provided in the handout of watching match.
Think of a moving car, an automated car, which is actually taking lot of inputs from a lot of sensors across, lot of cameras and all that, the data structure that you're going to use is pretty complex.
So, you can clearly state that is not relevant.
Then we will pick up the shortest city, the nearest city from that city and so on.
okay , so that is there is no panacea.
It's not found in other problem other problem solving methods that we have seen.
So, it is again varying .
It looks at the input and tries to figure out the the chemical compound structure.
The problems could be if you're using sparse neighbourhood we might be ignoring some important moves.
I have only two rules .
Not only that, the fox will have nothing to do with grain.
Hill climbing is simple.
So it will have higher heuristic value based on this information okay .
Total path between any two cities in a given graph is based on the number of cities that you have.
From B every other city than A and B and so on so forth.
So, that is important here and remember what I have told you the the leaf nodes you apply that static evaluation function okay and then it passed up, that happens in the unwinding part of the function.
Now what is this?
So, we are just planning.
You may be surprised the word average and and the value six point two, the value six point two clearly indicates what the value is while greater than average it's more like a fuzzy logic system and that's true.
And once a good designer has designed that script and that is used in representing a statement you can get immense value out of it.
That that's the point here.
And not much of a difference.
Second ‘Jay went to a friend's house near cricket stadium.
Implementation planning comes next.
But it is justified because we’re looking at an AI problem.
We have looked at two trivial problems in the previous module.
But important thing is while you come back you also have to think about prerequisites.
We will be looking at that algorithm in the next module.
Here the MOPs are a little more dynamic.
If the script writer has actually provided typical scenes, which can indicate, why one can get angry?
We’ll jump to ten and we got a solution, Okay .
If one of them is win, what will that person do?
Now this is an example of a fleeting script mentioned.
Now how that is changed?
When mental information is being transferred, MTRANS is used and we'll see some examples about how to how to use this form.
A farmer is on the left hand side he cannot be on the right hand side, okay , where A belongs to obviously farmer or not farmer B, belongs to fox not fox, and so on so forth.
With that, we’ll come to an end of this particular module.
How?
If you don’t have from this particular state there are no rules possible you can’t go further is a dead end.
So, that's why you can see that that relation is shown between fast and PTRANS .
So, winding phase happens before you make the recursive call okay if you read any recursive algorithms you've taken up any programming course, you probably know what I am talking about.
So, we we’ll we’ll talk about that action previous to the state.
A bat and and this this process of transformation, bat depends on this thing actually.
And both of them are used in practice.
and that is there in fact it is it is part of the script.
Specific decisions like whether I'll be using rule based expert system or whether I'm going to use fuzzy system or whatever will be decided here.
Second, a clear indication of what start and end states and what are the valid states.
Now, you can see that the script contains somebody called P now, we don't know who this P is, P is basically a placeholder.
If you have a move which can check the opponent’s king, it is better.
We are not going to address that right now.
So, that's why that arrow is is targeting the double arrow, okay between the actor and the act.
Okay Looking at picking keeping that thing in mind let us look at this.
Solution space are space, exploration is little complex.
Let us look at the first three representation.
Or or ‘Ram is in love’ does not indicate what's the object of love, whom he loves.
it is quite possible that you you get children all of them having lesser value than the parent and you can’t move forward, that is steepest ascent that is the local maxima problem.
Now, we move to L three one and R zero two.
Some presentations are complex compared with others.
So, so it could do it because the chess playing programs use heuristics based on the way the Garry Kasparov used to play chess.
Well, that is an additional prop that you will have and not others.
We’ll end this module.
that's what it is.
Have we solved everything?
And that’s why it is called feed forward network.
Same.
The heuristic search module, heuristic search method is a method, which is not blind like BFS, DFS and generate and test.
It’s not going to help me much.
If we would like to reach to our goal state, the most important thing is that we are moving and if we’re not moving we'll not be reaching there.
So we’ll explore one .
The sequence of events following in a default way obviously they are scenes and these are the most important things.
Anyway, we are not going to discuss that thing right now.
Now the ants will again start travelling from the very node.
So you can even take that case the first node, second node, third node, fourth node, the last node then the node itself.
The functioning of MiniMax again is like what I have talked about.
And the reuse reusability idea was also built in.
But then, there is a limit also.
And one actually can decide a better representation if we pay a little attention to it, one can write better the rules and the state space in a better way.
Let us begin talking about GA .
Similarly, if you have one cell occupied and next two are empty is a good state to have compared to a cell where the the the other cells are occupied.
We want all missionaries to move from left side to right side, okay .
what if I have a case of only twenty five twenty six cities?
Now there are two things you have for example, there are states one two three four and when you you go to a state you will find the state, remember missionary cannibal there are some states which are not acceptable.
The player starts from some state ok Here in this state, it has B,C,D, E and further and further when we stop, whatever those leaf node values are, static evaluation function is applied and calculated.
The advantage of this method does not demand the amount of memory that the the BFS demands and that’s why this is adopted by many programming languages.
What does that mean?
Now the longer path for example, in ten seconds this ant make five trips, this ant make four trips.
If no city left return back, but otherwise return back with the length and if and then check the length.
And you have to continuously meet and learn from expert in this particular case duration.
How do you find out?
In case of being decreased for a good move this called valley descending.
Now, there are some challenges in this, Okay , and what are the challenges we’ll be looking at but the point is, when we encounter an indication of such scenario, we’ll not only enter the information contained in that statement but contained or assumption that the complete scenario has taken place, we’ll insert everything else Okay .
Now, if you if you ask a chess player given a board position, two board positions which one is better, he would say, this is better or that is better.
Now that adds dynamism to this calculation of SEF .
In fact, TSP what you want to get is the same node back.
You can see now H appears in child one. Now corresponding element, Okay you can see.
So I'm attending my eyes to the match, Okay .
And using that we’ll have a far better estimates of the next move that we are going to take.
So, given an option, opponent will obviously pair.
The first layer and you can say W one prefixes always, okay .
Minus ten to ten is what we have already used.
Okay , problem in our case, the problem is pretty trivial.
But many people believe that it is GA is not part of AI , it is part of soft computing.
So, that is to be so this process is to be continuously repeated for all such paths.
So, this two headers are in possible to be used here and the automated cook can actually decide that Jay does not require the dinner now.
But is an interesting idea and probably a lot of others have used that idea and we are going to stress that idea.
Okay .
If it is not a leaf node, the function proceed further.
Let us go for a second ply and see what difference does it make.
Can we move?
Obviously, two abilities of deer can save.
Something similar you probably have done if you are science student and have tried to find out ions of a given given chemical compound.
There are people involved like waiters and cashiers and and others who serve, hotel manager is the person who take orders and so on so forth.
One way to solve this problem is to have a database of some sort indicating all restaurants of Ahmedabad.
You in frames also you have attributes and their values and and there are some default values which are assumed and and so on so forth.
Now they are explicitly mentioned.
Big problem.
The problem is most of the AI program problem is that they're very, very hard to characterize.
So when we take a move, we come to the next level and again the opponent plays and we get a situation.
okay This is how it is done?
So that's the first requirement.
And probably you can also conclude that Jay is not all that great cricket lover like other Indians.
How it is done?
It’s a double arrow which which is darkened, and it says that height greater than average and you can see the representation - Height and there is a bracket in which you say greater than average.
This is the other example.
sneeze The other one is called EXPEL, forcefully throw out something, for example, when I'm crying, the the tears EXPEL out of my eyes and one more called SPEAK, generate a sound, Okay .
So, that is the issue.
So, even if the prototype is discarded, there is still something positive and very, very important point is that even when you develop a prototype, simplest of prototypes or very, very complex prototype, the most important thing that you encourage people to feedback give feedback and give their suggestion because it's very, very easy to change the prototype is extremely hard to change the final product, okay .
In fact, we've already solved laugh the problem.
So it it’s very important that you provide right set of samples, right set of images.
Remember that plausible move generator is is based on a given game. okay .
Roles, the people who are involved like person who wants to watch the match or booking clerk and security person who show you in and ticket checker who is there.
Second, if this suppose, if you know how to write this function, how you put this function to use.
And it it it get the values on in the slots the attributes and and it can reason.
Something which is not there in the start state but in the end state should be added and actions should do this okay .
Something which has not changed for long, change it and see if you can reach to some solution, okay .
So, I have twenty six in in that case I need outputs, total twenty six outputs.
It is a cycle, Okay .
The only draw drawback of this system is that it it takes more time and more memory , obviously because it it it starts all over again every time.
So, if some script contains something which is possible to be reused, the MOP can do that.
okay .
In fact, the conceptual roles does do you may not find that thing in in in the the statement sometimes but it is derived out of that.
Now state space is a little clumsy in the sense that we we write a lot of like L A B C D.
D is next, so we are copying next D here. Okay .
You can see that ‘Sachin flew to LA.’
So, that is deleted.
One characteristic is highest value of win and least value of using losing.
But, eventually what we get when we use heuristic is is the estimate of how far we are from the goal node.
Okay For a complete binary tree I’ve already talked about number of node is almost double themselves at every level.
So, there is a weight between X zero and H one.
Lot of researchers were interested in learning about this and they have found very, very simple method that they are using for doing this, which is basically implemented in computer program and it can actually used to solve many search algorithms.
We are not going to discuss about them.
Because it as salesman will have to come back to that city.
So, this is called branch and bound, this is some simple method.
Why it is so?
We might end up being on on top of local minima.
So, that is what is being done here.
But please understand that this is not the limitation of CD .
Sometimes the the moves are known as or written as Production rules.
These are just examples of showing state with more heuristic value and less.
So, and what if some other ant has travelled some other path?
And the most complex thing is that when there are multiple rules possible, there are not one, two, three, four rules are possible, which one should I choose?
So the time is always our biggest constraint, exactly like chess.
Now very simple heuristic can be used here.
Why it is called you can see why it is called square.
Now it is actually possible to have around twenty different states.
If it is not what you have to do is to select some out of the complete set.
The chromosome contains genetic map of individual in form of a DNAs, okay .
So this one ply search is not very good.
It’s basically a cumulative value which is made up of multiple components and we’ll be that is also something that we will be looking at.
And the beauty is that once it is done, so, it becomes independent The language is also becomes becoming independent of the words used to represent that concept.
The first thing, for an input, for example, I I am taking a very simple case of recognizing an image.
The selection process only chooses better candidates based on the fitness value. okay .
The same thing is happening here.
If I also want lower and upper case it is sixty two total.
And how it is done?
Guided search methods use heuristics.
C on top of D is deleted.
I'm not going to play C, what's the point?
Because chess is much more structured structured than many other cases, many other games, even table tennis.
Now interestingly there is one action, we are putting A on table.
M plus C can be one, so one person can row the boat or M plus C can be two.
But the Sigma is basically summing up everything that comes in.
There was a game and there was a system called Bstar which was designed by a chess player as well as a computer scientist and he decided that I'll explore till I get some kind of questions, some kind of stability in in in the system.
And we have already seen that it is possible to learn from the domain which moves are better than others.
It it is not.
What will be the terminating criteria for the we we already seen that the time obviously is one.
You’re you're doing nothing you won't achieve anything out of but playing at the corner which is shown in B, we have two possible options.
Like when you say that ‘When I I went to watch a match’, which basically represents many things into one. How that is done, we’ll we’ll we’ll be looking at in scripts the next module.
Now, later on when the speaker utters something else, which which prohibits one of the branches, other two branches can still be explored.
We have also seen some of the advantages are as well as the shortcomings of CD .
In this case, a chromosome is a string, simple.okay .
So, this is the other example which neural network program can solve.
Not only that, there's one more thing.
One is farmer, two is fox, four is chicken and eight is grain.
You can see that, and it's called direction case.
And as I said, the algorithms are not fool-proof, the algorithm may not correctly classify.
Now, we are going to study in little more detail.
I We have named it as Unguided Search Methods.
So, when I say that Irfan is Irfan height Irfan is tall.
Think of it.
This is one way of representing.
We are not talking about domain knowledge, we are not talking about anything, we are just talking about resemblance of the intermediate state with the final state and the start state.
And remember, in our previous example that we took, M value is twenty-two.
Okay We have also seen how you decide number of input, output and hidden units.
Guided Search Methods actually use heuristics where you can you can say that this move is better than the other , or some some estimate about how good or bad a particular move is. deep breath
Okay , so that's the that's the saving that you will have okay . Obviously you're paying the price but
And if you start taking the other path A to B and D, it's already crossing two fifty and you you won’t go further.
They see if the the fingerprint is curved or square or broken or things like that.
So somehow BDC is used.
Depth Bound Depth-first search is, there is some limit you decide.
For example, this thing Mahesh hurt Jayesh by throwing stones.
No difference okay .
It's impossible because you don't have measuring device.
GA is about searching in solution space.
So you can conclude that his favorite team has won.
If it is not, I’ll go to the first step.
One, you pick up the first state, second state, third state start applying rules and go ahead.
Based on this we can draw a search graph or tree like shown in the next slide.
We, opponent. We, opponent.
You just travel first path record minimum, consider that as a minimum path, travel next path if it is more than minimum just terminate it from there and skip all branches and so on, okay and this branch and bound is great, if you have chosen somehow has some heuristic which can help you choose shorter paths before you'll be able to gain a lot out of this, okay .
One you travel further and say that because he wanted to know who has come to bat Okay who is going to come to bat.
And if you if you can somehow manage that it becomes easier for us to choose moves which are better and complete the search process in real time.
We’ll also look at two other methods of search called branch and bound and refinement search in in this particular module.
And mathematically representing this part is also possible.
Why?
The best is obviously C, so you would choose to play the second.
Sometimes a small statement will require two to three pages, full of conceptualizations.
So you can't conclude everything. So this is again an example of the power of script.
First, they guide the developer in learning about what's the system, what exactly is the system, what is going to come in, what’s going to be…So, for example, the forms which which we call in conventional system, they are called forms.
So I I'm taking fox but you can easily take grain on the other side.
Chess, is very structured compared to others and seemingly complicated problem but comparatively more structured so people have solved that problem and there are many other problems which are not possible to be solved for example, rating an essay.
What is solution?
So, point is such things depends on context.
What you need?
So that's quite similar.
The first prerequisite is a it works In fact back propagation is used in many forms in many places .
I I may say that height equal to or or I say height in the bracket six point two.
Similar example is some surveillance case, okay .
Number of components as I said large number of companies is not very good.
Okay , so that is again, very, very important.
Bit number one is farmer, bit number two is fox, bit number three is chicken, bit number four is grain.
So, like that when you encounter a statement where you can replace that placeholder, it is it is done that way.
So, I have that option.
Now it's very interesting how the values is is passed in this case because this is a minimizing level the last level the sixth level is minimizing level.
So, there are two components involved.
Image of some other object is provided and it says it is the friend.
So total is basically collected from all ants travelled on that path and those ants which have not travelled on that path they’ll not contribute, okay .
So what should I choose?
Eventually you will find that you will have all missionaries and cannibals on the right hand side.
So okay , so that's the point.
Now, the first node that we generate is minus one , which is obviously not as good.
so you you change things in a way when you you have two strings, two parents when they meet, you you do not get a string with similar characteristic,
‘Do’ may come later.
Similarly, the statement here is converted to some basic collection of some basic primitives.
Recognizing somebody is one example.
Okay , now, the complete sequence of moves.
okay There are three arguments passed to the algorithm, the current player the depth value and the heuristic of players identity.
And you will have to do it again, second epoch, third epoch.
Instead of zero, we accept point one, instead of one, we accept point nine, just because of this problem.
Everything on the right hand side.
And exactly you can see on the slide, one solution which begins from eight zero zero.
Well, that's what I said in the beginning that you can use CD as an interlingua.
In some cases, yes, okay .
That is the beginning part of the conceptualization and then normal user is also invoked.
Let me know, L two zero R one three and B L.
The essence is picked up and used.
So, I'm I'm not or for example, there are twenty moves and Ill just choose two.
Please also understand that this relevant part has nothing to do with heuristics.
You can see that the PPT talks about the obstacle and the ants are finding.
We have we say that L A B C D, e R E F G H okay and then say A plus E is equal to one.
Not only that, formalization also talks about checkpoints and deadlines and it will give you a timeline then, in two months’ time, this is part is to be done, next two months, this is to be done and so on, so forth.
Okay .
This is what we want.
So, we we do late binding.
So, that can generalize.
We meet people and decide this is a good person and this is a bad person, this is not so nice person and so on and so forth.
Pick up the start node and make it current.
Goal stack planning is again a very simple way of planning.
But that is not happening here.
Okay .
The opponent.
Nearest neighbor was only for TSP .
We move on to the state called three five zero where we are applying rule number nine and so on .
’ Now, that is used as an instrument for the other conceptualizations to take place.
Now, those weights every remember, every input unit is connected to every output unit.
Now, when I have explored only first ply, B looked promising.
And finally, we'll write this and why this is written the the lower part of on this is complete goal description.
Now, here k again is a layer which I was talking about.
okay , Many a times expert will not be able to tell the KE that I'm I’m solving this problem this way.
Mahesh throws a stone and that is an object to to hurt Jayesh.
So, in fact, you may see that why the hidden unit is provided?
For example, I'm I'm I’m at a typical place in in in eight, zero eight, five, three gallon water jug problem.
It just gives you an estimate, Okay and there are some mathematical ways of judging how estimate is near to the correct value and so on, so forth.
Mahesh hurting Jayesh and second Mahesh is also throwing a stone.
So this is the solutions search.
That is exactly what's happening here and it is in PPT is it is bold-faced.
In this particular module, we have seen branch and bound, we have looked at in the In fact, we began with ant colony optimization and we looked at how ant find the food source and then how one can mimic a computer program to do the same.
And all four of the prerequisites must match , okay .
For example, here you get a slanting line like this and this and a horizontal line, you can call it A, irrespective of which picture which pixel is it illuminates and which pixel it doesn't.
We have three units.
It contain two things, one is path, which is basically a string talking about more X and Y than Z and so on.
So, the next slide talks about this process in a little more detail.
For example, pick up a word called ‘Love’.
They they pick up random solutions in the beginning.
So, second one is little better and it is not going to lead us to draw, lose if you if you see that, that thing, the second move, there's no chance that we'll get a lose okay .
If A is Fr farmer is on that side.
If you have seen the the algorithm cleverly, you you would see that the the value that we return is is also written in negative form.
Suppose if there are two ants, one travels here, the other travel through a longer path and both of them have found their the same food source.
What the other example we have shown on the the slide the.. how to build a robot which can do all household chores?
The other method that we’ve seen is called best first search.
For square it is not, okay .
But then here are exam…you already have the paths ready.
Can should I explore J?
The first process - Selection.
Done.
So that path will no longer, not look attractive if the ant has not found the food source.
Theres no technical reason okay .
Okay , we're not talking about because here in in the simplest representation, we have not talked about fellow spectators, we have not talked about umpires, we have not talked about assuming a cricket match, we have not talked about the ball boys and all that.
So, they are related by a single single sided because the dependency is only on one direction and there is an indicator O which indicates that is an object for this particular action.
And the other one is described an action aider.
That person is six point two inches tall or height greater than average is example of is taller than an average cricket player.
That information is directly copied in and you don't even require expert’s help there because that is readily available, you just have to convert that thing to digital form.
Rajan wanted it.
You've seen number of variables and number of symbols that one can use and and or and so on so forth.
We have talked about this in past.
‘Jay went to watch an ODI, he was late, when he occupied his seat, asked his fellow spectator who won the toss?
There is no complexity here actually.
ok the like hill climbing or simulated annealing or something similar.
How bike and that PTRANS is related okay , PROPEL, sorry is related.
It it collects those big bunch of structures, match and that matching is done by something else.
If you use branch and bound we’ll try travelling in this direction continuously for a quite large period and that's why it takes it will take more time in converging.
So, if you want to write a general purpose problem solver for chess it’s very, very hard it’s almost impossible.
The other one is losing and a third one is a draw.
Whether I get my salary right or I don't get it right.
But, the one which I'm talking about backpropagation neural network the BPNN which is the most used algorithm requires the network to be complete.
What we are going to talk about is preliminary, a few basic things about neural networks.
This state actually converts the formalized content into the code that is the minimum thing that you do in this phase and it’s very cruc…crucial part is KE and developer communication.
Neuron is very tiny thing and it uses electrochemical reactions, okay , the the signaling process to send and receive.
So that's an example of an an invalid move.
Now, we have already seen Sachin went to LA.
So that’s that's what I’m doing in fact.
Now why should I be not exploring the next one?
Some algorithms, which we are going to study later requires this function to be continuous. Okay , so we have sigmoid function is to be used.
So, that's the case here.
Object bat.
But you can see that I I I'm exploring J.
Now the other string contains something A, D, E, F and now it has some cities which are already occurring here.
Okay , sometimes you you will want to specify the time, for example, Milkha Singh ran yesterday, then that arrow will have that information, so that is sometimes called T, T represent time and there are some action aiders, for example, when you say Milkha Singh ran yesterday, that yesterday is called action aider.
For example, one typical example I could quote from Mahabharat is Purochan endangered Pandavas.
We get three and two.
And, that’s why it is represented in in a little darker fashion.
You can see the right hand side we have the mapping.
I was talking about those twenty then pick up five; so these twenty strings that you pickup in the beginning is called a solution set or is called population. okay .
The lowermost part is called unwinding phase.
See the prerequisites there are four prerequisites in this state space representation.
Now, as I say I have five, so it will pick up one and five or pickup two and three and pick up one and four and so on.
So, it moves. The ownership is moved from Sachin to Sarfaraz okay .
What is a learning?
Simple, you cut some part of the string and paste some part elsewhere and the other one you apply fitness function to the string finding out how good or fit this particular string is.
Before that calling, every every statement that is a key booted in this particular function will be executed before that call is.
That means this path is more attractive.
But the problem is, I have to decide number of missionaries and cannibals, which I did .
And And like the previous case we have four which has two and three and you you cannot go because it’s it’s worse.
Now how can I remove all that?
You have all four of them on one side and in the initial state, all four of them on the right side in the final state.
So it begins with A.
where we we can see that even even a trivial problem like travelling salesman result into a serious combinatorial explosion.
Farmer, fox, chicken and grain on the left-hand side, nothing on the right hand side.
The next level is thirty five into thirty five into thirty five minus whatever you’ve explored so far.
Because, you're going there, now you stop and now you're returning back.
If dead end, we’ll try the right child and again left.
For example, for a given node I have twenty children,
How can I have it? Fine!
And again, we'll see a few examples of complex statements, how those complex statements can be represented using multiple primitives together okay .
It is it is like this, okay it is basically a discrete function, for all negative values it is zero , for all positive values it is plus one.
If you don't do that,it will be eaten up.
But simple.
So but we’re doing it, Okay so we’re we’re picking up, we’re we’re taking that as correct and we’re going forward.
Additionally, we also seen the SEF being a a composite structure it contains it’s basically a weighted value okay multiple components multiplied by their respective weights.
In short you can use moves to move around in state space and reach to the solution.
There is no ISA relationship.
The subscript order is the designer’s choice, there is no fixed rule.
So, that is very good actually.
The idea is when when you say that I had five hundred rupees, I went to Jungle Book and had my dinner.
Okay Let us begin with the introduction of something called heuristic function.
How number of inputs and output unit and the hidden unit are decided?
Anyway, these are not all are important things, just to make sure you understand what we are talking about.
So, the inputs flow in the forward direction and whenever the input flows, the output layer checks whether the output is right or wrong.
In fact I just said that for twenty employees, each of the employees I I have fifty images.
The syntactic rules okay , the second one talks about the the relation between an actor and the attribute of the actor or PP and PA , okay .
So, point is the roles even viewing a match role would change, Okay .
We don't really know, in fact.
Same.
The idea of using simple systems and combining them, the the power is quite unique.
But not in all cases.
You’re paying you probably have dined, Okay .
And after implementation planning, obviously the last phase implementation starts.
What is the disadvantage?
Okay , We'll talk about some of them in in due course. And set of rules.
Now you can see that the parent one B, G and A there are B, G and A, they are not to be copied into the child.
For example, the other example Jay went to Epicurean which is basically a name of a restaurant which is there in Ahmedabad with his colleagues of his of the office.
A recursive function is a function, where a call to itself is made somewhere in between, so whatever you've done before is called winding phase and the next phase is the recursive call to that function.
So, if you're sitting with an expert, you’ll have to learn all that because the rules are going to come in form of that jargon and you’ll have to convert that thing into the knowledge base.
Look at the the sigmoid function you will be able to see.
The conceptualization, remember I had said in the previous module, the conceptualization is quite similar to the analysis in conventional system design process.
The chicken and the farmer, both of them can go on the right side and the job is done.
You may not repeat, but if you do if you are not repeating what you are supposed to do is to remember the entire tree.
So it's good that you explore multiple nodes.
Now, seriously ill is minus nine and so on and so forth.
Now, interestingly, when you start doing it this way, there can be three different types of outputs.
So that’s the problem withs this method.
I’m not doing it blindly and that’s why this is called guided search and not blind search or unguided search.
There are three basic operations.
Remember the tour cost for example, in this case, one ABCD is so far two twenty plus two fifty plus one fifty that is six twenty.
So, validate the prototype comes next.
So, and sometimes an additional value is provided.
Maintenance and extension is also part of this part, but the maintenance is not only maintaining the expert system, but continuously improving it for quite some time.
So if if all possible cases are explored together, if one of if the later, he uttered some word which prohibits one of the translations, the other translations can still be tried.
You can see that ‘R’ okay and other thing also we have seen.
It is due to in the the human and other spaces, it is basically due to external influences like radiation.
From this five generate twenty, throw this five, out of this twenty again pick up up five, throw rest so and so forth.
So, everybody is roped in now and we have a bigger team in this particular phase.
When it is omitted it is the default value is is Milkha Singh himself.
The rule number fourteen is one of the simplest.
Not only that, we have many heuristics possible, we have already talked about heuristics.
So, we'll be talking about them.
And you pick up first five and so on.
Now you are surprised the earlier example we had twelve moves.
Maybe farmer.
So, to code program robots, one needs to use this kind of logic.
It's an excellent idea in fact.
5,3,0 one output is 3,5,0 and 5,0,3 both of them are already explored so we’ll not look at them. The rest of the tree is just explored the same way.
Now, in in look at the weights okay .
You try to explore all possible states and you become more conscious about In a way you're applying dense neighbourhood function even when the situation becomes critical.
Now the most important part, we would like to solve travelling salesman problem using GA .
Product release is also planned.
When we write general rules , the problem is that there is there has to be something.
Okay .
So, you should try to mitigate the the consequences if the decision is wrong and how you do that is also to be part of this thing.
The issue is that in case of G, if in in most handwritten case recognition, you will not find that horizontal line.
Okay , many a times we look at things and classify them.
Okay .
For example, you you doing hill climbing and you stuck there.
How you assume?
So many paths are avoided using this branch and bound.
One is called the Ontological memory which, remember this was a problem with the the CD as well as script.
Unwinding part on the contrary is very important here because that happens in in in the reverse order.
So, all three of them are shown on the screen and as all three possible outcomes that we have.
How will you do that?
We’d like to have a better heuristic value so we’ll not move further.
This is just one way of doing it.
And when information is missing, like ‘Sachin flew to LA’ and all that, where where where the information is not complete.
Two choices and if I play B, I'm guaranteed to get minus three okay? .
So, these are also points that one must learn but it is very interesting how back propagation manages it.
PDDL as I said is used for this purpose.
Now there is a single word ‘ate’.
Now, there are two things happening.
So, in branch and bound however good it is, it does not have any sense of direction in true sense.
Learning faster is not always advisable.
But again theoretically if you want a proof that the problem is given will surely solve, that is not possible.
So is it kind of a dead end or or loss, Okay , a failure.
So it is right.
Thank you!
We’ll be discussing about the back-propagation algorithm that we mentioned in the previous module.
They actually begins with solution search method.
Before we embark on the real algorithm, there's one more word which is commonly used in the literature called W and B.
It is possible to choose a function which produces less number of nodes which is called Sparse neighbourhood function or I can have more number of nodes which is called Dense neighbourhood function.
It is not applied elsewhere.
Current player actually is either we or the opponent.
You may take up some other course on object oriented programming to understand what is the usefulness and importance of it.
That means that now we have M one minus M missionaries on left side, C one minus C missionaries on the left hand side, that must fulfill this condition.
okay.
you get a string with very, very different characteristic,
If the first player has played something the second player will not be in a position to use that.
What does that mean?
Unguided Search Methods means, we don't use heuristics , but we use simple methods to search from the initial state.
You have to decide how knowledge base is going to process the queries of the users.
So, is either on the left hand side or the right hand side.
So, this is an example of a relevant progression.
For missionary cannibal reconstructive search method is a little better because it’s easier.
But you can see that there are two indicators, two headers.
So we like to increase that , in the other this thing we will like to reduce total amount of distance covered.
When you do something in your mind, conceive an idea or or build something within your mind, it is called MBUILD , that is represented by a primitive called MBUILD .
And what we get at the end, you can see that I get two different answers.
So out of ten if I if I can only change two.
In GA , we know that the solutions are broken apart and reconnected and find best solutions.
So, based on this, we’ll decide number of output units.
Z is amount of milk in the three gallon jug.
That’s why the word optimization appears in this case and also it’s very interesting that the ants can also rediscover the short path the shortest path, how they do it?
The place where I hang my keys is the other.
Now you can look at this and see if placing C on the table whether it is nearer to start state placing C on the table is added while you move back.
But again, for the classification also that is a generate and test.
Okay , the method itself is called Crossover.
Better offspring offspring have more chances of survival and then next generation is genetically better. Okay
It is possible that you miss an optimum par, you miss a solution altogether.
how many?
It is impossible.
So, let us see what we can do.
I’ll not reach to solution after this, Okay .
So, these are examples.
See, we’re not doing exploring it like hill climbing, Okay .
So and there is something called picture aiders which which talks about the attributes of the object.
You have to continue doing it unless and until you get the final result.
All all these statements basically mean the same.
This one.
okay , the genetic footprint of anybody is called a genome.
Now, that is going to be troublesome.
Lot of abnormal cases might be there because every other system says that it is malaria, but the patient has typhoid.
okay .
Second, we’ll only be taking one move.
Minus ten.
Okay but then there is one more thing > Okay .
One important aspect of the process is moving from the initial state to the final state.
For example, when you find a statement called Jay want went to watch a match.
Now, once you say that Milkha Singh ran, it is done, but when you say Milkha Singh ran in Pakistan, that additional is location.
He answered, India has won the toss and invited South Africa to bat.
There is something else called Ordinal Representation.
Because start says the first state, zero is the depth and zero is the player who is playing.
One more primitive is called INGEST, taking something from outside.
NodeInfo object contains these two value and NodeInfo contains one is path the other is value.
We can say that H one equal to why it is one, because X zero is always one, into W one zero one.
Irrespective of what is the value of the other one. Other one maybe ten, that is better, but is always five or more.
Obviously, I want to identify not only A but if suppose if I'm interested in finding out all uppercase letters.
You you shouldn't have very large number of components because it’s going to reduce the the search time.
We will continue picking up nearest cities and eventually we will get the the the complete list of cities.
Attribute with an actor is also possible to be used.
If KE might look at different alternatives and decide the best one and it is quite possible that KE might probably have not understood what expert has said.
You’ll have to search for final state and that’s precisely is the is the important part of this particular module.
You will try to actually explore more number of nodes.
Because the the heuristic function value in this case is decreasing and not increasing.
So, action adds something.
but in a way we are not going to discuss that further in this particular module.
At no point of time the missionary should be less, okay .
I can move to six,zero,two.
So, that D appears on that three-prong structure that indicates direction and it is also when there is a direction, there is a source and there is a destination.
Well, some authors even get even use real values as well.
It just does not depend on that time.
Here is the description.
Then min, then max, then min, then max and so on.
When we reach to the the sixth ply, our time gets over.
So that is represented in the handout, you can see that there is a double arrow between I and MTRANS which indicates double dependency.
And they are called conceptual categories, this PP picture producer, PA picture aiders and ACT and location and time and all that together are called conceptual categories.
Now, if I want to place A on top of Y X on top of Y, A on top of B, there are two things required, the preconditions both of them must be free which is shown in the preconditions tag of the action description.
So, you decides about knowledge representation system.
But the rest as I have said you can use that heuristic to find out the path which is there.
Now how will I how will you write that problem? I'm not asking for a solution. How will you characterize the problem? It's not that easy.
Because things are decided, things are processed and not only that, they they also require to change more frequently than conventional systems.
Every time you do it okay , so that is what MiniMax algorithm is.
Now, again you will come across the same dilemma that you had before.
The remaining part talks about a very simple improvement that that we can make.
There are parallel scenes, there are alternate scenes.
what are the classes involved?
When this particular user is to be blocked?
Roles are people who are involved in the script and this is a general assumption and that might change.
You may get the child two in a similar fashion and this is how the order crossover works.
For example, when you see, the information is coming from eyes, when you hear, the information is coming from ears, when you touch and feel, the information coming from the other senses and so on so forth.
So that additional Pakistan will have a link and that link will indicate LOC, that means that link describes the location where this particular action has happened.
There are in fact it's there in the center diagonal lines, two diagonal lines, two horizontal and vertical line the middle column, the middle row and both diagonal lines are possible for you to cover in this case.
So, two conditions: A dot addition’s intersection GS must be a non -empty set and A dot deletion intersection GS must be an empty set.
Now in this particular case this maybe the best tour, if this gives me and how do you decide?
And we have already seen that AI programs don't have AI problems don't have the algorithms , AI solutions don't have the algorithms, so you you just don't have a a a clear cut method to begin from initial state to reach to the final state.
It can also be used as inter lingua actually, so if if you convert an English statement into a CD form, that CD form can be converted to any other language.
Okay , something which can which can lead to solution.Consider okay .
If I explore it just one level in chess, I'll have to apply to thirty-five states.
The first one selects the best members of the population, remember I was talking about five out of twenty.
Okay , B plus F is two.
Because when you talk about anything, it depends on context.
Probably you will have be able to reason with and get those values filled in.
You hear the record and organize the knowledge structure.
And validation normally is done by the designing expert.
E F G H is also farmer, fox, chicken, grain but then some other values.
And exactly opposite is regression.
For example, genes will decide the color of the skin and the the type of teeth and the color of eyes and so and so forth.
You don't have that knowledge stored in expert’s mind or KE’s mind that is to be verbalized, and this is the the other part.
Not only that, the expert also learns something out of it.
So, they the the biggest advantage of using ant colony optimization is that it is possible to rediscover the shortest path, if there is a problem.
But we cannot just arbitrarily add or remove components, we’ll have to apply actions and we cannot even apply actions arbitrarily, we’ll have to make sure that the prerequisites for that action must exist and if it is not there we have to generate that state with a precondition for which we’ll have to apply some other action.
We’ll soon see.
So that's what this first representation do.
And C and F as I said that they are directly copied because there is they are not part of the map.
You can't move forward.
So Jungle Book is is a restaurant.
When I tell you that I went to watch a match, you you assume a lot of things.
if you taken a path, you can't come back.
You can see that there is a threat from knight to the king.
Well when we reach to an unreachable or unaccepted.
okay So, that is how this thing processes, because this recursive function there are three different components, winding, call and unwinding.
That means there is a black pawn at position i and j and j equal to seven.
We have no option.
Second is quite also.
So, the point is, this ant colony optimization method is based on these two simple parameters, whether the path is recent or whether this path is travelled by multiple agents.
Now there are two alternatives and and remember I'm not looking at the lower most level now.
okay , when you talk about a soldier fit, does not and fit when you say plus eight, he is really fit.
So, that's what we write.
The fourth step is collection of nodes and whatever we have discussed and we have also studied how we decide the best value and why that best value is good.
So this alpha and beta cut-offs are also applied to MiniMax in most cases which improves the the algorithm further.
If the opponent makes a mistake, I may even get five.
This is the first other search method that we are going to see.
So you can sacrifice your queen to kill that pawn in in in some cases.
Now, if you encounter this statement, you you also expect a lot of additional things.
A parent maybe a children, to a children and so on, so forth.
So, it learns faster.
okay , so every time we'll do this process.
So I I looked at both innings, I'm happy if my team has won, I'm not happy if my team has lost and so on so forth.
Now, that second level of tree.
Quite similar to the plan space planning which we have talked about long back.
Though we have used words in English, basically, they are they are placeholders, okay .
I may say that I'll only change two of the states.
Here the conceptualization process actually starts.
I just wanted to highlight the negation.
One thing you probably think that more number of components,more precise your measurement and better it is.
You can see 8-0-0, 5-0-3, 0-5-3, 3-5-0, 8-0-0.
The complexity lies in the moves.
In this case, we don’t do it.
Now, if you look at that figure, it is the initial position when j is seven, indicates that it is the initial position of that black piece.
How a output unit learns to remain active and for example is provided to it.
Remember we will have to have set of better solutions and combines their parents randomly and combine good elements of parents and so and so forth.
We may end up on a dead end because you explore only two and there are no both of them are dead ends, okay .
You can see that.
The heuristic value is just an estimate.
You just pour milk from here to here and here back , you won't get to a solution , but you won't come to an end as well.
Lot of people play a lot of different ways.
If you have two cannibals on the right hand side, you have to send two missionaries on the right hand side and so on so forth.
But then I would say, give me all positions of that. How many such matrices you will provide? Think of it.
Looking at the results, the candidate structures are are calculated and checked for a match, Okay .
And this change, for example, if you go out to have watch a cricket match and you buy a pavilion ticket, you probably will have an additional food coupon.
Because we are going to give very clear visibility to every stakeholder.
Okay , let us look at one important factor that was best first search.
So, that also is very, very important and technical nuances that you probably can use like taking direct data from IMD into medical system or storing data directly in the cloud.
How it is done, we’ll see later.
Only when those prerequisites are met, you can apply that rule, otherwise not.
What does that mean? You pour milk from eight gallon jug to five gallon jug and pour it back .
W is win,L is loss and D is draw.
But then nearest neighbor does not give you any guarantee for optimal solution.
So, that is that should have a higher heuristic value.
So, the longer the path, less the pheromone value.
B and C is exchange, D and C is exchange, E and D is exchange, F and E is exchange and F G and F is exchange.
So not answer those statements like ‘Jay went to the stadium, he bought a ticket’ and so on so forth.
It's very likely that the third ant will follow this path.
Now that’s little difficult to understand at the first shot but let me explain that in brief.
That probability does not remain the same.
One is four, which is same so we’ll not go for that.
So, what do you want to do is you just have to achieve B on top of A and A is on top of table, that's what we want only two things to be done.
The one more possibility is 0,5,3.
It generates optimal paths again when there is an obstacle placed and there are three good things about it.
Everybody is on the right hand side.
One of them is called simulated hill climbing for example.
It doesn't force it prematurely.
You will have to find out those areas and make sure that they are addressed and and the performance is improved to the extent that is acceptable at expert level.
So, every day there are five thousand applications coming in.
So, whether you're doing it well, if you're not doing it well, whether your plan contains managing uncertainties - these are crucial ingredients for making the system run for a longer period.
In fact, one of the programs Schank wrote was called SAM Okay , which can understand, reads like stories like this and and can reason from it, Okay .
So that is the next one, but if the total is less than three, you can pour everything here and this becomes completely empty .
It is quite possible in the script, some scenes are not executed at all.
Now the exit condition of one particular script and the entry condition of the other script, you will have to join them.
But technically there's no difference.
The the nucleus’ job is done by a function called the Sigma, okay .
Now state space says L A B C D and R E F G H.
The the different components which you want to solve and for every component it adds an action and once the complete stack is done, we’ll run that thing and see if it gets the goal and it is very, very important because it is quite possible that an action might have a side effect which undo what some other action previously done action is done, okay .
There's few there are few things which are worth pointing out.
For example, I want to have C on D and I say that place on top CD I would like to execute that but the precondition says that the C and D both must be free.
You can see that his representation is almost the same as we have seen before.
But then two important principals which I have already to talked about let me reiterate them.
Now why that is better?
We have also seen what are the what are the challenges in this.
When you you go to restaurant after ten-fifteen experience you you probably expect everything waiters and all that very, very clearly.
So, okay , once the tentative plan is ready, you can start with actual implementation.
SEF returns what?
And later stage you don't.
Not only that, you can even go ahead and pick up some other brands, some other node which is better than three, you can do it.
And the you can see the row the next one the row value.
You cannot change its size, because that’s the input, that’s the image that is coming in, you cannot change that.
And looking at the later statement, if it is found that he has really went go went to watch the match, you can insert those things later and not not right now.
Similarly, when you talk about run, you're transferring your your own self, throw, you have move or or catch, okay , you you are the recipient of that PTRANS movement, okay .
Explore the tree as long as you can get the static evolution function value, back the things up , till the topmost node, based on that pick up the best move from there on.
Thank you all.
But then might not give you exact answer may not be optimal, may not be as in some cases may not give you even good answers.okay .
The the beauty is that it stores information in distributed fashion and not a localized fashion like computer programs.
So what you can do is you can in the next cycle you can explore them before others and see how expensive they are in the next case and you can omit some of the branches, Okay .
Again we are not going to do that further here.
K also can be there in the beginning, okay .
So, the various senses the information is coming in and it is being sent to CP , okay .
As soon as the person completes the sentence, it is to be translated and and delivered to the participant.
We have only two rules and we have only few prerequisites so far.
Now you may be surprised why you are doing that.
Okay you can see that script it contains few things one is called entry condition.
Okay what's the difference?
In the beginning , will start with start state zero zero.
That's the issue.
Even in household today, robots have becoming pretty common today.
You said that I'm going to use NMR or I'm going to add fuzzy component in it, or I'll use certainty factors here.
So chicken is taken back, and then you pick up grain and take it on the other side.
okay So, heuristic value also is negated.
And as I said objective function is the same thing as heuristic.
In that case it is five hundred into five hundred inputs and so on so forth.
Second question that, what are the impacts of these decisions?
Now that is also simple but quite effective in some cases.
So we are not discussing the rest of them.
So, what people are going to input the reports, what people are going to see as an output, the key concepts involved in this process.
How you decide that this process is malicious?
Now we are writing the value of the variable.
We don't really know what the source is.
That is called planning, okay .
Now what is branch and bounds?
Ram killed Ravan.
So, that ‘with a friend’ is represented like this.
We begin with the exploration.
In a normal case when you say that ‘fit’, somebody who can walk two to three or ten, five five-six kilometers maximum, not more.
For example, he would say that when you decide, okay , what are the decision you made.
Now, let us look at the travelling salesman problem.
But, the point is though it looks expensive in the face of it, it is not so.
If all three consecutive states all three consecutive cells are occupied by opponent, it is minus ten.
When it finds something which is unusual, something which is not mentioned in the scene at all Okay , it can understand.
So it is and this search process maybe quite jittery that moves across different branches and so on, so forth.
It’s a nine into nine matrix.
It is also possible to indicate that there is a transition, there is something which is happening and here it it gets concluded, Okay .
So, that also it it is the negative value of threshold.
how do you do that?
When it reaches to the calling node, we'll have the complete path.
How it's state is chosen?
So, that is X one to X eighty-one information provided okay .
The child one is B, G, A child two is B, D, E and that is what we mean by mapping.
In this particular module, we are going to see simple , simplest of them called Unguided Search Methods .
okay , so but the point is heuristics usually help and we need heuristics.
We again do not have any measuring device with us.
The figure clearly indicates how it is moving because it’s moving in the direction of the arrow, okay .
We assume that it is A,Irrespective of the size or orientation or wherever it is.
We would like to add components which are not there in the start state they're in the end state.
Okay So, if you can do that, what is the advantage?
I I'll cut them at the same place, I I pick up this part and paste it here, pick up the first string path and paste it here. Okay .
For example, let let let us try to understand, if I take single point crossover is it going to work?
Can you try to understand what they are?
What he did, he wrote a an artificial intelligence program based on neural networks and when he could do it the advantage of that program is that could shortlist those five thousand resumes into just five hundred and expert’s work is reduced tenfold, okay .
What will happen is there are two paths available now.
That is not allowed.
In our case we pick up a range from minus ten to ten. Minus ten is losing plus ten is winning but then some other value indicates how promising that node is.
And and the events are connected to each other.
If you if you if you have a football match viewing then there is some difference.
Okay .
Okay and the final state is everything on the right hand side so it says L not Fr, not fx, not ch, not grain.
Think of representing a problem of rating an essay or rating a post using a state space and you learnt that it is not that easy.
So, here the symbols are explained the next slide.
DNA in turn contains genes, okay which basic building blocks.
You probably think that it is possible.
It also calculates the error coming back and so on, so forth.
So that is the problem with hill climbing.
That is called State Space two.
It says everybody is on the left hand side, nothing nobody is on the left hand side, everybody is on the right hand side.
We don't really know . Right now, we don't really know.
For example, throw also involves moving of body body part, okay , so that involves the other primitive, which we talk about later called ‘Move’, moving a body part.
Anyway, there are two two questions that you’d probably ask before we proceed further.
So when I get stability, the moves are not changing much, the state space is not changing much, I believe that is the is the right time to stop and I'll stop.
So what you do is, you just check for those impossibilities.
For example, after three years of service, you probably give one foreign trip with spouse to every employee or you have if you have two children, you pay the school fees for those two childrens and the other cost, you bear those costs and so on, so forth.
But in simulated annealing there is no temperature.
Now that node maybe maybe little bad that that node may may not be as good as it looks at the first shot.
In fact, the IBM people took three to four years to build this and they spent a lot of money on it rather than though it has beaten Gary Kasparov, I must say that is actually a testimony to that genius for which they have done so much hard work to beat him only three two.
So it is A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I and it is a little longer and littler different.
okay And that is important.
One more method is to pick up depth-first search, we only pick up one typical branch of the tree and explore it continuously and come to a dead end, we take up the next branch and so and so forth.
So, that always you need to have some optimum number of such components.
Single conceptual entity represents the event.
No , it is not that structured, it is very hard.
Okay , so sometimes some authors combine few rules together, sometimes some authors even use a general rule which which actually represent multiple rules together and so on so forth. So, you won't find the matching.
You see the example, minus five, four and zero four three.
So, there are some specific primitives, we’ll be looking at them basic building blocks, and those around those building blocks, the structures are generated and those structures are used to represent simplest things about the world.
Now the preconditions .
Now, let us look at this back propagation network.
okay The over function thus returns the structure okay So, node infrastructure which is very important for us .
okay you can't check all the permutations and combinations real time there's no panacea, there's nothing which solves all problems.
Expectation of a normal user and a new normal user expects you to sympathize if he's having a serious disease or something like that.
He can he can walk twenty kilometers without a problem.
So there are many other tours possible.
So, there's the other solution here is PAM and there are a few other attempts which are mentioned in the the knowledge representation and there are two description logic and the on the Web Ontology Language.
Right set of motivational strategies for employees.
But if you want to write a computer program probably you will have to represent that thing as as the state space which we talked about and do all this jugglery and also you'll have to in fact, here I have not talked about how to represent, how to write moves.
So, there is no destination shown here.
What we do is out of twenty we just apply fitness function like heuristic function, it is like top five or top six or whatever. okay .
to that algorithm decides.
There are a few other things.
and and it inherits from parents to children,
In fact, I have avoided using O Milkha Singh object okay and that that relationship I have not written here to indicate that sometimes you can even omit that.
You take the summation further and if the value is more, so will continue increasing it you will get a better value.
In fact, there is one more important type of learning which is left.
So, there is another point.
It It fails there and in case of best first search we don’t do it.
So if it is not working that fast it’s not going to be that useful, that that powerful.
For example, when I'm talking about bank and if the context is financial, you know that it’s a financial institute which lends money, allows me to have an account and then withdraw and deposit money and so on so forth.
Only farmer can row the boat.
The solution space ready, and you initialize the solution using a very simple thing.
Some authors describe the the layer in the beginning.
M plus L, two plus one, three, zero plus three, three.
I've already discussed this.
For example, an example is given in the handout I'm I’m just quoting that example.
So if we back it one more level up what will happen?
Simplicity is one, readability is the other.
If you use sparse what you can do is you can just replace it by the remaining.
A is what?
in the beginning you may prefer that, yes it it it it is five, it is good, so we should.
So it begins with null.
What should it be?
Images of the friend that we would like to recognize and some other images, with only two things.
So conceptualization and putting it into a proper form which experts can also view and once the expert views it, he will be able to validate that.
There is a single knowledge which is to be converted into all this.
Sometimes obviously the best of the old generation strings are cloned into the new one, those who have or having better fitness values to make sure that you get a better offspring in the next generation.
While while we read something, when we come across something that we don't understand, probably after reading few more passages, we’ll we’ll be able to get that thing right.
We know that these many possible, so that many nodes. Okay .
What does they do?
Now this is basically moving to that state with the probability P because if you use a good heuristic function, good random number generator between zero and one it is equally probable each number is equally probable.
Okay , we in fact you can go further and get the answer but best first search basically is is the search where you use heuristic value and you just pick up the best node irrespective of what your children are and what the parent’s heuristic value is.
In most cases if if you look at those chess puzzles, you'll find W and B.
And that's the second great thing about the ACO .
For example, the network is really slow and that that prompts me to think that there has to be something malicious happening.
So, you need to increase summation even for correct answers.
So that is what you do.
It is about having some predefined primitives and predefined links to be used for representing general English statements and any other language statements.
Implicit assumptions there in the program itself.
Now what is left?
So that's what exactly next rule talks about.
So that is the scripts were quite static.
There are a lot of things possible, four three is possible, four zero is possible, zero three is possible.
I I cleverly defined the values of farmer, fox, chicken and grain.
And the disadvantage of the second player, we've already seen the previous module that the last slide of the previous module talked about the the second player will not have some chances.
There are two stories provided.
Remember ant adds a pheromone value equal to the constant value C divided by the path length.
Okay , number six which move to choose?
If you don't say so, it is assumed it is default.
And we'll find out we’ll for all possible paths, we just add two components, we’ll find minimum and then start travelling.
What is deleted?
We have everything on the left hand side.
What is the precondition for place on table A?
Best first search is about exploring this but unlike hill climbing you will just pick up the best node.
You may ask me how have I decided rule number one to be applied.
You have no time to go back.
So, this expert and CPM will will tell you such type of charts, will tell you exactly what if one task is delayed, okay , what if a task gets delayed, whether the next task will be delayed if it is a prerequisite.
Unwinding accumulates the path.
Now, that is an example of the transfer of ownership; okay , such things are represented using the primitive called ATRANS , okay .
So, what you're supposed to do is to divide the experts knowledge into knowledge chunks or knowledge segments and knowledge segments is made up of many rules.
That is not a very good idea, usually it is little forty five degrees okay is most common case.
Now that is something where you combine multiple things into one.
Now, ‘kill’ is represented using this statement.
Instead if you if you do the other way around if you if you place B on the table, again start state does not have B on the table so that is one way it is not adding anything which is good, but the second one.
Welcome back friends to the twelth module of AI in which we are going to talk about a few more search algorithms.
DFS unlike BFS do not guarantee optimal solution.
Looking at the differences, probably we will have some idea what is different in in in computer artificial neuron, in the the brain compared to the the processors and the the we’ll learn about the motivation for having the artificial neuron.
Because the problem is less structured.
Twenty-six.
That is what we're going to study in this particular module.
Then pheromone it it’s a tendency to evaporate.
Seven cities are connected to each other using direct roads.
So, that's the problem.
There is a figure nine point one in the handout as well as in the PPT which clearly visualizes what I just talked about and this is called three three two network.
So, one is the actual distance, the other is estimated distance and based on that you will figure, you will find out which path is more promising, and we'll explore that path first.
This is a more critical part than it looks at the first shot.
Now this is the value P and if our R which is which we have randomly picked up is less than P, then we allow.
To capture that essence this kind of a structure is used.
And that's where probably Deep Thought team had somebody who was a grand master, chess grandmaster, was part of it.
So, it learns to to accept G even without that.
Branching factor is number of nodes that you’ll have as a child on an average.
The job is done.
And in fact this method, though we have not yet specified how it is, so we we’ll look it later.
Hello friends! We will begin with the third module on AI .
One of the method is called Nearest Neighbour algorithm which helps in finding out the the quite optimal solution for travelling salesman problem.
For pedagogy purpose, we can do that and that has been used even by Schank in in his papers.
So, you require that coder also.
When the program acts like this, it's basically working on the instruction of the designer which is impossible for complex cases like chess .
So, I don't have much to choose from but if you look at in little more detail, if you say that if you play the first move the leftmost move, okay , we have one chance to win but that is a minimizing move.
It defines learners of two different types, one type of learners are sensors, who learn from outside and the other type of learners are intuitors, they they they they learn from within, they they conceive things, they they process things, they think over whatever is presented and learn from them.
Deletion is if you just look at this it is phi, there is nothing which is common.
It is huge .
So both ways it is possible.
So thats about simulated annealing.
Okay . Our next one is called Depth first iterative deepening.
But when we have no directed this thing it becomes half.
Okay , Not only that one, second point is that you share what you have learned.
Now Do what does Nobita do with that stick is not mentioned in the statement.
Remember why?
We'll be talking about them at the end of this module.
Now we are increasing, increase the weights associated with all non-zero inputs so that’s what we are going to do in learning process.
It just sum things up and just check for the threshold or zero value.
So, that that is important.
CD does not provide you that context.
Now, let us try to formalize whatever we have stated.
These are four prerequisites.
Not only that, you can define variables and manipulate them in multiple ways.
It will shortlist five hundred out of that.
So in MiniMax algorithm, the exploration of tree happens in the winding phase.
toh longer paths lesser the pheromone.
Okay , look at that.
And why this sparse?
In missionary cannibal Sorry, it’s milk jug problem, sorry, it’s zero, zero, zero minus ten.
okay?So the the point is, There is no point exploring the next branch.
For example, we have a solution space where we have every node describing a solution.
okay ?
What my requirement is to reach to ten.
Okay and I’ve I’ve already talked about the chess playing programs use serious heuristics and sometimes the chess playing programs use heuristics based on the opponent.
After every input we adjust weights.
So, that is important thing here.
Back For back propagation algorithm what you need is a multi-layer neuron.
So, what you have to do is to reduce the temperature as fast as possible without affecting the stableness of the result, okay , and that actually there is no formula.
Now that's fine, it's a mechanical definition of a brother, but can you define brother that way?
And that's a very, very important thing.
Because, depending on those values you can determine whether it is possible to apply that rule or not.
Not only that, you can always apply a clear idea to simplify things.
In the initial run, you may use sparse neighbourhood to grow faster.
We don't have any other measuring device and would like to have exactly two gallons of water in a four gallon water jug.
One is called Path Representation which we already have done.
It is not white and black, not only white and black, it's also the player, the player one and player two sometimes.
How this is related to GA ?
So, we are not going towards goal we're going so going away from it.
So, place on top BA is to be inversely applied to get BA on top of the table okay .
This function calls some other function.
Because again, this you probably have seen a lot of beta releases yourself.
okay Who’d , you describe the problem in complete detail as much as you can.
That means that farmer is either on one side or the other.
So, these are two important principles of simulated annealing.
Fine.
And and you can use For example, ATRANS .
The other way around, if you provide the friend’s image and the summation is less than what is expected is called negative misclassification, okay .
So, if if you want to have an X-ray, what are the ingredients?
One slanting line , one with the this one's slanting and the other one is on the other slanting and the third one is the horizontal left to right up, left to right down and horizontal.
We have already seen the min layers are where the opponent is playing and max layer is where we are playing, okay .
The other precondition is, if A equal to not Fr what does that mean the farmer is not on the the left side, okay A is on the left side .
And why it is darkened?
The first one.
And let us pick up the first rule and you can see in your handout that the rule is pretty simple, which which connects a picture producer or an actor with an act and is a double sided arrow which is used which talks about which which conveys that is a double dependency and it it uses.
The cyclic crossover is little different so I have chosen a longer to make sure you understand.
The parent one is A, C, B, D, E, F, G out of that we will copy the middle three elements B, D and E in the child.
So, the values there are there are many variables used and those values are are between minus ten to ten.
And…And many times CD attempts to get more information out of that statement.
In fact, the algorithm is pretty simple.
You know that in a given chemical structure, something which is impossible , is impossible.
So, it can always do it.
Whatever decisions that I make, I'll have to have that KE and expert sit together and they decide that. This is the structure that they need.
Now we have that initial state and final state.
6,2,0 is also a child of 3,2,3.
Not only that one very, very powerful mechanism, one very, very powerful inference that you can get out of script is that it can predict unusual events, unusual sequence of events and can see that there is something wrong. For example, ‘Jay went to watch the match.
So that is very expensive.
And again, 0,5,3 we have 2,3,3 and 3,5,0 which is again repeated.
We just assume that is the solution and test if it is a solution if it’s not, we quit.
And the deletion you know what is the deletion?
So these two things are being sent back.
The steepest ascent hill climbing, the the little different version of it, you can generate all nodes and pick up the best and and so on.
So, the every image contains some pixels which are black some pixels which are white.
But remember what we need to do is what we need to do for positively misclassified and negatively misclassified.
sneeze And there's one more thing.
Now, if you increase the summation, the value is available on on on the y axis, larger the summation, higher the value, more the value.
I saw the match, or I watched.
There is some dynamic issue in the path.
So, there is no way to represent high level context.
When the representation is confined to the very statement, now script, actually help us improve that and there is one more example which I gave in the the handout that I went to Indroda Park, which is a natural zoo in Gandhinagar with kids you assume that a lot of other things like I bought tickets, I I took my car inside and I parked my car in the in the parking zone, I took all picnic related material from my car, went inside, enjoyed watching animals and had my breakfast or whatever there, moved around, come back took the car and go back.
So that is one way and then it is quite possible that you take the entire sequence again.
Because there is a likelihood of failure.
Now there is the first one, Okay .
The time is one, the branching factor of the tree is one more.
The other interesting thing is that the strength of CD also is the weakness.
Then we’ll apply static evaluation function to each children.
‘I MTRANS match’ and ‘I INGEST ice okay They happen together.
For example, TCPIP knowledge is needed for intrusion detection, but the whole thing is available in form of RFCs , you just get that RFC and get that information.
So, now when there is a dead end the last parent will explore its right child.
The simple programs are are are pretty hard on the face of it.
Let us take a very simple example.
What we have seen in this particular module.
Now here and this is something also which we've already looked at in the previous module, the statement that we have encountered in previous module.
Now I want actually to find out path from A to again back to A considering all seven cities but the rest is not known to me.
And we what we want is we want everybody remain intact at the end of the problem and if the farmer is not around, fox may eat chicken and chicken and may eat grain.
One more is a horizontal line.
Please understand these values like fuzzy logic depends on context.
Now that yesterday is is indicated. Now you can see that it’s not a double arrow it’s a single arrow.
But then there are other preconditions.
Also, we have seen relevance of a state.
It is also used in in satellites by ISRO scientist, because again over there, there is an issue about power as well as this thing , so they innovatively used this thing .
And here is an example given on the on the slide. Dead is minus ten.
For example, when you eat something, you’re taking a solid object from outside, ingesting it or drinking something which is liquid, which you're taking in.
The neurons don’t remain their steady living, they they are constantly dying.
So, that is acceptable.
The order crossover is very similar to the earlier one but the other thing that we are going to keep the order intact. Okay .
How do How do I get one?
Then you have the middle layer in remember middle layer you have total N units.
It says that the next block is empty.
So, that is basically summation and how HI values are calculated, we have already seen that.
Is a function which is is applied to a state.
So, the next slide actually talks about talks about how you can write the rule in little more flexible, little more general way.
Whats the annealing schedule?
And you can see after arrow, we have L M one minus M, C three minus C, what does it mean?
I I can apply that thing at level one.
Apply next rule if no operator is left return with best so far.
Lot of people came out with lot of models and plenty of model that exists in literature.
okay .
So, because I I don't have complete information every time opponent plays, I’ll generate a an entire subtree as as much as big subtree as I can, and just pick up the next move every time.
Usually you look at all this information and whether see whether this statement contains some of these script headers.
But then it says ‘with a stick.’ Now, how do you represent that part ‘with a stick?’
What what is what is the pheromone value that an ant add?
So you can modify that.
So, you may look at them and let me recap what we have done in this particular module.
Sounds simple, it is.
And again the theory says that it is possible to to use a single hidden layer and a single hidden layer can do a job which multiple hidden layers can do.
Thank you.
Dhoni rides a bike.
In some cases it is not possible.
Now the earlier module we described both methods which are they are they are quite common and they are quite general in the sense that many variants of them exist in in in the real world.
We stop when there is a six ply explored.okay .
Parent node is explored again to get its next child.
Okay .
In the first module, we have looked at what AI is and what the what are the problems which AI is trying to address and so on and so forth.
Okay , one may one more example is replace a move not changed for long .
Those problems include a very simple problem called exoar .
Assume an assembly of people from multiple countries and the speaker is speaking in one typical language and there is a program called translator which what that program does is just listen to what the person is speaking and try to translate that into the language, okay .
For example, finding out right set of, now this quite interesting.
We know.
So, you may not use them but you will find them.
Physical annealing process allows the metal to cool down and reach to a stable state and it is found that the the process of cooling down has a serious impact on the the the stableness of the result and it allows some randomness in the movement.
We have seen how you can use a a vector.
So, that is a conceptualized in the lization that we see in rule number seven.
Now, we have already seen that this is something which we’d like to avoid.
It is a valid state.
ok W. B chooses obviously the player B or player two chooses minimum value of static evaluation function.
Anyway, so there we are not using them, we are only using player one and player two here.
Okay , so for one conceptualization the other conceptualization is used as an object.
Both of them cannot be one.
You placing A on the table.
By completely filling this and rest escaping here and and the eight nine and so on, you can you can read these remaining rules yourself and you can see that they are completely self-explanatory, Okay .
Consider the input coming from lot of frames, sensors and all that.
So it has to be that way.
If it is not, he cannot do it.
Based on that, there are some minute differences.
Before you have a recursive call you must provide your terminating criteria because when you make a recursive call it goes to the it it invokes one more instance and we'll continue doing it, if you have not specified a terminating criteria before.
Fingerprint recognition probably is is something that you have seen quite a lot in recent days.
So, if you reach to a state which is not acceptable or when you reach to a move which is not acceptable only because it is impossible using the move to move from one this state to this state.
Now think of the state that he he he has to look at; ceiling above the floor, there's a floor beneath, there are objects around in the in the room, chair, sofa, lights, so on .
Otherwise if you write the algorithm differently, the iterative way, is going to be very tough.
For example, in case of chess, queen has much, much higher value than a pawn.
Why?
How can you represent the same problem in multiple ways and and what are the advantages of one type of representation or the other?
If you do not use heuristics, unguided.
It says if at(pawn, black, i,j).
Previous state equal to current state minus A dot additions and union , now it is union because there may be a few things which are repeated.
But then at level one I don't get much information this the the heuristic or static evaluation function are just estimates and I go near to the goal I get better estimate.
So, that's the reason why what you need to do is to re-run the program.
So we can solve it manually and can instruct the program to do it.
You can see that Nobita INGEST because he is eating rice ‘eat’ is represented as INGEST sorry and the object is rice, double arrow as usual because it is past tense P but that is used as an instrument.
With that we will conclude this genetic algorithm module number eight.
So, there was no ontology.
Now the parent one is A, C, B, D, E, F, G Okay and now remember the child one, we have already taken the part from parent two now the rest is to be picked up from parent one we have already talked about.
Same about D and H okay only the value is eight.
I'll talk about that soon what I mean, okay . You may do that, for example, you may just pick up top five, okay , nodes in chess kind of , okay and pick up the best at the end.
In fact, one was about death of a very successful horse race horse without any apparent disease and and a spouse killing the other one because of insurance money.
Combinatorial explosion is number of options that you have.
So A, B, C, D, E, F, G is a same tours as G, F, E, D, C, B, A okay the reverse path is the same.
If he has not learned, expert expert should be able to explain him what is lacking and why and all that.
Similarly, M two plus M the the number of missionaries now we are going to have on the right hand side, must be greater than or equal to number of cannibals on the right hand side.
For example, in case number two, you might have four one three is the final state and the the earlier one also you can have two and zero or two and sorry zero and two, three and two is also possible.
The first generate and test is to find out which class the sample belongs to and then that generate and test is is to figure out what subclass that these sample belongs to.
I assumed it exists so I am not worrying about that right now.
And you can see the best first search the next figure in the the slide shows how best first search works.
One more thing that might come to your mind that is it possible for you to represent the same statement in two different ways?
We are into ninth module of AI .
We we just do addition or subtraction.
You can see that in this case, we'll have to move our king and sacrifice our queen.
You just explore your children, apply heuristic function and pick up, Okay sorry.
What does that mean?
Okay .
I have to be there at the bus stand, kind of Okay .
For example, one simple method is to cut string at a typical place.
If you start thinking like this from the ground level, you probably come out with very, very different, maybe exclusively different from this particular side and still be able to represent your statement.
And the third one is 5,3,0.
We have X zero to XN as an input.
This is again an example of an invalid move .
So, everybody understand about that system, their own role and what they expect from others, what other expects from them in a very clear terms.
It's called positional value.
How this starts?
Look at three examples given in on the slide. 8-0-0, 3-5-0, 8-0-0.
There are three examples shown on the screen.
The opponent may start the The first case, it is MiniMax start state zero and one .
Here we can say that a ticket is a prop, seat is a prop, and so on so forth.
And who is propelling it?
So, what we have to do is, the previous state equal to what current state minus all additions, additions are to be removed, whatever additions are provided they are to be removed.
Okay , let us take a simpler case of having just one one friend.
What is the value of N in the previous example?
There are a few statements like, I I just talked about Ram is in love with Sita, Ram loves Sita, Ram found Sita loving and these all statements will have same representation.
I'm I’m segregating each one at L Fr.
It starts with the start state start state at a as a root node.
We have seen that the the AI programs, one of the major obstacles in solving problems, the AI problems, is to characterize them precisely.
But it is basically not.
If it is not , what should I do?
Now, what’s tricky about this?
So, the normal generate and test is applied only when the classification is done.
So delta is decrement in the value of the objective function when you talking about a new state you see how decrement it happens.
They're called intuitors, the first type of learners are called sensors.
He learns about conveying his idea now.
So, every domain has the jargon associated with it.
So, fine.
This I am This person is recognized clearly.
So, a tolerance level is point one.
So, you need to look at the design which can provide all this.
There is no you you have nothing to choose actually.
Anyway, let us talk about why it is an excellent method of solving some very, very interesting AI problems.
So, this is a very, very critical part of the system design, the expert system design.
For example, I have A, B and C.
That is not happening here.
Again as I said, I am not going to discuss all crossover methods, we are only going to see a few useful methods which are used in TSP.
So, it just multiplies, xi wi, xi wi, x one w one, x two w two, x three w three at at this point of time I am not bothered about layers.
So, these are the three things which happen if you say place on table A, okay .
Look at the slide.
So what's the saving?
It is quite possible that you apply the same MoveGen function and what will it do?
There are a lot of other properties which makes MOP a far better solution than scripts.
Now how it is summed up?
And it is quite possible that you traverse some futile, useless states.
So we can't jump from one state to the other unless we have a legal move connecting them.
If the length is more , just terminate.
So, those and what what’s the role of an action?
Pretty complex.
And second what we want is is is is to make the program more intelligent , program to solve the problem itself, not the designer solving it and hard coding it in the program.
Can you do that by computer?
I'm talking about an average which belongs to that range.
And obviously this this clearly indicates that we need heuristic based searches. Okay .
If a an opponent has two consecutive cells occupied and the third cell is empty, is a very less value almost defeat okay .
So the child one now has E star which which we will still have to fill B, G, A star D.
So far, we have said that we provide input, we we say that this is the right output, if the program generate a wrong output we convert that, we we change weights to make sure it generates the right output.
Test if it is a solution.
What are the rules?
If it you are not going to remember it for a long period.
It can actually learn on its own, can look at names of names which it cannot understand, ask user, learn about them, place them in the database and so on, so forth.
The opponent.
Okay 5,0,3 there is one typical result is again 8,0,0 which again we’ll not explore further because it is a cycle.
So here also we are doing it.
If it if it is phi acceptable, if it is not, not acceptable.
So, I'll pick up that child, the third one, if I'm doing it.
Dense neighbourhood gives you more number of nodes.
And you can see that at the end we what we have is four four zero that means four gallons of milk in in the eight gallon jug. okay .
A state space representation is about storing information in a form that there is something called an initial state, the problem’s state in the beginning , when the problem commences the problem is in the initial state.
So, everything that is important is actually listed.
The okay , you can see that when Ram killed Ravan, Sita was happy.
X is the amount of milk in jug the eight gallon jug.
okay so you you use multiple agents but eventually it’ll converge to a single path which is the best path.
But that is quite acceptable.
E F G H is not six twelve or four.
If you know about that letter you may replace ‘do.’
We’ve already seen that it is possible to represent the problem using State-space.
And that’s the reason why we’re not going to discuss much about this.
That's great.
Because, his opponent will want to play.
In fact, it it it allows you to pick up the best child, not only that irrespective of the parents value.
In in case where backtracking is impossible, for example, chess.
So, these are this is a new state.
So, there is a P on on top of the double arrow.
The terminating criteria is tested by calling a function call over.
Object case relationship and the Sachin and and ATRANS that relationship double arrow - P.
But then if you if you bond.
Relevant and non-relevant actions.
In first thing is called winding phase.
Now if you remember our best first search and all that we we used something similar.
So once they are copied as it is, you have complete child A.
We have already seen that.
The other ant also starts spraying the pheromone along the same path and it'll add to the the amount of pheromone and what does that mean?
But the other yes, an an important here is representation of the state, the mental state - sad and happy.
Why?
So, you can see.
What about the second one?
It's a pretty trivial using a vector.
Now what we do is just we just check if the first sequence is a solution, second sequence is a solution, third sequence is a solution and so on, so forth.
Traveling salesman problem for example, when we talk about, if you want to get the tour which is optimal we may start with a random tour A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H or something here A, B, C, D, E, F are are are cities.
Now on the other side, you can see that not D and not C is about the other side okay .
Well anyway, there is one excellent expert system which was known as Dendral, designed to use generate and test.
Okay , let me even talk about, the pheromone value is the length is is inversely proportional to length.
okay So, when the terminating criteria is reached you have to come back.
Begins with zero but then it'll increment every time. So, when you get back you know where I am okay so if somebody is already told us that after a sufficient depth you'll have to come back maybe a terminating criteria.
With that we’ll come to an end of this particular module.
Why?
In fact, there are more complex problems than chess.
There are a lot of other complexities.
It is not very good.
So, that neural network program could do it.
If you want the the answer, the solution, in minimum number of steps from the the root node or the initial state, BFS is the best solution.
okay , There are a lot of things which happen.
If you if you look at the search process that is that is described earlier you move in this direction and this direction and this direction you may feel that it’s quite jittery.
For example, I've started from A and I want to reach to Z.
You require a tester who is going to test the system, who is going to write test cases and going to run once the system is developed.
Again opponent.
Progression is relevant to our goal state if some part of the resultant state is in the goal state and removed part must not be in the goal state okay .
We have looked at many other things in past, we talked about MiniMax layers, we talked about heuristic function which is called static evolution function, we've also seen that a game tree has expanded to the maximum possible level, static evolution function is applied at the leaf node, is backed up and based on which you'll decide the next node to choose.
That throwing stone is used as an instrument to to get this the other thing done.
what is ‘Do’?
So, when I say I'm throwing a stone, actually that involves more than one primitives.
See I started with A, , the the element correspond to A and parent two is D, the the same D appears at position number four in this case, so D at position four is copied, Okay , here.
Think of it.
Suppose if you have a company where there are thousands of employees working and you would like to retain them.
Okay , I could actually have written that as well.
Anyway, so that is one thing which we'll have to work on.
Information characteristics what is also very important because you are going to design your class based on that, okay .
So, that is representation as the E okay Effect link. So, you can see that.
It's very strict form actually you can't have any kind of link that you want, you can't have can't have any type of node and again, allowed links and allowed nodes are always fixed.
okay , The program should interact with patient as if the program itself is a doctor.
First, we would like to win as long as possible.
And the value, the heuristic value that that path that move enable says how good or bad that thing is.
There is a formula you just apply if the heuristic function give you exact measure of how far the goal node is, you don’t need to do.
We have already seen that even classified, correctly classified inputs are also learning, in case of sigmoid.
So, we find out objective function value of a new state minus the objective function value of the current state.
You may think why it is done that way?
That's the path.
We don't really know.
It is impossible because everything is happening in real time.
So, place on top of B is better, more relevant then place on top of a CD because you will get a better state okay .
Okay .
So, the terminating criteria comes here.
For example, I have three inputs A, I and H and I have I am showing three different images of A but two images of one each of I and H.
That value is, we have assumed that value is four.
So that that heuristic can help you finding better paths before and three more branches of search tree and obviously you will be able to gain a lot in terms of the search time.
Designing problem logic, conventional diagrams are used in many cases and they are absolutely fine.
So, the first thing that they wanted to do is is to have a neuron which they call artificial neuron.
That's the other thing.
And we have seen that is quite good.
So simulated annealing is is is a better method compared to hill climbing but anyway it is also a a superset of hill climbing.
If I have N it is thirty-five raised to N number of moves I'll have to apply, evaluate them for that particular case for a single move every time .
The first part how to write this function actually depends on the domain .
Similarly, when you have negative misclassification it is the images of your friend and it is not saying yes, then we will have to increase the amount of summation and again, anything multiplied by zero is not contributing, so will only increase .
Now, the question is whether it can learn or not that is one thing, but it also is theoretically it is possible that it can learn.
The next slide talks about the shape of the square function.
So, why we are talking about Unguided Search Methods too?
That is quite different than other algorithms.
So, when you design these forms and reports, let the normal user read and understand what it is.
You may ask me, is it a good move?
The root node is 8,0,0 or initial node. Now what we do now is we apply all possible rules and generate all possible states which can be generated from eight in the next level.
The algorithm is simple.
So, that is a difference, okay .
And if it is four four plies one four four zero zero zero in case of twenty, seven seven one seven five zero in case of thirty five for five plies you can see is going way beyond .
For all source and destination you will be able to get this.
We are moving back, we're talking about moving back, but basically, we are going to solve the problem in a forward direction only .
What are the expectations?
Think of it.
As I said, researchers tried to mimic brain.
So I'm not going to play C.
That is done.
So, state change is inflicted by that acting, okay .
Now that is a very hard problem very hard solution but that's the best solution if you can get.
Okay , this is again different than the hill climbing because if this were hill climbing, one cannot be explored, it has lesser value than two.
And here one more interesting thing about travelling salesman problem is we can we can actually choose a Sparse neighbourhood or dense neighbourhood function.
Earlier we used to write the value of the variable the variable itself.
What's the second one?
Just take the case of branching factor twenty .
So, I’m I'm not going to talk in detail about But the idea is to have user’s input and other expert’s input and get the system better over the period of time, provide corrections to the knowledge base and sometimes the primary expert himself.
B is one fifty and C is one fifty.
Now you pick up on A table and you realize that it is already achieved.
Now this is little more tricky .
So,and and if I get one as thirty-four the other one is twenty-two my lower amount reduces to twenty-two.
So, that was all three possible cases in Tic Tac Toe which is also the same in chess.
So if two is explored we get minus three, minus two and one .
Answer is MBUILD ING something, in a response to a question and you again after that once that is done, you also use MTRANS from that mind to the mouth, Okay , so that that is done in fact, answer is represented like that, Okay .
So this is also very, very critical phase.
It cannot understand because it has the ability to understand Gary Kasparov’s moves but it cannot understand this move.
And it is based on the idea of how life forms persist.
We have looked at something called generate and test.
The other thing how many samples do I need?
What about fox, chicken and grain all three of them on one side?
The rest is an estimate, okay .
Yes, it was part of the start state that is deleted.
If they are similar, we don't need to move around start space is the goal state.
You won't find number of cannibals more than number of missionaries.
Repeated or goal is not explored further.
If we call A as an action and addition a and deletion are functions, toh what we can do it with our methods or so we say that A A dot addition, the action A adds whatever it adds okay it’s called A dot addition and we take an intersection with goals state, we call it GS .
But here usually a simpler method is picked up, you apply fitness function and out of twenty select five.
Branch and bound is for other problems as well.
And in some cases, they’re applied in a hybrid way.
We have already seen how specific and general move can be written.
If you have arranged them in some other fashion and only other fashion possible is on BA before and on A table next, like this the other case.
So when you find statement talking about something abnormal which is not mentioned in the script, probably the results are not there.
So, that is called complete network.
Tau is the value of pheromone equal to T T tau T the earlier one multiplied by one minus rho okay .
The problem state.
Okay , let let us look at this thing in in a little more classic way.
In a way that in the initial run you you allow that okay some some move to a bad state from a current state is allowed.
It's distinct path is tour covering all cities.
And if it recognizes it is fine, if does not recognize you will have to change those weights, okay .
Basically, it is represented by Propel is physically physical force and also PTRANS, okay .
When we say we dined there that we we went into that, we we have looked at the menu, we ordered something, we ate those things. And there are waiters who who who who delivers those things to us, serve those things to us and we paid the bills obviously and then left.
Okay , it's time.
So far only three guys were involved - the user, knowledge engineer, and expert.
But we assume that thing.
So, classification can be only one, correct classification, right image, friend’s image is friend’s, non-friend’s is non-friend, great .
And then there is a recipient case relationship , where I is it's coming from eyes, the information is coming from eyes and going to CP , when I'm watching a match, that information is going inside my mind so that's what is done.
The problem is about a farmer, fox, chicken and the grain finding themselves on the one side of the river and they have to move on the other side.
That is not going to work.
So the beauty of having a hidden layer is that it can figure out the features from the input and based on those features, the output unit can learn to become active or inactive.
We say that at R Fr which is very clear.
So, this is what we are we are supposed to do.
There's no missionary actually.
That is what we like we would like to prevent the opponent to win okay .
So, if you if you do it for a very large time, you probably run out of time.
So, you ask them and you learn.
For example, animate objects like Sachin and sometimes even natural forces can also be used in CD as the actors, Okay .
You have to have prerequisites, you have to have variables.
Minus one is the best node right now , Okay .
There's no difference just named as objective function.
sorry I cannot talk about right now, if you if you look at the mathematical background of some algorithms like Back propagation, you probably will be able to understand why differentiation is a must.
Because it's quite worse.
The There is some similarity.
So, that’s precisely the the theme of this particular module.
When they are they are successful in finding it.
Now, one interesting rule that comes next is that sometimes the act inflicts the state change.
So, that's kind or or health equals to five then he is happy, health health equals to ten then he is ecstatic , okay , kind of representation that is possible using CD .
So simple?
You can see that should not because he has gone but then he heard about the the demise of his grandfather and he has come back.
in fact generation of solutions one after the other and and doing it in a way that humans and other spaces do in a way that eventually what you get are better solutions search.
H While C has three children, H is seven, I is minus nine and J is five.
Pick up the start node and make it current, Okay , the start node and take up all nodes, and store them in the sorted order of heuristic value.
One more thing is that once this is done, they they look at this and understand whether problem solution should not go in wrong direction.
I’ve already talked about the need.
An in fact if if you have read about something called Felder-Silverman model, if you're a teacher probably, you have heard about that Felder-Silverman model and and Myers-Briggs model, that was little older.
Okay that causal relationship because this thing has causal relationship, you can conclude something which was not explicitly mentioned in the the statement, okay .
Because these scenes are directly introduced into the the target representation when that statement is encountered.
You probably have heard about Google car, that is self-driving car.
If it is less, i'll I am not going to play that move. I only play P.
Every city is directly connected with every other city, so we have lot of paths,
Now, in true sense such things are not acceptable.
I've already talked about two cases chess and robot domain and even car automated car domain where this is just impossible .
So, they’ll also test their knowledge and this is a very, very useful, important learning experience.
It’s it’s again is something that you cannot explain.
Think of it
it is quite possible that we may not write one rule without which we cannot solve the problem.
Changes genes drastically but provides an escape route.
So, people are working on it, but there is no solution yet.
Okay . A process called random walk is is about its very similar to our generate and test.
Its comparatively much simpler to represent .
And it has few places to go but almost all places are occupied.
I'm I do not have any copy right now I do not have anything to begin with.
That is quite possible in case of expert system.
So, this associative search is also something where human brains are far better compared to us the computers.
Now, the statement does not indicate that store but the If you have an ontology, probably you can have that.
We have looked at a problem called Three Four Gallon Water Jug problem and Eight Five Three Gallon Milk Jug problem where we've shown how why they they those problems can be represented using state space and so on so forth.
Number of nodes from a given node, Okay and average number is higher.
Usually this value is between minus ten and ten, so that value will give you the the ranking of or the merit of every state that you have at your disposal and you can choose the best one.
Now I'm I’m using hurt as hurt only.
If the root node is reached and no further children to be explored, the search process ends there unsuccessfully.
And also, it is it indicates that the hostage’s health which was earlier other than minus ten becomes ten because he's dead now.
The other one is called Order crossover.
We can we are looking at a cricket match and you see a side face of a friend and you recognize him.
Ram Ram has done something to Ravan.
We don't have programs which can play many other games , but still we have programs which can play chess.
You can see that it is being repeated yet again but now for two levels. Okay .
In chess, it is possible to have a situation where you cannot proceed further, there is no way to proceed further.
What does it mean?
This is rule one which talks about a very simple relation between PP and ACT , okay .
KE , however good KE is, he is not that knowledgeable.
Feed forward means, the inputs are flowing in the forward direction.
We are not going to discuss many things about GA and I have I have given one or two references at the end of this chapter and end of this module.
They start travelling in random directions.
So, those numbers, the order also is not going to be similar in in other if you refer to some other material.
Now you talk about two different scripts in this particular statement - watching a match and coming back by bus.
So obviously we need to have unexplored nodes.
P is the probability.
That is the addition that was not there that was not true before now it becomes true so that is an additional thing.
Okay , the heuristic search process.
And I'm I’m talking about a very simple case.
So, the the the reasoning that they had is buried inside their that thing.
We are not going to discuss all of them.
Thank you.
How do you know that this is a valid state?
This brain is very different than computer the computer processor and now we’ll be discussing about the differences between these two.
One more line, one more hidden unit learn to become active and it is it is right it’s it’s it’s going down from right to left to right.
which I where the solution can be found is pretty useful. And there is something, I call Hierarchical Generate and Test.
M one C one is number of missionaries and number of cannibals and obviously indicates and, R indicates right , the right side.
Then we apply the first rule which makes it four, so this state is good so we move to four .
So, here, again it’s called direction.
Think of it.
okay You can see that both examples or both conceptualizations.
Quite interesting.
But then we have explored enough number of plies.
In fact, not only that is better to represent, it is also better to code and run faster .
So that is called perturbation search, Okay , unlike the constructive search that we have seen so far.
Okay .
So that dependency is one way.
So what do they do?
So it's better if you explore everything together and in such a case, beams search is one of the best solutions.
A same is the case with three A.
The transfer about something where the mind is involved.
Nine into nine matrix and I want to recognize A.
For two reasons.
With that we’ll conclude this particular module.
So, it’s not all that wasteful, Okay .
Now remember, brain uses a stimuli, some information that is coming in, plus weight, okay .
So, when but it's basically a leaf node, okay though we say that we'll go out five plies depth.
Now we are, when a node which is explored is already already explored before we’ll not explore it further for obvious reasons.
The first node is minus five, not very good.
In fact nearest neighbor is quite interesting.
For example, Sachin’s elbow okay .
That's used as a placeholder.
My table drawer is the third.
One , very simple method is to use normal way of using binary neuron as a single digit.
What you get are are six-seven children and you apply that that fitness function, the the value, the distance value.
Now, please understand the action is applied like this so previous to new.
So, this is an example of how addition or deletion can be done.
MiniMax algorithm is one of the oldest algorithms of game playing.
You can see that the representation Sachin and PTRANS.
And the first call of this algorithm will take the starting state.
So, if the X is greater than or equal to three, so here we have more amount of milk.
Second also connects to first second and third and so on.
But, while going through it at some point or on the other we realize that we we quite accurate, we're very good, we can come back and for which, we have written a function call over.
Because at leaf node we have the most this heuristic function or static evaluation functions are what?
So, in fact, in this case Sachin and ATRANS dependent on each other.
And that's the fact.
Okay . Why sparse neighbourhood is to be chosen?
We decide what we want to achieve.
One slanting line like this, the other slanting line like this.
And what we want in the end state is C is resting on D and B is resting on A this is what I want.
But then, such when you keep question marks, there are encounter later statements.
An example is again shown with the same one and let us use goal stack planning.
So, what we need is an static evaluation function.
How can the move assume that value?
We have seen that AI is about solving difficult problem and GA is one great way of solving difficult problems.
First requirement is that the solution path should not contain any cycles.
You have a long term maintenance plan, you decide that thing and write that thing down.
Try to see and try to understand.
That’s called State Space.
The other example, ‘terrorists shot hostage’.
Thank you.
So, let us start talking about them. The first step here is prototype construction and conceptualization.
The row which we discussed, in fact we can assume it to be part of summation, is again very simple, what we are doing is x one w one plus x two w two x three w three and so on.
So in the beginning it'll be this, later on it will be the other one and if the opponent starts playing, in chess it is possible that we may not start.
So, L is this and R is exactly opposite to this and that is very important.
Next action, third action, fourth action.
will initialize the bast with whatever minimum value.
Is a repeat node or dead end we’ll try the right, Okay .
and in in in making sure that the enemy does not, the the prey does not get the the hint of their moving, so that they are on prowl.
I'm actually I have cheated because I've already solved that problem and I know that this is how the problem is going to be solved.
So, that is possible.
If I have three consecutive cells occupied state is one ten.
They are able to solve some problems, unsolvable for years.
You can see that this three A's which are shown here are quite different to each other.
Current state is defined as free A on AB on BC on CD and on D table okay .
The What are those types?
You may not be able to solve in one using one combination, you may be able to solve using other combination that also is possible sometimes.
Six two out of sixteen but there is a possibility that there is twenty and then you choose two.
You continue doing that eventually what you get a better solution set hopefully.
First , if you learn about Unguided Search Methods, you can always improve them by providing heuristics.
Jay stayed in a queue for an hour or so got bored and returned back home.’
Props are the objects involved in the script.
So, I'm not here to discuss object oriented programming.
I would better evaluate this position of the state in little more detail, a little more elaborated fashion.
So that’s the first requirement.
So, for that purpose, we are keeping that placeholder here.
Reading is about transforming the MTRANS information from for example, I'm I’m reading a newspaper.
But here that part is not important the part important here is bike.
Let me tell you it is quite possible that if a novice, a player is playing against Deep Blue and play a very stupid move, the Deep Blue will will get confused that what is happening.
M one M are substracted.
There's no way you can judge when you cannot judge they are called fleeting scripts and the the programmers solution to this problem is you just keep a pointer.
The job is done.
No.
Expert learns about his own role.
That that is possible.
I can move to three,five,zero and I move I can move to three,two,three, Okay .
I’ll have eight eight into eight matrix and provide positions of the pieces on the board which which in turn is the representation of a chessboard.
But that is not going to be the case in most complicated problems.
In this module we have what we have done?
In certain cases like this value of pawn maybe more than a queen.
For example, there is an obstacle which is placed.
So, that is one way of showing, but then how many such moves can you write for the chess?
So, a person also involved from that angle.
The other case we are placing B on top of table.
Okay , so you provide those employees, twenty, thirty employees and their fifty odd images of each one of them is fed into the system.
So that's what I mean by legal moves.
So I'm skipping and I'm I'm pruning all those branches, okay .
We have seen depth-first search where we explore all nodes from a root node and try to see if it's the solution.
Okay , there is something called steepest ascent hill climbing, which is a little different than the hill climbing, Okay .
Okay , so let us see what heuristic search methods are.
Let us see why we are discussing about GAs .
For example, when I'm here to detect intrusion, I should not waste my time finding out differentiating between different attacks.
Now, in travelling salesman problem you have cities, they are connected and those connections we we call them segments.
so point is the only better spaces, only better individuals are likely to survive.
One, the heuristic value of this .
Now that precondition, the the actions precondition, the state's precondition should also be there.
Heuristic value is not an exact answer and that’s why it it has to be that way.
So, for example, the input layer, we have five neurons - one two three four five.
The statement does not give you from where he started.
Now, you can use what we have studied, but looking at the figure itself yes, okay .
Third unit will learn to become active and the horizontal line is.
In some cases, player and opponent or something, okay .
The solution is that you try something else .
So, this is the other rule and the last rule.
These rules that I talked about thirteen fourteen rules.
And what it comes out with, is the value, Okay , how good or bad but ten, minus ten to ten in conventional way but you can design your own way.
There are two outgoing possible paths.
For looking at that important characteristics of moving around in state space, we have taken one more rather two more examples here in this particular module.
And on the right hand side Fr, fx, ch and grain.
The other case where you've already won or lost.
Delta E is a difference between the previous and the current state or the current state and the next state that we are trying to explore. Okay .
okay , If In most cases, we do it that way only.
One is winning.
So we start from one, the initial state we move across the the state space and we’ll reach to the final state. deep breath .
Not BPNN is not used a little modified algorithm is used there.
You may be surprised.
The next one is called sigmoid.
When you place X at the left top is not very good because I'm not going to achieve anything on that column it is possible to have on the right the top most row but it is not.
Okay So, we are considering L to be six, then all three cases are are possible to be provided, Okay .
In simulated annealing, you're allowed to choose a little less optimal path sometimes.
So in case number one, now it once it is backed up the next slide looks shows that.
And if you want to get one you will have to get the summation should be positive infinity, which is very hard, almost impossible to get.
So, if you feel that it is not very good about CD , it is actually the problem with the language and not CD .
In which situation I I ask the user or the patient to do that and how many times I'm successful in my assumption?
So, prototype will give you an idea how the final system would look like and and prototype can be very, very simple, proto en cal be as good as the final system.
SEF is a Static Evolution Function is many a times is not a single entity.
That makes it an important cutoff here and this this happens at maximizing layer.
In fact, I've just given you an idea about this.
Albino for example, or having the heart on the right side or something like that.
It tests whether you are fit.
One major challenge that we have stressed is to choose a move.
Rule number twelve, okay .
Y was free, now Y is not free okay .
Okay , that that indicates that thing you can see that the recipient of that is is LA.
They they are dependent on each other and that is being used as an instrument.
At this point of time we have not assigned any status to it, whether it is win leading to a win leading to loss or leading to draw.
What is the solution?
Unguided search methods does not use heuristic.
So, that also is very, very important role of a concept in CD .
With that, we'll come to a close.
The only difference is the the boat is on the right hand side and we are moving from right to left.
What the requirement is, that at no point of time you can have number of cannibals more than number of missionaries on on on any bank of the river.
So, that is what it is doing and researchers are looking at nature for inspiration and there are many examples like ant colony optimization, and what they learned how ants find shortest path to their food source, they devise algorithm capable of working with small components like ants, they call agents, and which is very, very low intelligent intelligence level agent with less memory, less power.
See, the first, now we what we are doing is, we are we are taking the same example, 8-5-3- gallon water jug.
And also the detailed this thing description of script probably will have scoreboards and many other things, the screens and so on so forth.
It might contain number of variables, it might contain number of conditions.
Sometimes it is possible that a static node is here, the ending node is quite far and the surrounding nodes there are plenty of surrounding nodes in a near that thing .
While watching match, I ate ice cream.
There are other ways of doing it.
The amount of pheromone obviously is more on this.
With that we’ll come to an end of this module.
Number of pieces their respective rating, for example, Queen is rated much higher than others and King is rated much, much higher than everybody else so on so forth.
So , it is basically hill climbing but with little randomness.
Okay .
Okay there are a lot of other prerequisites that the match you must be at the same place where match is happening and so on and so forth which I’ve not talked about.
Now support planning requires you to like when you roll out the expert system, people take time to get used to it and they face more problems than conventional systems because these are different types of systems.
But when KE observes the expert, he’ll learn a lot about that.
So, that doesn't happen in conventional systems, but it does here.
And collection of all valid states is called a state space .
so opponent will not choose that.
Our queen is captured.
Now, this is little different than hill climbing, a little better than hill climbing in some sense.
It is not.
And we want to an estimate A, B, C, D, E, F, G. Now E, F, G, you just calculate that using the simple heuristic that I talked about, that table and find out.
Now, that's not the case here.
The problem with this method is that it is pretty expensive in terms of memory.
Now that is little different function.
Let me tell you there is no theoretical guarantee of this process.
So total sixteen actually.
Here also build solutions.
It is not so.
Boat can carry maximum two.
you just get five best solutions and then then mingle them in a way that you get twenty better solutions and then again pick up five, and so and so forth.
Now, it is quite possible that Abdul is a person who is looking for a job and Rajan is a placement consultant or he's a smuggler and Rajan Rajan is a smuggler and Abdul is good at motorboats and so on so forth.
So that is called generate offspring from random current of this thing .
So, I don't need to go further.
L okay , the next one is N and D.
So, you what you can do is now earlier we were talking about pouring milk in in three gallon water jug.
If the node is a goal node, it quits.
Okay , so that is what best first search is.
You can see rule number nine is applied, then four, then eleven, then one, then nine again and then two and eleven.
So let us first of all try or talk about one of the simplest requirements.
Unwinding start in the last function, in the chain and then comes back.
The first representation.
Here in unlike hill climbing, we allow a bad state.
For example, I say that there was a movie where Shahrukh Khan, Deepika was there, and that parsi actor also was there.
That addition is to be removed then it gets this one.
We don't need to do it.
The new state is now free B okay because you have placed A on the table so that on BA on AB is gone.
So, in in this case the first two level, the second level, the third level, first level, the third level and the fifth level and so on I'll be invoking MiniMax algorithm.
And it is so you can see minus one you explored where one is three, other one is four.
okay so on and till the last one and remember, total values are M okay .
So, in in that case you can see that this place on table A is relevant.
So, won't prepare that dinner Okay .
So you'll have to figure out which position is better over the other and give marks accordingly so the the value accordingly.
I what I do is I pick up a root node, explore all children of it, next level explore all children of those children and so and so forth that is the Breadth-first search.
And if you if you remember the the thing that we have discussed, the interface of an expert system also quite different than conventional systems.
The solution could have gone in different direction, pick up the fourth step.
but the idea is really good, but still it is criticized.
So, that that is possible.
The first one is project planning.
Same three, zero, two, four, four and six.
Okay .
So if you're trying all possible alternatives, you can make the decision.
And the components are very simple design, obviously, because it doesn't do much - spraying pheromone, calculating value of pheromone and deciding.
Okay , so we’ll be talking about them.
Remember nearest neighbor also was a very good algorithm.
Here, why it is called partially mapped crossover?
It’ll give you a good solution, but not optimal solution. Branch and bound on the other hand will give you yes, optimal solution.
We know that the same parent, same city cannot be revisited, so we are ignoring them, we are cutting them off. Okay .
The issue is, that if you run the program again it’ll pick up some other random point and start travelling towards goal state again.
One is ant colony optimization, the other one is called branch and bound and the third one that we are going to look at is called refinement search.
For example, when your king is under attack, or when there is a fork, possibility of fork.
What does that mean?
Here you do one more thing.
if not we’ll pick up the third sequence and so on, so forth.
We start from A then explore and okay what are the trees, what are the cities possible to be reached?
So that is the third rule.
So, both things are used.
Because there are lot of people saying one thing, lot of other researchers saying absolutely the other, Okay .
Look at what it returns.
So, multiple statements having Ram loves Sita, Ram found Sita loving and so on so forth can be represented using a single statement.
A on table is added and because A is resting on B, okay A is resting on B, B B becomes free.
For example, a KE would say that what are the decisions that you make.
So, because we allow the bad state you need to have this best so far.
So that and number of cannibals also are reduced.
When there are no possibility of applying any rules, we can’t move further.
So, for example, ‘Sachin took a taxi to reach Boriwali’ or ‘Sachin reached Boriwali by taxi’ or ‘Sachin picked up a cab to Boriwali’.
So total amount of milk is less than 5 gallons.
The simplest of hill climbing you don’t do that.
What I can do is I can use a an action called place on top or place on table and use that and once I do that the prerequisite is done.
In in case of heuristic, value being more in in in the later cases its called hill climbing.
Solution is about moving across state space.
But we choose rule number one .
If you if you get that right, yes everything else becomes easy but unless you get that it’s it’s it's pretty hard.
The first case is one, the second case is one.
So when you talk about entry conditions, they are conditions that must be satisfied for invocation of that state.
The third step obviously goes ahead and calls the MiniMax for its children.
So, this expert system, while you’re designing knowledge representation process, you are not going to store the knowledge in different forms, please understand.
So, the M two, remember the original number of missionaries on the right hand side were M two.
So that what does that mean?
Earlier case was different, okay .
Now, this is something which is heuristic.
So that pheromone value is based on the distance also.
In case number one, it is impossible to to do something like that in in the milk jug problem.
So I will have E here in child one at place number one, Okay .
So, this is exactly what I have on the right side.
That's the power and that's the usefulness of beam search because here you don't have time to go back.
Okay , this is the current state and we say minus on CD that is on CD is place on top additions okay that is the only addition that we have.
The next slide talks about the same.
Probably some of you may not be able to read and understand the third representation better than the second one.
Single point crossover is not possible here. Okay .
Two.
And how have I done it?
The output units will be five or six.
We cannot proceed further.
So once you get the right tour, the job is done.
But then there are two issues.
There are four components in the start state four components in the goal state but then two of them C on top of D and D on top of table is already achieved in the final state.
How the right reason from the statement can only be derived if you learn about Abdul’s plans and his goals and all that.
How do you decide that this user this user is to be blocked?
Now, this is an important advantage of escaping from local minima.
If this value is better, make this a current state and best so far is new state.
Okay
With that we’ll conclude.
Now this is comparatively much more readable .
So over might return, come back when we reach the six ply.
One particular student implemented this to shortlist a resume in his company there are five thousand odd resumes coming in daily and what they need are bunch of experts who could look at those resumes and and filter people whom they can interview and it’s a expensive process.
It it what what the heuristic function take as an input?
Now this is a cycle .
This is a move .
We are going to define these are the tasks and these are the tasks which and this is the order for this task.
Say, cannot move.
So, you you use one heuristic function for example, you use one heuristic function which uses value four for parent and three and two for children.
So the child one remember, is going to pick up the part from parent two so B, G, A parent two, middle part is copied into child one.
Okay , so in the child.
They say that, it is impossible for such a network to even differentiate between the values which are exoar .
A human brain can easily do it, can deal with this incomplete fuzzy things and so and so forth, but conventional computer programs couldn’t do it.
Prototype construction begins with knowledge acquisition.
We have one more state which is called a final state.
Acceptable! And number of missionaries and number of cannibals on either side of the river.
Nothing bad about, nothing wrong about that.
You know such programs were just impossible a few years back.
In some other cases people use minus one to one where any real value between minus one to one is acceptable. In our case minus ten to ten usually integer values are acceptable other values are not acceptable.
And that is the reason why this depth-first iterative deepening is is used with chess.
I'm exploring one branch and I may also be exploring one more branch.
Remember NodeInfo is a structure which we are going to define later.
And it is quite good.
I just choose six,zero,two Okay .
Now you can see that it is not as straightforward as the previous case but it’s still be able to solve because we have picked up a very trivial, very simple, very easy problem to solve.
So, there are some issues with CD and next module we’ll be talking about an extension which Schank himself proposed called scripts which which which actually removes one of the problems with CD but then there are other problems.
Because, experts will have to look at all those resumes.
We are not going to discuss that thing right now.
It shows that J equal to zero to N.
So, Ram is doing something.
What we have seen in this module?
The point is all these things are assumed to be part of it and script is something which which represents this expectancy driven scenario Okay .
Multi layer module means that network contains more than one module, more than one layer, okay .
Now, I I want in in the final state C is on the table.
It says that on the left hand side, M one minus some M value, number of missionaries are there and C three minus C cannibals are there and R M two plus M.
So, here you can see that C is resting on top of D and B is resting on top of A in in case of a goal state and there are two possibilities, there's do two things that you can do you can place B on the table or you can place C on the table and you chose to do the first the second one placing C on the table.
Okay It’s basically a recursive algorithm.
You can, but then when you write rules, how you define a state space ?
We have already seen in in a typical case of depth bound depth-first search where the depth is just one is called depth depth-first iterative deepening search.
The actor acting on that object.
How the pheromone values are?
So whenever there is no node to explore you cannot go further and there is no end, there is no this thing road ahead.
Now let us look at the next level.
But even in this case, how many moves that we can write is going to be substantial.
So we’ll not choose components which does not have much of an effect.
Will be discussing about this in more depth in the next module.
So you can look at that and decide.
Suppose if you are interested and this is a real world example, suppose you want to write a password cracker and what you are doing is you’re just checking each each password.
Basically temperature describes or determines the amount of bad moves to be allowed, okay .
And again, they may not be the same in in all cases, okay .
why I've got this much of salary?
But this is a basic primitive thing that you must understand.
In fact, best first search you have three different types of nodes.
So, this is the strategy and based on that we’ll define heuristics and based on these heuristics, the static evaluation function characteristics, we’ll decide the value of a state and you can see these are multiple there are multiple components and even with such a simple case there are more than one five-six components for the heuristic value.
Okay , breath is again taking air in.
Okay , let us start talking about the the abstract, the first primitive, okay .
In fact , you can see that this is the initial state while this is the final state .
Best first, remember the word best first means that we’re only exploring best nodes , Okay .
So better thing is choose the function on demand.
Now, you may be surprised why the first cycle is repeated again.
The difference is not much.
Let us see what that is.
First, how to write this function?
So the algorithm , the back-propagation algorithm is all about processing like this.
We’d begin with a state with heuristic value minus three.
How will I represent a move ?
You are able to work in a in with a partial information.
There is some similarity with simulated annealing as well.
They generate solutions,
Suppose I am going to sit with somebody who is going to who is an expert of intrusion, he'll start talking about everything that's happening intrusion and I'll have to learn and one of the very, very important outcome is to note down the jargon used in.
We need to have some strategy to move around in state space and there are some characteristics of that strategy also.
Okay
In In conventional methods what we do is, you pick up a solution state, look at the heuristic value and then try move to some other solution space with solution state which is better.
Because it is past tense.
It is two way dependency.
If you want to write a general purpose chess player, it would be very difficult because here the search strategies and heuristic functions are specifically designed to address this guy, Gary Kasparov.
Every road is is possible to travel in both directions, okay that’s a reverse path is the same path.
So, it is A to Z that means twenty six, okay .
So, there are two components and we can pick up the shortest tour based on addition of this two components, okay .
In In case here as well ACO as I said it is will ant will not always use the path with highest pheromone value but the probability is higher okay .
A MiniMax algorithm works like that and we are going to look at the algorithm the very algorithm in this particular module.
You can see that it is not part of the goal state in So, both conditions are satisfied.
Okay so, that's the only difference, otherwise it's it’s the same okay .
‘Forget’ is exactly opposite to it, something which was part of the long term memory is gone out, hear, tell, okay and so on, so forth.
So this is how you get the child one.
Again you can see that is quite similar to the state that we have seen before.
So, W and B are not preferred in by many authors.
So, let me again brief.
As I said the GA is not the usual content for AI this thing .
Call is made when you reach to the final this thing and then unwinding phase starts.
We cannot because this this particular node has lesser heuristic value.
Okay , you can see P indicating past tense, Okay .
And then there are others also.
So those Constraint Satisfaction part uses that test, so it is generating and testing them.
So, the first layer of weight is called W one, the second layer of weight is called W two.
They plan that way.
In the middle part, you you should try to use as many M as possible, which is legally allowed.
That's one reason.
How it is doing we will see.
Here also T well decide T suppose for example, we are solving a problem and then we use one annealing schedule with T value is reducing with one and then we'll use with one typical way of reduction weíll use some other way and so on and we'll find out which works better for that problem and we'll use that okay .
So, technically it is sound enough.
It’s a little different than the normal general script.
And there are cases which which requires more for example, more elaborate representation.
So, A or E one of them must be zero because farmer will use one .
But is it so that the script is not relevant?
Action is described by this primitive and many times it is called ACT or action.
So, this is what it does.
So, again, three-prong structure is used.
Think of chess you will we’ll not be able to do that, but for these trivial cases you can actually do it.
We have also seen goal state planning where it solves everything at the problem component by component and then every component once every component is solved, it’ll check for the final that thing and if it is solved, it is so.
And H appears at position the last but one in parent one, so it is copied there in the child one.
How do we know?
We have an initial state, we have a final state, we need to move around around in the state space and that is what we call a search, Okay . A method.
You have minus three, then minus five, minus two and three are the children.
So, this is what it it should do.
So from every node, every city you have a distance to every other city.
So, if you have six units you can have total sixty four possible output.
It is pretty simple and can also be be used in embedded devices, IoT devices and many other devices, which which doesn’t have the the power or computation power or memory to process all all these. Okay .
So but you can see that the the the rule description D and three prong structure with one source the other one destination and the object on which this this thing is happening.
You will have to also design implementation steps.
So, the representation right now uses a placeholder called Do and he's doing something.
So why?
So,that final for example,I drank soda or slurped it.
In case of positively misclassified case, what has happened?
People say it is the worst thing, but then they did the same thing with experts and they they have found to be between sixty two to sixty five.
So, all those things are involved which is not represented here. okay .
Okay .
First thing, we need a data structure for storing the state.
And a good designer of script can actually assume all possible cases, those scenes which might probably occur and all that and keep them there.
So it could do it but otherwise it believe me it's going to be hard.
It says if farmer is on the right side Fx and Ch cannot be on the left side okay and Ch and grain also cannot be on the left side.
What does that mean?
In in the slide, you will see that there is an additional value one which is provided, w one one, w two one, w three one, w n one.
Okay , so, that’s something which is very different from a computer program, computer system, and and human brain.
For example, if I get a pay slip, I hardly ever go in fact, I never have and I I’ve not seen others go and ask the clerk.
It’s a huge company and a lot of resumes used to come and they have to have huge bunch of experts to look at those resumes and and shortlist resumes for further processing.
We will also see something called variable neighbourhood descent, which is again little different, which actually is better for solution search which which we have just seen last in the last module.
So this is what is is is is represented the word, whenever the word like read or or listen, for example, or hear or whatever of that type, okay .
Now, that's the heuristic.
We we will not fix things unless and until it is a must.
When I'm talking about Ramlal or somebody, a greater than average, that average, that height is little lesser, okay .
Now, how you solve this problem?
If search path is going beyond that minimum value, it terminates that itself there and refinement search which acts over a solution space and and does exactly the same as branch and bound.
But if I I know there's a only few places
Remember why it is the decrement because you are picking up a worst state.
Okay .
So that is again an example of how you can derive meaning out of this thing.
I've talked about some verbs myself, now you can find a few more.
In in one way, we have already done like for example missionary cannibal problem you start from three, three, zero, zero then move along and at the end you get zero, zero, three, three.
And once we go through all this, you probably would realize how important it is.
So, L number of output units.
For example, color of skin and all that are almost similar.
okay What about this state?
the fox and the chicken or the chicken and grain.
Now, the second thing that we’ll have to once we have looked at those primitives, which can represent actions or verbs into those primitives.
Now you can see is is something quite similar in the next slide.
The process is the same.
So, you have Milkha Singh and double arrow PTRANS.
The case where you already these two are dead end. okay We can't proceed further.
So, testing is comparatively more difficult.
But, empirically it is proved that in most cases you get them.
You see that is a darkened narrow, one sided arrow.
Okay , a particular sequence which may be the right answer to this missionary cannibal problem.
And that is what I want my program to do actually, if I want to write an AI program.
In in case of annealing schedule it says that if the temperature is this you will have to do this. If temperature is this, you will have to do this.
There are total ten is to ten neurons in the brain and total ten is to fourteen interconnections, that mean, there are almost one thousand connections from a neuron to other neurons.
Some of the components of the initial state space does not exist in the final one and some of the one which exists in final one does not exist in the start one.
So, this context determines the meaning of a statement which we are not talking about.
Okay if we we'll we’ll let our study about heuristic we'll have some idea how we can choose one move out of most.
Now there is an automated cook service, Okay , which Jay enters all this information into his system.
So, that's why that is very needed.
Otherwise, we’ll go back to the second step.
So, that is the first thing, the no no algorithm issue.
Building a state space is what we have seen in last two modules, but that’s not enough.
Here we allow with a probability P.
Many, many search problems which otherwise are not possible to be solved and that's why it's become a very, very popular algorithm, as I said.
L M one C one and R M two C two and B L what does that mean?
In in We have seen two cases in one case we have looked at missionary cannibal problem the other case we have looked at farmer, fox, chicken grain problem.
that is better because the current architecture has multi core, is called multi core architecture where you have computers with multiple CPUs in in in real sense.
Both methods are used in factors.
The meaning of the statement appears in in in the representation and interestingly because meaning is represented, it becomes very easy for somebody to infer from it, something which otherwise is just not possible.
Why P?
It is possible but it is not possible in this case,
Now he everything cricket stadium and playing cricket and all that is there in these two statements but actually watching a match does not happen here.
You’re actually you start with minus three then zero then two then four. You reach to four.
Now, that probably requires some more explanation.
How can we solve this problem?
The issue is synchronization.
okay but...and in some cases it is player one and player two as well.
You will have to reduce the summation.
We used two components, one which is an actual distance.
A GA obviously is based on one simple principle which Darwin gave long back; survival of the fittest.
So, that is is something which is more readable .
How good is that method?
There are many similar things.
Thus the discussion becomes a little more complex but the same, okay .
Either children list is emty, there is no children okay what could be the case?
Another sequence node two, another sequence node three and so and so forth.
What what does that mean ? That you shouldn’t have cycles that you should be moving further.
What and we have already seen they leave pheromone trails and decide and all that and there are a lot of variations to this basic algorithm exist.
Basically, this module is about extending our discussion on CD that we are talking about, how syntactic rules can be used to construct CD representation of the natural statement.
So this is a Sparse neighbourhood. Okay , Anyway .
Now, every entity involved in a statement has some role to play and this role is represented by this conceptual role that we talk about.
So, if that is the case, you will have a look for and get that, actually once he gets this thing , he will meet expert and then try to make sure that expert understands whether he has learned that thing.
Sometimes you say, you find a little bit better statement like Sachin flew to Los Angeles from Mumbai.
Which one should I choose?
So if I'm I'm using a small number of nodes as an average number of nodes that you produce, number of children that you produce its called Sparse neighbourhood.
Anyway, but when you find that the script is appropriate, you have immense advantage of using them.
And if if you have a serious detailed script, which the example that I gave is not one, very simple one just use for pedagogy purpose.
Okay and when I want to when I went to watch a match, obviously, I'm interested in viewing a match and I have that money, kind of Okay .
So, so if fox is on the left hand side, B is two.
I'm using a body part, so MOVE is also involved.
It can be any.
So after few iterations probably the solutions that you have are better than the earlier ones. Okay .
For example, I go to restaurant, obviously, I have two have two entry conditions.
So, the addition is this okay on CD.
Usually, there is an alpha release as well which is circulated the company only and people who are using that product in the company will come back and give you their feedback.
So, those things are the first two things that usually the KE would like to have.
Three plies, only three levels in game the level of tree is called ply. It is eighteen into twenty into twenty for twenty being a branch factor, look at the value I can't read that.
3,5,0 which is already explored is a parent basically of the same node and 6,2,0 is the other one.
The top one is max that is we are playing.
And for Tic Tac Toe let us look at some of the characteristics.
So that's precisely what we say we disallow six, twelve and fourteen.
For example, when we are talking about water jug problem, we think that the water is available.
You've seen problems with the scripts, we have seen aa fleeting scripts, we have seen how appropriate scripts can improve your reasoning. We have also seen some latest aa im improvements in this representation.
If we if you have a move which can provide something called threat of fork.
if your heuristic function is good enough and you're choosing the best moves, then you're going to save a lot of memory as well as computing power and you will be able to complete the this thing in time.
You may invite and you may run both things together because the customer wants it.
You can't write algorithm.
Now, you're also going to add us a policy enforcer.
Those pheromone values are indicators for others.
So, that is something is a component which is part of the goal state.
If it is not, the plan is not valid.
Then W plus now, you talk about the next input.
They could concentrate more on more better resumes and it could result into fast far better short-listing process.
And there are events like reading menu and ordering and and eating and paying the bills and so on, so forth happening.
Manoj gave him the chocolate.’
General purpose would be almost impossible because it has to be generic.
It will pick up random parents and generate that thing , it combine them okay .
And we have already seen that, that how the script can be invoked.
And the third option is simple - Ask the user, what is Epicurean?
In our character recognition case, the N value is eight- one okay .
It just combines Y plus Z, obviously the the middle jug in that case will contain no milk .
Friends, welcome to the Seventeenth module of AI .
I have reached to D.
How it is done?
So let us let us look at this.
After that you start the development process, okay , the basic framework in inference engine is decided, user interface is decided and core knowledge base is constructed, new class, rules everything, now is written implemented, the test data is inserted and start any ancillary part that is required is also added to this, okay , and testing and all that is required.
And when cycle appears the rest of the elements are picked up from the other parent and copied.
In fact, GA has shown that it can actually solve some serious AI problems not sorted for years.
Delta is the difference between the objective function value of the current state and the new state, okay .
Okay , and and and when you talk about MTRANS , information comes from various sources.
For example, I have parent one as A, C, B, D, E, F, G and parent two as C, D, B, G, A, E, F Okay and I decide that I use the middle three elements, in the case number one, the parent one is B, D, E, parent two is B, G, A Okay .
The ppt is is talking about this four three gallon jug problem, two rules one is specific and the other one is general, the eight five three gallon milk jug, again there is a specific and a general rule and also a state space representation .
If the slope is like this, if slope is more steep than the earlier case, little change in a way it will increase the output much further.
If anything less than that, what’s the point?
So, when I'm suggesting something, probing something as an expert, why should I be doing it?
The algorithm works like this.
The other method you just get all solutions, okay and pick up the best solution, refine that solution, okay , pick up the solution.
So, word love is used in many forms, but basically the meaning out of this is that Ram loves Sita is is the essence of the statement and that is basically represented.
The number of missionaries on the left hand side must be greater than number of cannibals on the left hand side or number of missionaries are zero.
Not only highest it is more than the collective value of everybody else.
Okay . You reached to four you can’t move further, Okay that’s that’s called local maxima, Okay .
In our case, it is It’ll Here I've taken L.
It can come down but the problem is that if it comes down, there's a threat from the the rook.
For example, when you say that ‘Sachin bought a bat’ there is a concept called ‘store involved.’
So if, even if I explore, that node will give me ten is of no use.
That means that in the initial run avoid all moves which moves missionary on the other side.
So, that is again very critical point here in the implementation.
Look closely at this representation.
But the other one when you apply the second rule, the state that we get has value two so we move to two.
Knowledge representation scheme also is to be provided in big detail and provide clear cut idea about how and how the knowledge is represented and how it is inferred and so on and so forth.
We begin with 8,0,0.
So, the biggest advantage of CD is that such things are represented using the same structure.
B represent fox and fox value is two.
One epoch is said to be over.
But a more important thing is, I must have some clear means of telling which move is better.
So, this is something which is about prerequisite.
It is not easy in fact, you probably have heard about a robot which makes pizza but that's the only thing that robot can do and only if everything is stacked exactly for his requirement .
This is about beginning from an initial state, move around in state space and stop when any one of the goal states is reached .
So, more number of samples.
So, every A contain eighty one inputs.
Look at the second figure and look at the data which is generated from that figure.
Now, every input, every input of A will be nine into nine, total eighty one we’ll use okay .
Now, watching a match he has to be there in the stadium and and to travel by bus he has to be there on on the bus stand.
You can see that it connects an action action with an actor okay .
Okay you know that it is quite true for us as well.
Once this is done, then the actual processing of algorithm starts from now on, because now we have some value of pheromone set for all segments.
The corresponding element of B here is A.
So this is precisely what I'm doing.
Ant colony optimization is a very popular algorithm some time back, is still being used, but not to the extent used to be.
So, we’ll take the right child of 3,5,0 and we get one.
So pheromone value is some constant value divided by the length.
Again let me repeat.
The other one ‘Sachin did not’, in fact, the negation part, ‘going to a restaurant.
Row is the constant rate by which it is decremented.
Okay , one example here is is is given the handout is that when we go out to dine, we expect it to be a restaurant, obviously.
Now, we decide the objective function value of the resultant state after applying this rule what we get is a worse state than this, okay .
And there is something called virtual infinity.
And this is something which is there in humans as well.
That's what the state space representation.
On BC so you have on A table, on D table, on C D on BC.
As I said in last ten years, how many times you asked for and how many times you were successful?
But then there is a problem.
Second o ne, A dot deletion, A dot deletion again you take an intersection with goal state.
And if it is found, the the match we'll store in the usable database.
We have also looked at the Alpha and Beta cutoff at the end of this this module.
And other stakeholders are also invited, because you're not going to code.
I've not written how to move around in state space, how you choose value of variables and all that like A B C D is are the variables that we've used.
So this is how you represent the state space .
Okay now let us summarize what we need as as components.
okay The reason okay of Ravan’s health going to minus ten is this.okay .
So, testing is to be done from that angle and that's why it is different than conventional system and you should also make sure that what will happen if the decision is wrong okay .
For example, Sachin is clever, that clever is an attribute of Sachin.
Otherwise, you can just forget, it is better.
Well, we see genetic algorithms are very good at those kind of problems where you have to apply perturbation search, Okay .
If there is a cycle you’re not moving further, you're circulating at the same place.
There's a problem which is possible to be solved but then we don't have programs which can play table tennis.
That is altogether a different thing.
So, throw is little more complex, point is there there is a if there is a verb, which indicates physical transformation of any object, you will have to have PTRANS into that representation.
Now, it is quite possible and when when the speaker begins with a phrase or two, it is possible that the meaning of statement is possibly in three different directions.
There are lot of things here that you need to know.
But it's very critical that you you use that structure because it offers one of the biggest advantage of reusability.
Not only that Next to next also is empty.
And we have looked at some of the components like positional importance of the node we have seen, because that is to be considered in SEF .
If If you can combine both of them in your representation, that’s the best.
In most cases that will solve your problem. The next slide talks about how hidden unit learns to be active.
And how you do that?
So, what you could do is, you can say that the pheromone value for the next segment next period is equal to older pheromone value multiplied by one minus row.
The other point which I talked about threat of fork which is shown in the next slide, you can see that.
The the ATRANS , abstract transfer actually, it talks about mental control actually, the the control or or or ownership or position transfer.
Okay , but the third one even human reader cannot get what it is.
We are we are going to learn about how CD representation can be actually used to convert a statement into that representation.
We already seen one more method of binding it to a typical length and it’s called depth bound depth-first search.
If a progression is relevant, it is actually moving in the right direction.
That means multiply both of them and take a square root of it.
Here it is if you write general, it is going to be very hard.
But obviously, this is different.
So what we have?
So what a translator program will do is explore all these three branches together .
It is basically decided by this plausible move generator.
So, here also we have inputs, the inputs are x1 to xn and there are weights, weights are w1 to wn, okay .
So, Sachin moves himself and object is Sachin himself.
No, no, no, this is not what we wanted. Even in that case, you get a very, very strong feedback on what is not wanted.
And so that you must conclude that Jay has done something to reach from stadium to the bus station, Okay .
Not only that, because it is more recent also, because it's travelling faster it is more recent, number of pheromone also is more.
what I do is I I'll just mingle them in a way that or in a way that I generate new nodes out of it.
So some value is decremented okay over over the period of time plus whatever is added by newly new ants which travels down that path.
But then, if you provide friend’s image, you should say friend and it says the other one, the other one is provided, says friend, these are the examples of misclassification.
All explored nodes are kept in the other area.
Now, try to understand.
When I apply maximum, I get the same answer.
Whenever you explore a node, whenever you generate children for a node what if the child is already explored.
Now the the first condition done, but the other one A is resting on top of B okay that becomes when you put A on the table, A is resting on B becomes false.
And what does that mean? That means that it is ten, it is win for us, the problem is solved, Okay .
One is variable descent neighbourhood method where you use different neighbourhood functions which let you determine number of children for a given state.
Now let us look at the next method called Depth-first search or DFS.
If farmer is on the left hand side he cannot be on the right hand side.
You can see that it is it is not difficult to understand how it operates.
And why it is there?
We have discussed last four steps of expert system design process.
You can say that farmer is on A side, fox is on B side chicken is on C side and grain is on D okay .
When you say throw, what does that mean?
So, you need to group rank and order your knowledge, you need to find out missing points in that knowledge, you you will have to remove redundant and unnecessary part from the knowledge.
If I also include zeros and ones, I’ll have I need thirty six outputs.
With a branching factor of thirty five chess is an example, at level number one you have thirty five.
What is addition?
Why?
That is done many times in in in CD .
So, PTRANS talks about changing of location.
Now, you may believe that it’s almost the same.
Now, if you want to find out the cost to reach to that city, you can assume that that cost in the final tour, that city is connected to two nearest neighbors okay .
To select some you may use a function, which is quite similar to heuristic function but here it is called a fitness function.
Now, you can see that the same relationship and the object is Ravan.
So we can get a tour with lowest value.
Okay , so those are preconditions or entry conditions they are something called props which are the objects involved in this here it is tickets and seat and match and so on so forth.
But here in this case, two is the best node, so we’ll explore two.
But then there is some difference here, okay .
So temperature value is reduced .
That nodes here it shows that dark nodes are either repeated or something which are already explored. Okay .
And it unless it cannot find a food source it is not going to come back.
We’ll use sigmoid function sigmoid function is used here.
Interestingly, two of my students implemented neural networks for a very different cases.
So, whoever initiates the process, whoever is is the actor, is associated with this particular association, this this particular the primitive, okay , okay .
For example, let us again take chess.
It talks about the meaning the statement carries, and we'll be looking at that particular part in this particular module.
So, that is it.
Okay let us let us see that.
In fact, branch and bound can be combined with any search algorithm, even we have taken the case of finding the shortest route between two cities.
Now let us pick up second one, G.
Welcome friends!
So, this is represented this way.
For example, I gave the example like Sachin gave his bat to Sarfaraz, the ownership is transferred from Sachin to Sarfaraz.
In this particular module, we're going to look at the remaining four of them.
For example, Milkha Singh ran is is Milkha Singh and PTRANS and the object is himself.
But you can change that slope here and there, to improve the speed and and let the algorithm solve the problem in faster, sometime that is needed.
So, that's the simplest type of planning.
And there is an example shown in the next slide.
They they take the lower part of the obstacle, the upper part of the obstacle.
Y is less than or equal to five.
The third one is called Cyclic crossover.
Not only it is complex to write rules, it is also complex sometimes to write the prerequisites of the rule.
Not only that, this is also useful for exploring in real time.
But the important part is to bring the chicken back.
So experts will have to look at only five hundred resumes and out of which they may figure out that this fifty are good or hundred are good or hundred and twenty are good.
He used that and most of the other books also and other representations where I've seen, they are like that.
We believe that the measurement that we are getting now we are very good now.
If we use the same string surprisingly both children comes out to be the same.
We have already seen.
There's path one and path two.
Remember the higher value of T will let you move to a worse state with more probability than less.
Now expert obviously has given his knowledge.
You, This If you use only that single layer of perceptron it cannot or perceptron or neural network, it cannot.
But let us again pick up a problem like chess and it’s it's becomes impossible for us to get an answer.
Whatever we have done so far is called Path Representation.
You can see that and I I I bold face them to make sure that you have understand.
Okay .
So, that that is something which is different in CD and interestingly because of that different statements with the same meaning will have same representation in in conceptual that's one of the strengths of CD and there are some how it is done actually?
Okay , so that's the problem.
So this kind of representation is called State Space representation.
At the end we'll see that there is something which is possible to be applied to this, which improves our search process and the next module we'll we'll see that thing in a little more detail.
As I said, it is cheating and is not desirable.
simulated annealing, we allow bad move, okay .
So, what is the solution?
If it is more than whatever you you can fill the the the three gallon jug and whatever is remaining is there in the five gallon jug.
Sometimes people say it’s a case of common sense but common sense believe me my friend is very, very uncommon .
Right now we have no clue.
There are many factors which determines whether, this one very raw factor is called piece advantage the number of pieces that I have, compared to number of pieces the opponent has.
If I I can make sure that my knight is in a place which threat of fork to the opponent can capture an important piece of the opponent like Queen, I have an advantage.
Plausible move generator is assumed here.
So what you do is you use a C, they they are being used okay .
Fox is on the right hand side, F will be two but then both of them cannot be two.
It is not very similar to something that we have studied so far.
Take huge amount of time if I use a lot of components that demands SEF to be optimal.
D is not free because there is something else called X resting on it.
For example, there is there is something called zero zero. Let us begin.
In the next module, we’ll be looking at how these particular simpler forms can be combined into representing complex statements.
So, you may write a program to do it.
With that we’ll conclude.
So, that's the case.
The example was of a predicate we’ll study about predicates later but when when I say L F FR L basically is an example of a predicate.
So, and we start with remember we start with the final one and eventually because it is a stack you pick up the top then it is the first action to be applied, apply that action to start state, change the state.
That is applied in chess and many other cases many times.
The capacity of the X is eight.
So in the beginning we’ll use just this and calculate.
Now you can see that what we are talking about is almost hill climbing, otherwise best so far is current node.
clears throat Okay .
This could have been a a five hundred into five hundred or five thousand into five thousand pixel image where there is a signature.
This figure actually talks about.
Now we do not explore all the nodes, we only explore the leftmost.
So, there is an arrow which indicates so.
And as I said, such connections are plenty, on an average one thousand connections.
Because it works with the search tree where you have alternate layers of min and max layers.
They are they are doing something else.
You can see that it is not dependent on MTRANS.
The direction towards LA from where we don't really know but it says that Sachin PTRANS himself in the direction of LA from somewhere okay .
It is not, fine, go go further.
Now, this is also is very important component for generating a component for SEF .
In fact, there's not one problem.
So this is what GA is all about.
And you can see there are three things in in PDDL as I said there are three components of PDDL three things: preconditions, additions and deletions.
Thank you.
So, it's basically an algorithm.
So, this is a relevant regression.
We say that, the state space is is represented by X Y Z where X plus Y plus Z is eight.
There is an action, there is an actor, there is an object and so on so forth.
And the next three columns actually describe the rule applied, number of missionaries moving on the right hand side, number of cannibals moving on the right hand side.
Sometimes people call it only a refinement .
Whenever a statement is presented CD representation, the first job to convert that into CD representation is to derive meaning out of that statement and once the meaning is derived, that thing, okay , is represented.
Now let let us learn little more about human genome.
This method is useless .
So that is if that is very similar to hill climbing if if you reach to a place where it is impossible to apply any rule, a dead end, provide best so far.
And we have to use valid moves as I said.
What we do is something very different.
What does this artificial neuron do?
Okay so based on that answer that he has got or if you travel back you can say that because he was late and could not see the toss, Okay .
So, once that part is done, why we are doing that thing?
So, that is one upon one plus E raised to minus summation and the summation we've already seen okay .
Because game tree you cannot explore completely, based on the time available or whatever you you just stop somewhere in the middle.
Now an important thing happens.
B says it as minus five is not very good for us, C seven is far better, D is three and E is minus one.
Now you are writing the classes.
Three integers, simplest of representation of this particular problem.
The the actual case all spaces, suppose for example you have twenty solutions,
Now, the first one is A.
We’re going to have a quantitative representation of goodness of the state.
Okay , for example, when I say, Milkha Singh PTRANS , it’s called a single conceptualization, when we talked about predicate logic, Okay , we we used a structure and we call that thing a predicate, here we call that thing as as a conceptualization.
I start with the first element and put it there.
For example, one example that is given in in the handout says, Sachin gave his bat to Sarfaraz.
The mental information is being transmitted, okay , for example, let us take a verb called ‘Remember’,
One is three four gallon water jug problem.
It begins with the first element, Okay .
Now what those values are?
And obviously, only those deer who who run fast and smell better can survive.
Okay . These these type of search where if we don’t have any help from heuristic, we don’t have any domain knowledge, we don’t have any information about which move is better compared to others, we call it Unguided Search.
I can solve it but can a computer program do it?
Pick up the temperature value T from the annealing schedule.
The next one is called GRASP, which is which has very clear meaning, so you don't need to worry more about GRASP, GRASP is picking up something holding it.
I'm not going to talk about that because little more complex and more confusing, please understand that these are simple primitives and you can order them in multiple ways to represent the same meaning.
This is the limitation of the language itself.
One of the disadvantages here a single statement representing basically a a a sequence of things.
So I don't need to describe the entire rule once again, but you can see that it is the same.
Now try to understand what this mean.
how better how much they are, the quantitative representation, they'll not be able to give but here we’re thinking that way.
It has only two options left - left and right.
Number of missionaries are more than number of cannibals is not allowed.
Toh , these are the differences; on A table and on B; this is what we want to achieve.
We have seen how scripts are used in representing statements which represent complete scenarios and not a single statement here.
And I am going to use them in this crossover method.
okay , now let us jump into little jargon.
It belongs to a a a specific class you just run some testing, measurements and letter.
okay .
Some authors describe the layer at the end.
And the CD representation look pretty pretty superficial on the face of it.
In this module we are going to see some other search methods, little better methods of searching.
Okay .
what the content of that sample, Okay and it tries to figure out, Okay .
Can you write a program to do it?
It is very good rule six, it’s not solution but then there are no possible rules to be applied.
So, it's basically a recursive process. And that's the reason why stack is used.
If A is positive, E has to be negative.
Let us look at the state space.
Axon connects itself to dendrites of other neurons.
Again, you can see that the word ‘attack’ is not represented as collection of primitives.
In In case of a A to B it is two twenty and A to D is two twenty-plus two fifty plus one fifty.
Anyway so let us see what this particular rule is doing.
So ATTEND is, ATTEND is attaching your sensing organ or attending your se.. se.. sensing organ to something which is coming from outside.
Offspring inherit genes and attributes and then this thing the process produces next generation and once you get the new generation the old generation is just wiped off,
But then we don't need to.
Okay Now what we are trying to stress here?
We’ll be discussing about conceptual dependency.
The static evolution function requires two things, current state as well as player.
But the, here there is one more word which I'll have to use.
So, a four gallon water jug will have two gallons of water at the end.
We are pouring either the milk in five gallon jug or three gallon jug.
We are talking about missionary cannibal problem and something.
This is again an example where back propagation algorithm is used.
The fourth rule- We pick up an example of Sachin went to LA.
If you only consider uppercase, thirty-six uppercase plus the digits and fifty-two when you consider upper lowercase and together.
So, this is these are the initial and final state.
And second , sometimes when you don't have heuristic, but the problem domain is small enough, you can go for Unguided Search Methods as well .
Same way in other domains, okay so, there are some symptoms, which tells you that there is something wrong.
If I have my piece can move to a center where I have better control, I have an advantage.
I I want that less than twenty-two if something is more than that the path is of no interest to me.
That also is perfectly valid because that also is acceptable acceptable in literature.
That's all.
A heuristic for this particular problem can be something like this.
So, it won’t remain at as attractive as possible as as it it should be after a while.
And once again we get 5,0,3 which is already explored before.
okay The algorithm we have designed returns two things.
If you avoid eighteen moves for example, the entire eighteen sub trees are pruned from the search tree.
One was again done by Schank and all that.
You have to have some values constraints on those values here.
Now, let me repeat what I'm talking about.
So zero zero to three zero is impossible.
In that case, in most cases you have to re-run the program.
okay Functional description of each module this module is going to do that, okay , objectives and the problems, okay , objectives and the challenges of every every module that you will are going to work on.
It is max so I'll the player is playing.
And in this case, the exploration seems fruitless because eventually I get all four of my children having value N, looks quite similar but it is in true sense, they are not.
Now here again unlike the other case, where we call it heuristic function this is called objective function.
He enjoyed playing cricket with his friend there.’
How much to reduce?
Now how you that threatened, you can see that there is no statement like that, no indication of threat but it can still do it.
So, it is possible to have multiple initial and final states.
So, total summation is calculated the same way one upon one plus E raised to two minus some is calculated which you can see on the screen.
L and N again, he chooses L and N and D again, he chooses N, N and L, N and N and N and D and there's no win yet.
So these are all unguided methods.
Now, what what set of motivational strategies would will be able to actually retain the employees.
Now this is not all that simple because what you are planning to do is to solve on BA first.
Whenever these three features exist.
What I'm going to talk about is how one can represent a statement in a CD form.
Remember x zero is not an input, it is a value one and w zero is minus threshold value.
Prototype is first thing.
You don't require expert for it.
What are the deletions?
An expert actually verbalizing in this verbalizing his knowledge in this process.
If it is better go ahead.
That that's a problem, okay .
But then if you do that, you will find that it is phi.
The left hand side we had M one.
Slow if you continue , if you do that process in a slow manner , the problem is that it takes a lot of time.
You just pick up next city from the list of cities.
So, other side you cannot have that okay .
Everybody every other city than A.
For example, why Jay asked who won the the toss can be answered in two ways.
And this is the example of the integer values that I was talking about.
Okay with a third case for first two human reader can easily get Okay , how to get that thing in in the program computer program is a hard job.
And we have also seen how one can assign values to those variables and so on so forth to make sure that you you start from initial state and reach to the final state, applying various preconditions, checking various preconditions and make sure that the rule applied in a valid manner.
So, that simplifies our description.
Here it is shown as tau T plus one.
A spectrometer reading and there is something called mass resonance spectrometer reading.
3,5,0 can be converted to 0,5,3.
Generate new state by applying next rule, no rules left.
knowledge engineers learn the basic idea about the domain, also learn how expert processes the knowledge, how it stores that knowledge, what is good and bad about this system, what to concern about, where to focus more and so on and so forth he learns.
Surprising? We are doing it in fact.
So if you if you’ve used verb like pick pick up, hold and all that, if you want to represent them using CD , you will use GRASP as as the the primitive.
A dot preconditions so preconditions this is how you get the previous state.
Now, that is not good, you're going away.
you can see on the slide that you have one typical position on the left hand side, one typical position on the right hand side and just show that the move is characterized by having the position of the pieces here which is shown on the left hand side and the the result of the move is something that you have it on the right hand side.
So they are in true sense to be represented in CD form.
You you cannot explore the entire level further but you can explore that node further.
I have already told you the mutation is a process of adding serious randomness, it is very different when compared to this thing .
And you can see that the Epicurean problem that I talked about, now if you have a right ontology which clearly indicates that Epicurean is is type of a restaurant, reasoning can be pretty easy. Okay .
But if if you try depth bound search and if if if there is a password, which is of four character or five character and if you’re if you're just exploring probably you’ll be able to crack it better, because it takes otherwise it takes much more time.
We we have looked at one very simple method of characterizing AI problems called state space representation.
We’ll skip that thing for a while.
So, These are shown on the slide.
First thing - It is possible to have multiple representations for the same problem.
How can you represent cry?
okay When Schank has provided his his own as I said, you can come out and have your own primitives.
okay , so static evaluation function is a very good, very important thing, fundamental thing for game playing.
Toh , the summation suppose if I want to calculate noise the sum that is happening at H one how it is calculated is shown in the next slide.
In that case, level number one is one, level number two is thirty five, level number three is thirty five into thirty five .
So in case of exploring only first five is a sparse neighbourhood case, exploring twenty is little more dense , exploring ninety is really dense .
L Fr fx ch and Gr - farmer, fox, chicken and grain, all four of them on the left hand side.
So what we have is this.
We’ll we’ll or you will have to look at previous statements or next statement to figure out what that ‘Do’ is.
They learn from their own experience. It’s very similar to us.
So in the case, the leftmost case, we have two outputs - L one is N the other is N.
So, there are multiple initial, multiple final states possible in in other problems.
The sigma does what?
And if there is a problem with memory you cannot do that, so we’ll have to repeat that again.
With that we’ll conclude.
Try to understand.
You will have to decide program logic for this.
Now can you tell me whether the action is relevant or not?
In the goal state if you see goal state A is on the table in the initial state it is not on the table.
Okay and the second part of it says that if the farmer is on sorry the farmer is on the left hand side, you can’t have the same combination on the right hand side, okay .
For example, in our case, we can do but think of a a case of chess.
So, that kind of an alternate path is if provided in the script, one can even reason with that and can clearly conclude that dining does not happen and obviously payment also does not happen.
And you will have to also identify sources like what are the sources of knowledge.
If they cannot understand, you probably will need to modify.
Now when you provide this cutoff and minimizing level, it is called alpha cutoff.
Otherwise, it can be a first move, can be the third move, can be the fifth move , so, what's the current state?
Now this is called Breadth first search.
I’m testing everything for a solution.
You don't invoke that script.
So, it you can write this thing as w one one, w one two, w one three and w one and so on.
One more You can even add one more.
So, goal stack planning is one method of planning.
So, it it it calculates it that way.
These are called motivational strategies.
So that's usually the constraint.
So, these are assumptions .
How?
Because as I said if you execute everything, remove all difference, it is quite possible due to side effect some other differences are not executed. So, once again you look at that goal.
Okay quite exaggerating.
Again let us see the same thing.
That’s a problem.
Ram did something to to kill Ravan.
Okay , waiters and menu and everything is added, Okay .
Now if the question is asked why Jay asked who won the toss?
Well, let us start.
Because of that the ordinal representation makes it faster.
So that's something that the system has to do when it’s working with scripts like this, Okay .
Now I've already got five which is very good.
You can see that the second slide that the hidden unit which learn to active and there is an horizontal line, also learns to be active and there is I and there is H.
Now you can see this example.
Remember, if you explore more promising paths first, it is better for us because we'll be able to eliminate the paths which are non-optimal, okay .
Okay C plus G is four again the same logic.
Now you probably see this graph and wonder what is N because I just said win lose and drawn and why N?
Okay , so when you use this variable neighbourhood descent and why it is called descent, please understand.
So, it does a simple thing.
We have already seen how a problem can be represented using a state space and move around in state space and so on so forth.
Don’t ask me further, I don’t know.
Suppose, if I I’m here and I have five different moves from this I’ll apply this function to all of them.
There are hundred, almost infinite number of other ways to represent this problem.
So this is what is known as steepest ascent hill climbing.
And initially it it was considered to be a very good thing unless somebody found there was a guy called Minsky who found that however good this neural networks are, they are incapable of solving some problems, which are we which he called non -linearly separable problems.
State space representation means, I'm defining all states using the simple formula.
How the this ants find the food source and then retain that?
And to maximize the crystal size of solid this thing , there is something called the annealing schedule which is followed.
But then when you use this script the appropriate script you can reason like nothing before.
Now look at the four prerequisites again .
So, that heuristic value of one cell where we have the value and other two are empty is better, has higher heuristic value than a cell where we occupy that thing and two others are occupied by opponent.
What are the advantages of this representation?
For example, Garry Kasparov, the Deep Blue machine which IBM build which has beaten Garry Kasparov three-two if you remember there it was there in news for quite some time.
Sometimes the expectation is that user expects you to explain its reason, which is not there in a conventional system.
If I say any two I'll have again much more.
For a large expert system, it’s pretty critical.
Frame is a very simple structure, a script is comparatively more complex.
No, there is some difference.
So, this one zero to n only includes the ants which travelled along that path and no other ants.
Remember we have discussed about solution space in the earlier modules.
Well, there is something similar available but is not basically heuristic function, something very, very different.
Let us pickup something called a Tra...Travelling salesman problem.
We'll look at the other problem called farmer fox chicken grain problem and precisely what we are trying to address here is is called multiple representation of the same problem.
It says , and we are only using a three integer vector value X, Y and Z.
So B mapped to B, B is mapped to G and A is mapped to E, Okay .
But that may not be true if M one is zero.
These are three things happening, Okay .
So, that means M missionaries and C cannibals moving from left hand side to right hand side.
You don't have time.
Minus five, two, minus one and two are yet to be explored .
So that is one thing which we do not want .
The program actually indicated that there is possibly a similar reason here.
The same thing is used by similar thing is used by the programs, okay .
So, if it does not recognize you just change, continuously change those weights, eventually it will converge into that set and you may ask me, if you ask me, what’s the guarantee that you have.
You can see that that the third unit learns to become active and there is the other line.
I'm not going to play C.
Here the computers use electromagnetic waves you know .
In the other one, order crossover method we we copy some part of the parent into a child and the rest is filled up from the other parent based on the order in which this thing appear in the in the parent itself.
Again, explore the next level and so and so. We explore tree, level by level and see if they get a solution.
you can see on the screen, its too huge a number.
L three three, R zero zero.
Okay , so I do not want to say that this is the list.
We have looked at back propagation algorithm and this is all the this is prerequisite to back propagation algorithm.
Let us begin talking about this thing .
But then in in rather chess its not all that good an example.
For example, in case of G, okay , you also have here you have a horizontal line.
This path is obviously longer than one that I’ve already found.
Saving is not these moves, but then the entire search trees which are generated by those moves.
What are the essential ingredients?
So, the every line has two components, xi and wi.
Because it is already explored.
Out of all possible cases you get converged to the best path and once you start getting such paths obviously, you will be able to get the right tour okay .
The first problem.
These two things are laugh coming inside as as as an input to Dendral and what Dendral does?
Now, that knowledge is to be be be completely modeled into a computer program that KE and developer is is the communication is pretty, pretty critical here and it constructs actually a lot of other important outcome.
Or when I travel by bus and so on, so forth.
So, you take a square root of it is nearly twenty two.
It's very similar to human chess player.
The the case number two and three also indicates the players movement okay .
Now, I know that this difference because this is not C is not on the table and I want it to be on the table.
So, that something is represented as Do.
So, there's no point exploring it and the other reason is that, I have minus three already see I'm a player, I have B and C.
Minimum level, minimum value of the children is passed up.
Sometimes it is not the object but instrument.
Their work they are working in a coordinated way and the pheromone value is an indicator, the the tool which they use for coordination here, okay .
Second, we'd like to avoid defeat if I I don't get to a state which help me win, I’ll I’ll try to pick up a state where I can avoid defeat okay .
But if if you can think of a clever idea, the presentation becomes much simpler.
How do you decide that this packet requires deep inspection?
That means total amount of milk that we can have is eight.
If you use heuristic you become guided.
It was designed to make sure that Gary’s this thing the moves can be thwarted.
So, here there is an additional memory provided ontological memory and obviously it has the other memory called episodic memory which is almost the same as scripts.
Now suppose you have five outgoing possible lines.
Okay and this is a small thing contribute to larger structure, that’s the great thing about CD .
And now let us see what the next two lines describe.
And the example is something that we've seen in the previous module. Milkha Singh ran, okay .
We could have applied rule number nine eight six etc.
Variable neighbourhood descent is little different type of an algorithm.
So it's possible for somebody to write rules for it?
So, that’s one example.
So what does that mean? I I I’m given a chess board position, I apply that heuristic function, that heuristic function will give you give me a value between minus ten and ten.
What does that mean?
We have seen the basic building structure of conceptual dependency, we looked at different primitives.
In this module we'll be looking at the MiniMax algorithm.
Let's see what how can I write the state space and this is going to be much more complex than the previous case, little more complex, okay .
But then, later on researchers found that it if you want to get a if you have a very, very complex figure, where a feature itself is made up of other features, what you need is, multiple layers.
You can see that now, two is the best this thing .
We are not going to lose any our game there.
I'll have to back the values up.
Similarly, H zero also indicate the W zero, in that case H zero, the second layer, okay .
We’re looking at just all nodes, Okay .
The subscripts that we are using here, one one to n, okay .
Minus nine is worse than my minus three.
So, this is basically the process.
So, we are going to discuss about them.
So, what you do is you apply some other function which gives parent say five , but then two children seven and nine then you can pick up nine.
How can you represent anything of that sort?
Okay , we'll be looking at the rules which are used to represent different shades, different types of statements.
So what we do?
Where Y plus Z is less than three. Total amount of milk in Y and Z is less than three, then what you can do is you can pour everything in in in this , the the three gallon jug.
It is the opponent king is the king is under attack.
It is not about starting from start state to go to final state, no.
Now, in the beginning you may feel that the problem is almost the same as the previous one.
But these are the basic building lob blocks of CD .
So if you if you give some human being this problem to solve, probably he will be able to do it in few minutes.
That's that's their primary source, that’s primary job to do.
What we do is we just write some sequence of random states, Okay and call that thing as node one.
CD is kind of a structure where you have all verbs listed and there is a form available.
You may be surprised why should we talk about Unguided Search as we have already seen that most of the AI problems require heuristics and this Unguided Search Methods don't use.
And that actually the search also has a pretty big disadvantage as well.
How important is is a combination of knight and rook and something like that.
And static evaluation function is not the one thing. There are there are multiple components involved in it.
That is why it is allowed in GAs .
More components means more time and Deep Blue in conventional cases could explore six seven plies and sometimes fifteen to twenty plies and in that case think of a number of nodes that you will have to apply the static evaluation function to.
So this is how Depth Bound Depth-first search is is executed.
Ten indicates winning, minus ten indicates losing.
In fact if I say that, any any city exchanged with any other city then I am going to have around three sixty.
Remember, the static evaluation function or heuristic, is only an estimate and I have just played my own move, I have not seen what opponent is up to.
Because knowledge is updated in one place, the other place is not and you have a problem, the whole chaotic situation derives out of this problem.
There are basically two different types of search methods.
Now, once you have that information, you can understand that he probably has flown from Mumbai to LA, so that Mumbai the the earlier representation, the the starting point is a question mark and when the next statement is encountered, the starting point becomes Mumbai, so that's something which CD can do, in fact and that question mark, you can see is is an example of a conceptual tense. There is…for example you if you encounter a statement, if you drive rash, there is more chances of meeting with an accident.
So for everyone you are actually calculating.
So, here we have three inputs, three hidden or middle layer units and two output.
Will what we have seen in this particular module?
For example, you decide the limit of your search say is three.
So this is the slide actually talks about one example, fingerprint.
We start with that.
There are some description about that as well which is not part of our this thing .
Control strategy decides which rule to apply next.
Obviously, because fox and grain cannot do any harm to any other.
Then and then the state is valid, otherwise the state is not valid.
It is also possible.
okay .
So mutation is kind of a bad move
You won’t get further; if there is a mutation probably there is escape route possible.
Now we start along some other path.
So, that is a little better compared to the other one. C is as good as A because only one option, the top most row is possible for us to fill.
But that you don't need to check like the earlier case not and all that is just gone, why?
In case of best first, you can even pick up three.
King is under attack but queen cannot help.
So first example is comparatively sparse than the second one, okay . Why sparse neighbourhood to be used?
It It It moves to and fro and it’s not going directly to the the solution.
Okay . Apply heuristic function, see which one is better.
In metallurgy when the new alloys are made, they are melted at high temperature and they are allowed to cool down in a controlled manner.
The GA is based on the principle that living how living forms continue to become better to to make sure that they they they adjust with the environment.
Why A at the end?
There is no thumb rule for it.
L zero zero zero zero and R one two four eight .
Let us take a simpler example. It’s not all that simple, but comparatively simpler example of playing chess.
We start with 8,0,0, 3,5,0, 5,0,3 Okay .
For example, in chess, there is something called a threat of fork which we are going to see later or center control or or degree of freedom okay , how free our piece is to move around.
So, 5,0,3 will take our left child which is 8,0,0, next child 0,5,3, next child is 5,3,0. Okay .
The weights of each the each of these important things how important threat of fork is, how important center control is based on which some quantification is made and you get those values.
So, this way, eventually you will be able to get an optimal path from any node to any node and this is precisely what we want.
In this module we are going to talk about a typical method which is used to handle most of the AI problems.
First of all, it generates and then test .
And now we are also stating what are number of missionaries and cannibals, okay , and so on and so forth.
I've talked about the primitives which are most commonly used and represented but you can see that this is one view and please understand that this is Schank’s view.
and if if you do it that way, out of five you can generate twenty more.
We’ve already seen that there is possibility of using something called blind search methods like kit generation test, breadth-first search, depth-first search to handle the search problem.
For a serious case, you have a lot of other information, for example, it involves events like tossing and lunch and and tea and all that in a cricket match and also about the sequence in which order this happens, the toss happens in the beginning and then only then the match starts, and then you have innings, and there is a lunch break, and there is a tea break and so on so forth.
If you play chess, you know what I'm talking about.
So, that that is probably the meaning that you get out of that.
We’ve already seen AI is trying to solve difficult problems and difficult means is something that is hard for computer to solve, not humans.
Let me tell you, No Why?
Okay so it has all all data about Garry Kasparov, all with the the amount of moves and all that and so on and so forth.
At the third player itself you have reached to a dead end.
It is very simple, it pickup the any city at random, it pick up the first city at random and that is the city.
So if you want, if you are interested in studying more about GA probably those are the references, in fact there are pretty more, in fact there are many, many more resources on GA .
If it is possible for us to apply this action now and the action should convert a state into some other state where something which was there in the final state in the previous state should not be there if it is not there in the start state. And something which is not there in the start state in the goal state, it should be removed and something which is there in the start state should be added okay .
And now, let us talk about a few complex cases where these rules are combined into representing a statement. .
Those primitives are simple primitives and any language, any statement can be represented using that statement.
The system can actually use all combinations of all these approaches.
okay So when we reach there what should I be doing?
For example, when I'm dealing with this most trivials of problems, we have some implicit assumptions.
So to reach to D this is the minimum bound okay .
So, when you talk about representing fly, you have few other things rather than additional, in addition to be PTRANS .
Some other authors have shown some other way, but basically the algorithm is same, which is the same thing which we have studied in the previous module, we want to describe MiniMax algorithm in nutshell it's the the same thing which we have done.
The speed and again the decision is to be taken, the processing is has to be pretty fast.
In many cases, the the recursive process is invoked just because of that unwinding part being done in this simplified manner.
So, when the total is six, that means only farmer only fox and chicken is there on the right side, which we do not want .
So it is possible to use GA this way.
Every unit learns to pick up this feature and learn to become active.
Welcome friends to twenty first module of AI .
You may try.
First, not all rules are used.
So, that is again the second one, the second condition which is satisfied.
I’m trying for a state, my my pockets is one state.
And what are the operations that you will have?
Only farmer can row the boat, obviously grain and fox and chicken cannot.
And there are many candidate structures.
So, many a times you need to again sync between expert, knowledge engineer and the user but then I’ll give you at least that feedback.
okay . And the genome in human case is a long stand of estimated thirty five thousand DNAs in humans.
So it it it directs the behavior in successful directions and inhibits unsuccessful directions.
If you're an expert, you're going to provide your rules, the heuristic rules.
We don't want that.
Now, the earlier Ravan was dead because Ram did that.
That’ll add a lot of chaotic things, okay .
We have zero, this is better, so we move there, then minus one, not good, two, better, go there, four, we’re moving along quite nice, Okay , four.
Sometime you stuck up, okay .
We are also telling that Sachin not only went to LA, but he used a plane for his movement.
So they are part of the unexplored nodes.
Some presentation again, there are two things which I'm trying to talk about.
So, there are more than one things involved.
So that's what precisely it is doing?
So, what does ant do?
It is possible to have multiple hidden layers.
You can see that this is done if you put on table A then you get this on A table and then place on top BA you get on A on BA and once you do that you can test everything and you will get them.
One hidden layer The idea of having a hidden layer is to provide some means of finding out features of the input.
You can see there are five different cases.
Now we go further and find out the actual distance.
okay .
If missionaries are two, cannibal is zero.
Anyway, so let us Okay . The second thing, when a rule is applied , there is something which should change the state. The current state is X.
So, anything multiplied by zero will be zero, so, xi wi case all xi is where the xi value is zero, wi does not make any contribution to the summation.
So, we get that okay .
We are not looking at anything else.
Neuron’s memory is pretty less, it store very few things.
Now, here this is actually a subset of depth bound.
When you deliberating over where to move and there is a sudden obstacle, you'll have to take an immediate left movement or something
So, that's called the direction relationship.
The actual distance is obviously more than what we are assuming here.
I should be written in two things.
For example, throw is is a verb.
But that is all a very very common thing.
So that we cannot generalize, so we are not talking about, we just assume that PMG exists, will generate nodes for us, so that is assumed .
But , the problem with these methods that is going to enter into entangled into something called combinatorial explosion.
The Ordinal Representation actually allows single point crossover which was not possible in path representation.
So when we encounter a statement, Jay want went to watch a cricket match P is replaced by Jay Okay .
They make decision based on that local information which they have and each component, each ant is going to decide its path on its own and many ants work together, okay , for food source and when some of them find the food source, others will tend to follow this path and after some time they converge on that path.
I’ll have to learn what are false positives, what are false negatives, we’ll have to learn them.
Toh static evaluation function in chess is based on two different components - The rho obviously based on the original value, original capability of that piece to move around and capture other pieces and the positional.
M one greater than or equal to C one, M one equal to zero or M one M two is greater than C two or M two equal to zero and M one plus M two equal to three C one plus C two plus equal to.
Why?
Now we take the right child of 8 , Okay .
Obviously, what we want to do is to save the king leave everything, else be sacrificed for it.
So, out of that B is a better move.
Propel means applying physical force to the object, okay .
And whenever you encounter a statement, which probably contains many simple things about the world, those things are collected together, represented as a collection in in conceptual dependency, and in fact that is the great thing so there are thirteen total primitives, eleven plus then one was added later and and one more.
Chicken is four.
This is a harder problem but we only have two moves.
B is mapping to B, D is mapping to G, E is mapping to A.
Okay and we have few examples, I watched a match, what does that mean?
okay the the it’s going to be played by the opponent.
When fox and chicken, fox value is two ,chicken value is four total becomes six.
How you combine two strings?
Evaluation of a system is also done here.
We have not written a function over, we assumed a function called over.
For example, the person would say a lot of false negatives, uhlot a lot of false positives and those things.
It it it is not something which can be used to represent any any any statement that comes across and give you exact solution to that problem.
It’s not going to help us much we need a little more precise information for which we’ll use we use SEF Static Evaluation Functions and static evaluation function are applied on a state and gives us the merit of that state based on some range that we provide.
There is no feedback whether it is right or wrong.
It's Sachin is going from somewhere, we don't know where, we have just the statement, does not have the information that from where Sachin has started but we know that where Sachin has landed, Los Angeles.
For example, if the only farmer can row the boat and when the farmer is around nothing wrong is going to happen.
And then M one plus M M two is three and C one plus C two is also three.
You can see that you begin with all farmer, fox, chicken, grain on the left hand side and so on.
So for this, you again, insert one more goal called free D and for that probably you require one more action called place place on table X okay so which removes X from on top of D and place it on table.
Same way, D and E.
See the process.
Because an an action remember we use that word action now, we don't use word rules we call action, that action for action you have to have a prerequisite.
Because you know that this trail the for example, you lost yourself in a jungle, you you you’ll travel on a trail which is which is there, you know that this people have walked on this and that's why there is a trail.
Then you have an object what what is the object for M trance? match, Okay .
So the preconditions that you use should use M equal to zero.
You meet your friend after many years and he has grown in all dimensions but you’ll still be able to recognize him.
They are quite different from each other. Okay .
I am moving three gallons of milk from eight gallon water jug into the three gallon water jug. And 3,2,3 moving three gallons of milk from five gallon jug into the three gallon jug.
C on top of D is it part of the start state?
Okay .
So if you use nearest neighbor algorithm to find one path and then travel other paths and see if it if they are going beyond that nearest neighbors skip them.
Okay , the next one is Sachin gave his bat to Sarfaraz, I I won't talk about this.
The the value, the which comes next the suffix, zero one that value indicates which input unit to which output unit.
Now we are talking about pouring milk in 5 gallon jug.
We have an initial state, we have a final state, we move around in state space so and so forth.
N and D then you choose N not D.
One which talks about the tour cost which is already incurred.
For example, if I have two consecutive cells occupied and the third one is empty, it’s a very good thing, I I can just play the next move there and I’ll I’ll win so is that also a very good state.
So, they thought, that let us try to see how human brain does it and they worked on it and they tried they tried to mimic the working or functioning of human brain into computer programs.
Okay , let us look at this figure.
so It's basically an alternate thing.
But when you will choose when you switch over from the the sparse neighbourhood to dense neighbourhood.
For example, take a case of finding out who the person is.
Testing is done by something of Constraint Satisfaction.
The same way, there are ants coming back from E, okay , because F is a food source.
And it is quite fault tolerant.
So the the programmer program itself can reason from it.
Does something else.
Which out of which this two which one is relevant?
Point is, is a huge distributed interconnected dynamic structure.
If the summation is beyond a threshold value, a typical threshold value, it outputs one otherwise it output zero.
In fact I I won't return with without doing a process.
The simplest of hill climbing you apply one of the rules, look at what you get and that node if that node has a better value you just move there.
We’ll start all over again.
There are many other notations used there is no standard about this.
Same boat is available which can carry only two items.
Though all of them are cricket matches and most of the things remain same. There is some difference.
If it is the case, you say that the progression is relevant otherwise not.
You try you try for class I, then class II, then class III, then class IV.
We looked at conceptual roles, tenses and how a statement can be represented using CD .
For a simple reason that would like to avoid unnecessary calculation of moves.
An example, I I when I'm pushing something, I'm propelling, but the direction is opposite to me, when I'm pulling, I’m again propelling but the direction is different, you can see that and this is something which I was constantly trying to talk about since the beginning,that these are primitives, a very simple forms form of representation which can actually represent multiple , many, many verbs together.
So, you have those values differentiated that way.
So, wi xi is is going beyond a point you output one otherwise you output zero.
The idea is about using a very small tiny agent with very little information, little processing power but able to do things which are unable to do by many other things, very, very simple solutions which are parallel.
These are indications, okay , these are symptoms of something which is wrong.
So, you can see that verb called ‘shot’ is represented like this.
Mini, Why it is called MiniMax?
Okay , now let us see you using the formulae that we have used to see if this is relevant.
and not only that.
The annealing schedule determines the amount of worst moves to be allowed okay .
In fact, one of my PhD student did exactly that.
So, this simple method of spraying pheromone value and let it evaporate over time actually decides a path which is, I found recent, because the pheromone value, if it is old will evaporate, and second most preferred by others, because more ants travel along the path more pheromone value.
For example, when you encounter raining and match abandoned kind of a thing then obviously viewing does not happen or happy or sad, obviously you are sad because you can't watch so you you can understand that thing Okay ?
Now, there are two things happening – ‘terrorists attacking Mumbai.’
And again, whenever appropriate script is invoked it can predict things which which are not mentioned.
This rule number six we are talking about a case where there is something which is happening, and it is using something else as the instrument for doing it.
We'll soon see how that happens and basically is depth limited.
So, basically, we are incrementing number of missionaries and cannibals on the left hand side and decrementing from the right hand side, the rest is the same.
So we’ll choose the child with highest heuristic value that’s why it’s called steepest ascent.
Obviously, there are no algorithms here.
Let us see.
And there are two other examples.
We have already looked at genetic algorithms.
It's called ‘After the match gets over Jay went to his friend's house.’
We can pour the water out of the jug.
That's all the pretty simple.
Eight thousand is not all that large if you if you look at the complexity of chess.
You may worry or you may query that , what's the difference between branch and bound and nearest neighbor.
Where ABCD belongs to LR.
So we are we are yet to fill the four positions.
For example, when I am coming for college, I am looking for my car keys.
That's the reason why I would like to explore the search tree as deep as possible.
That is the important problem.
This is called tour.
okay so new twenty, now new twenty is pick up five and throw everything.
So, Sachin has actually moved from somewhere to LA.You can see that.
So, we have two jugs.
Now it has two arguments X and Y.
And one great thing about GA is that it can handle the combinatorial explosion problem, Okay .
For example, when I say that X Ram shot Shyam, for example, now here when you represent that in CD , it it represents it in a way that Ram used some weapon which shot a bullet, which enters into Shyam’s body, so this thing is actually represented.
Okay , so all these push and pull and and throw and kick, all of them can be represented using this propel, okay .
For example, I'm viewing a cricket match.
One more important thing here is called Mutation which we are not going to apply in our we are not going to discuss further in this module.
For example, a manoeuvering program in chess probably looks at a million states during the the the chess playing session.
And then eight and then ten, Okay .
It invariably finds the shortest path. That's the first thing.
There is a guy who is administering administering everything, an administrator.
Number of missionaries and number of cannibals.
So, with that probability we are jumping to that node otherwise not. Okay .
They are not same.
So, the programmer has to just convert, map this thing into that programming syntax.
Many most of the vision and audio related information is stored that way.
What are the advantages of this method?
So, it’s is a single structure which contain actually the essence of multiple scripts, Okay .
Please understand.
Number of output units depends on number of outputs that you would like to classify.
Now at in this phase, expert system, whatever expert believes it to be we his rules, processing got a lot of rules of thumb about everything and all that is understood by knowledge engineer and recorded.
Are there any restrictions?
Now we again run that thing, find out the complete search tree, and then decide the next move.
You cannot.
There was only one unit which is input, there’s one unit which is output.
So that is the meaning of this particular rule.
Okay .
Fr is on the left hand side at L Fx fox is on the left hand side, at L Ch, Ch is also on the left side.
So, we again > go back to our trivial problems that we have seen in the second module and we are going to explore them little further here and we'll see how one can apply these strategies.
We’ll see in the next module how exactly back propagation is going to solve the problem but this even the algorithm we’ll look at the complete algorithm in the next module.
The search tree is explored with every move that we take.
Okay , and you can see that there is some similarity with frames.
It is coming out of eyes and where they are going, doesn't make any sense here.
The pheromone evaporates at constant speed and the ants are capable to smell the pheromone value and so on so forth and tends to follow the path with the strongest pheromone value and and I've already told you that it it depends on two things - more ants travelling on that path where number of the amount of pheromone is more and the path is more recent the value is more.
So what is the outcome?
We have M one missionary C one missionaries on the left side, M two missionaries and C two cannibals on the right side and either boat is on the left side or right side.
In here the simulated annealing, the random moves are allowed in the beginning and almost disallow them in the final one.
And I've travelled A to B, B to C, C to D, and at that point of time, it goes beyond Thirty five, it is it becomes Forty.
okay .
So there are two components which are used.
Okay , so conceptual tenses past is P, future is F, negation is slash start of a trans transition is TS Okay .
That should be non-phi but it is phi.
So what we have the best node on the top.
So, remember what is to be deleted - something with start state and not in the end state, that is to be deleted.
So, those values are like fuzzy logic values, depends on context.
Please accept such things, okay , because expert systems are almost always designed this way.
So, it will do it that way.
In the second step we’ll evaluate those states.
okay so That also is indicator and that indicator is important for us here because at alternate layers, we are picking up either maximum or minimum values.
Now, that is my initial state.
So, that the next rule it says X Y Z, Y plus Z greater than or equal to five , you have X five though this is completely full.
Now you you like to learn about them.
So B is copied.
With this we’ll come to an end of this module.
Okay , smoke is ingesting, the smoke inside the lungs. Okay .
I have already talked about that in the first module, let us talk about that again.
For example, there are actors, so Sachin gave his bat to Sarfaraz then Sachin is an actor and and the ATRANS is is is the primitive now, that Sachin and ATRANS have some relation, that relation is to be like written and that is called dependency.
In the initial run bad moves are allowed almost with equal probability as of the good move but later on it is almost zero.
How will you code them?
Okay .
If I have this function I can just apply to a state and get that value and get that value between minus ten and ten and I’ll look at all possible alternatives.
Now, this information is to be provided to the back propagation neural network.
It is possible that sometimes even a piece a pawn has more value than a queen, sometimes okay .
If it is a goal state, quit.
But okay its our our choice of words basically, otherwise its same.
okay , Such things, when do you do?
Suppose if I design a heuristic function for Farmer Fox Chicken Grain problem for this, assume that there is a function exist.
You can ask for the color of the tail of the cat or ask for the hat the tennis player is wearing and the the computer program looking at the image can answer you.
Neural network, also we use small neurons, which can work together to solve complex problems.
You surveilling something, okay , then something is happening and you will have to take an action based on it.
Every level increases number of nodes exponentially and that’s the problem with this approach.
Now D, so the corresponding element of D in parent two is H.
May Maybe one more way of doing it is to pick up something which is not used before, okay , some rare kind of a step.
We find out the fitness function value.
Okay , so there's one more thing as I said people from different domain use different words.
You can see that there is no mention of dining, there's no mention of eating and so on.
The the default form of square doesn’t actually do it.
And if you know that the opponent is fond of doing it, make sure that you you keep a component there in in in your static evaluation function which avoid steps where the opponent can get to something like this.
We don’t have the value ten.
So, based on such information, we can provide heuristic value.
You can see that it is there are some pixels which are on, there are pixels which are not on.
I know that in the beginning I have to send two cannibals on the other side, I did that.
You just pick up a solution and see if it is so and in in hill climbing you actually pick up the better state. Okay .
But there are multiple ways you can use this algorithm and there is some similarity between ACO and the other things that we have seen.
BFS and DFS will find solution eventually if the search space is finite.
Then let the solutions combine, merge together and generate new solutions.
When we are talking about recombination, we are talking about combining parents in a way that they inherit almost everything from parent.
So, this is something that we do not want.
Now let us look at the other case.
If it is not, it will add the component which is not solved again.
What we want to have is, two gallons of water in a four-gallon water jug.
Regression is exactly opposite.
The same summation is calculated but then what you have is one upon one plus e raise to minus sum , you just calculate it that way, it is there shown on the screen that you you better see that yourself, okay , so this is called sigmoid function.
Level number two you have thirty five into thirty five I mean, thirty six in the earlier node.
Sometimes people call on..on.. only in addition to any algorithm.
Because remember, we have done something in the goal-state planning, we have learned that it is quite possible when you add a new task, you are testing for malaria, you may do something which fails the test of typhoid that you do earlier.
Okay , now let us try to understand what the problem is.
There is one example shown in the slide, you better see.
So that, the whatever we study here is going to be useful there as well.
Let me recap this this is part is pretty important.
So, that is also mentioned.
If you if you do it only once, that's a problem.
Because, just assume I have four different children, so for first child I'd calculate this value, a second child I get some value, third for I get some fourth also.
So, for example, I assume that for correct image, the output should be one and I get one.
okay , you can see that the state's evaluator, the next slide talks about that thing and we’ll label it in either of the three cases – win, lose and draw and you can see that they are already done.
So, what are the values of those Hiccup those X, Y and Z?
It’s kind of a generalized representation of a statement and it's quite similar too, if if you have some idea about how Unix works or Linux works.
What should it be?
CD is another method of knowledge representation like Semantic net and other methods that we've seen so far.
And that was an expert system which is being used in commercial domain.
There is something called Soft Computing.
We need an additional thing in solving an AI problem called search .
It just looks from all possible state states that you can generate, we will only choose some of them, we will not choose all, will choose only few and plausible better moves compared to others.
We just state that for progression, it should the move the action should make the state more relevant for the final state and less for the start state, exactly opposite while you come back.
For example, five children of the same parent, same pair of parent are very different from each other.
Now this is only about one source, one destination and you will have to do this for all destinations and from those destinations to all other nodes.
Expert utilization is given the highest priority.
Okay last three requirements.
In sigmoid, will continuously increase because if you want to get one actually, it is sigmoid will output value between zero and one.
We will just see that soon.
And when you invoke that script, the complete information available in that script is inserted into the representation.
So, that's precisely what is happening here.
So the call here is is current state zero current player.
So, if that exists then this structure cannot be the the the real one, so that is eliminated.
I do not want to highlight the other part of how to represent a statement in a very, very complex way.
okay When we look at the function I'll again remind you that place.
So, there are some parts of the script we have already seen, the first one is entry conditions.
So that is the earlier case plus the decrement.
The primary job the the job of an ant is to find the food source, nothing else.
In this case, the first level you have one node, second level you have two, next level you have four.
C grain, not grain S chicken, not chicken D is grain, not grain, okay .
But then, CD is not the panacea.
Okay .
But believe me, in when you write the program, the program may try futile paths and probably be embarking on the right path.
For example, how the navigator represents the problem itself moving across ?
So the process is to like to go to the goal state as near to goal state as possible and once we reach to the nearest possible case, we apply static evaluation function, see what it offers and based on that we find out what the parent offer and parent to parent and all that.
Now you know, there are multiple solutions and you prefer better solution.
So, you say that Milkha Singh PTRANS himself, okay .
So, again out of that five you pick up first five and so on.
It has some small set of system calls sixty three and any command that you type actually is converted to some form, some combination of those system calls to get the job done.
Okay , let us try to understand the process which it derived from.
Now, it clearly indicates that six,zero,two is better than others.
Genome contains something called chromosomes.
So, that is one of the very, very important part of prototype, this thing and expert and knowledge engineer sit together and do lot of things.
You you just try in that direction, could not solve the problem, come back and try some other direction, that is quite possible.
So, there are a few thumbs of rule, the knowledge segment should be as small as possible and they should contain knowledge chunks in a way that conventional law of cohesion and coupling is maintained.
It says noding for NF, is a new node which is defined, NF.Path is equal to NULL Now, why the path is null?
So, you can use one which suits you.
Here I have shown one example of again I'll pick up our own eight five three gallon water jug problem and I've shown how two paths are explored in parallel.
So there are some ways of telling which moves are better compared to others.
We have not provided any logic for it. Okay , suppose we have a choice.
So, the the very statement does not contain anything about bullet or gun or something but but the representation contains them.
And logic also is required, how how who changes that?
For example, one is PTRANS because the location of stone is changing.
The the algorithm, it begins with generate a random node from a state space.
So here it it’s very similar to human being or even living forms.
You just say that current state is the start state.
I have already told you in the beginning that GA is quite complex so everything that we are talking right now is basically the simplest thing that we can talk about but in true sense it is it may be pretty complex. Okay .
But anyway, the final, once you do this, you'll have to test whether the plan is perfect or not.
If it is not, we can run in parallel, you can start.
And suppose, if my heuristic function says that eight,zero,zero's heuristic value is minus five; six,zero,two is five; three,five,zero is three and three, two, three is four.
If after a move, I have the peace advantage I’ll more number of pieces than the opponent has, I have a piece advantage.
On CD is a precondition for the action okay place on top CD.
Now, you can see that, what does that mean?
There has to be it has to model the the thinking model of the opponent and then match with it and that's going to be very, very hard.
In a nutshell, it it is defined like this.
If missionary is zero cannibal can be one or two, okay clears nose .
Now, that is some something  else which we are not discussing right now, but Constraint Satisfaction also is pretty simple to understand.
And empty i,j j minus one, in fact that's the next block.
The basic approach is also decided whether you will use goal-directed reasoning or forward reasoning or whether you will use inference at this place or not, and so on so forth.
So I'll start exploring the other route.
So, that’s precisely what we've done in this chapter in this module.
So, all in all, we are going to see how heuristic function is applied in in other search methods.
And and in fact, when you represent concept like love, the same thing probably would happen, you may say that that something happened which makes the mental state equal to ten or something.
We’ve cheated actually and just instructed the program to choose rule number one .
There are in in other words there are three layers of inputs but two layers of weights.
We are going to look at a particular version of that algorithm in in a pseudo code form to understand it clearly.
What does it do?
You can see that other two things are already done C is on top of D it’s already there and D top of table.
Okay , and the the rule number five also talks about statement that we’ve looked at in the previous module.
Okay .
It's also possible for you to answer question based on this cause effect relationship because this is precisely what scripts are talking about.
So, it's basically the first step in the development process.
That's point which I wanted to stress.
I’ve already told you, when you explore a search tree or a graph, the difference between search tree and a graph is, a a graph will a child will have a point that is quite possible that will also point to a parent.
So this is an example of how you can use scripts to get answers using this cause effect relationship and there is one problem.
And what we do is we just apply kind of a generate and test.
Sometimes, all all possible combinations are entered in the goal stack and you try using all of them and get the best out of it, that also is possible.
For example, one more capability of gene gene is to make sure that you you will have some characteristic for example ability to climb trees and swim and so on.
And otherwise the M one minus M, now total number of missionaries on the left hand side is zero then it is fine.
W two zero one means the weight between the zeroth or the first hidden unit to the output unit one, remember.
But it is assumed to be there.
You can also write a formula.
Now that is a pretty complex problem and that is where this power of computation, power of the technique resides.
The opponent is not playing so we’ll choose the best.
This one is possible to be done in the other way, which I'm not going to talk about right now.
So the project is designed.
Now you can even compare that with neural networks that you have seen in the previous module.
For example, in a case of chess, branching factor is huge thirty-five.
When I'm doing it?
Let let me talk about how they find the shortest path.
A Simulated hill climbing is a method where sorry simulated annealing actually. Simulated annealing is is basically a superset of hill climbing that we've seen in the earlier module which allows some random movements in in the other direction.
We also have lot of other states where the problem can be in , Okay .
Now, you can find that this information provided in this statement is something which is different than the the script itself.
And now what I do?
And then we have seen the branch and bound search which looks at the the minimum value that we have found so far and keep a track of the new search path.
the new generation is going to replace the old generation in this case.
And we expect artificial neural networks to exhibit that characteristic.
But anyway this branching factor is an important point in the search process, Okay .
So anyway we are not going to discuss much about what it has done, we'll we'll see the introduction of GA .
These are is is is present in the image.
A good chess player would look at other things.
So out of minus five, two, minus one and minus two, two is the best node.
So, this is an example of rule number seven.
Is almost a replica of the previous rule.
I'm not bothered about the sign right now but because I'm not worried about five or minus five, I worried about the child which returns that.
Sparse neighbourhood gives you less number of nodes.
This is not better than the current one so we’ll not move.
We are showing the last city, right now we will not be showing it in other slides.
So that's not easy.
So, these are very simple goal stack planning
B is fox or not fox.
We have already seen the chess representation, the matrix representation and the the move representation.
So pick up the first city at random and solution city is that city, then pick up the nearest neighbour of that at that, there is no neighbour exists then return with the solution list, so that that means all the cities are explored and so on, okay .
Unfortunately, I cannot use my queen to capture the knight because my own piece is sitting in between.
What does that mean?
Okay. If I say three , I have many more.
Then we have seen how to use a predicate act.
Like from four you can go to three also or two also or one also, but with some probability.
And remember, we have chosen six plies in our example based on many things.
So, while coming back, you look at two things: the prerequisite okay .
So, that's the point here.
So the first string initial path is pasted with the later path of the second string, second strings initial path is pasted with the later path of the first string.
Because opponent is not going to play that.
Unlike Depth-first search where you try going in the left until you are stuck, here we have an artificial limit.
Important.
It works this way and we get quite accurate measurement.
If you pass the complete value up and the graph is shown in the next slide, you can see that there's not much of a difference.
okay .
Now you can see in this particular case, minus three, two, one and three, all four of the nodes are explored .
Placing it there on the in B it is good because I I can have two possible options, the last column and the diagonal line.
So, that does not mean it does not mean that this is the right way of doing it.
That's the idea of CD .
So, I I followed a a typical order that suits my this thing .
What we want is we want much larger value, the summation should be beyond , it should be far from zero in a way that later on if some weights are reduced it will still be more, so it will still be able to recognize that image of your friend.
So when they are coming back from E, again they find the obstacle.
If you teach a student how to draw A and recognize A, any sized A he should be able to recognize later, so that is called generalization.
Basic brain neuron is roughly divided into three parts, one is called Dendrites, which is basically an input device, something which provides input to the cell, the the nucleus of the neuron which which has a long cord which is called Axon and which again it is distributed in small tiny threads okay .
Because the partial part is Okay copied and then the mapping of that is used in crossover, let us try to see how it works.
Let us look at okay , the rule number one, moving from left to right.
Now how it processes?
The outcome of this whole conceptualization process then now you can write an exact problem statement of exactly what you're going to do and how and a detailed form, okay , that you're going to have this knowledge structure where this this rule is fired, you will get this and so on and so forth.
Fine might require fine tuning in in long run.
You might be surprised that what is it like and when you represent health equal to minus ten and ten it doesn't really represent the the the mental state of a person.
So, they are they are represented here.
That’s called local maxima.
The last but one level where which level it is?
There are few rules there and also the way one can represent a complex statement into CD .
I I just said a few times, a processor that’s a this is a processor learning, what exactly is a process?
So, that's a precondition you can't do that.
I’ll try exploring all possible cases until I get one.
Now the tour child A begins from E, C, B, G, A, F and D Okay .
For example a case of D, okay .
In this particular module, we have looked at some of the unguided methods.
The algorithm chooses one out of those cases.
Pick up the next node and refine solution with that node, calculate the total distance to be covered.
But here the difference is much larger and much bigger.
So, that also is possible.
So our goal is not achieved if you do it this way.
It deviates from that script and and that's why many things described in the default format of the script does not happen.
Sigmoid because it is continuous, it is possible to differentiate and differentiation is very required.
So we are going to discuss about how we can browse through the graph, the search tree that is generated for any game, how we proceed and how we find a move which is the best move for us.
The second one.
I'm exploring one more child of I, after I explored P.
It is about using domain knowledge, Okay .
Progression is about moving further in the state space towards the goal.
So this is these
Now the beauty of choosing these value can be seen in the next three next two statements.
For example, if you say that I'll I’ll bond the DFS for four levels and if you get answer, the difference between the optimal solution and the solution that you get is not more than 3.
So what you do is,
What does that mean?
And you can see that the source is Sachin, the destination is Sarfaraz.
Please remember to write M one equal to zero, otherwise you cannot solve this problem.
See the left most node which is already explored.
If there is a model behind this decision process, that model is to be explicitly specified, that this is the decision-making process if else and all that if so.
Usually the randomness allowed is more in the initial part of the search process and less in the lesser part of the search process.
We don't have something which can really represent love.
For example, two student frames are almost everything, same except the values of the attribute.
So, it's not that this is the primitive, these these are the primitives or this is the list.
Okay . We have already seen some domain knowledge.
If you try, for example, try to find a node with a value, for example, if you’re exploring the search space containing all integers you'd like to find out an integer where the square of the integer and the cube of the integer is same and you continue exploring that, you’ll never get an end to it.
DFS may not get you an optimal solution.
For example , let us again take that solutions search method of mi...missionary cannibal problem.
And you you may pick up two, three or four best and then again you expand them and so and so forth.
You can see that this search process is jittery obviously and I’ve told you the reason for it.
I’ve already told you ten is the solution, Okay , so that’s why it’s called hill climbing.
We are only going to talk about legal moves right now and not complicate the matter for writing moves for winning.
So, those XJ and WJ are multiplied okay .
There is no ISA relationship okay .
We also have rules or moves which can move the problem state from one valid state to another valid state, Okay .
You start with the solution, and then continue refining that solution.
Done.
The first we have already seen.
The other example is is one more of my student who used neural networks to find out best set of motivational strategies for employees.
This is called hill climbing.
One is how will if you have a move, which controls the center, it is better than other moves.
Well, we'll actually going to see and find out how how useful it is for solving a travelling salesman problem.
There are a lot of others, for example, run, that’s fly is also an example or drive is an example of PTRANSING , changing location, but there are other things associated, these verbs are are little more complex.
Who will choose it?
You may have to also think that.
In that case I'll be able to figure out exactly which move is better and which move is not.
Once you do that, all possible tours are provided to agents and they travel on all tours and they do change and all that eventually they’ll converge to the best path.
And I've already told you that it is shorter paths are preferred and there is a PPT which talks about that and what I’m I've already told you the other thing, that if there is some change in the path, the optimal path changes.
There's something called plausible move generator.
It's exactly similar to a leaf node and it's treated exactly in the same fashion which is which is the next state in in the game itself.
Robot is is a very important applications of AI.
That again is not very good, because something we want to move towards start state but we are deleting something which is part of the start state and we are also adding something which is not part of the start state.
So I have five different children.
Then in the next cycle what we do is in fact, Depth Bound Depth-first search, actually explores everything like the previous case and then it starts looking for the solution like this. You can see that.
We have seen unguided search methods.
But the knowledge, we don’t really know how it is being done because it is encoded in form of weights, that’s why it is called the black box of reasoning.
It provides fault tolerance.
You probably have come across some cases where there is a typical bit which is set for something.
In fact, that’s the reason why in many cases what you’re supposed to do is to for example, you’re exploring chess and after six levels you cannot explore seven, it is too much for you and you choose one node.
I'm I’m having two consecutive Xs in line so the next move I can win.
Now, this is a statement that you you probably encounter reading, okay , now here the meaning that CD gets out of this is that Purochan tries to do something which reduces Pandavas health and that actually is is is very, very important representation, because it it it involves something which is a question mark.
So, that's the problem.
Remember the idea.
And for example, we’ll take a missionary cannibal program problem.
So that is possible.
Is it a valid state?
So you can see how it works here.
So, is there is no match here.
So, multiple ants are travelling on all possible paths laying their pheromone along the path and in fact in in case of a program it doesn't start laying pheromone immediately.
So, the many researchers did many develop many artificial neurons.
And we have seen how one can write the state space.
We have already seen that.
It begins with root node as a start node.
There are many other ways in which you can represent this algorithm.
Again , we reach to the final level, so we’ll not move further, we’ll take the right child of it, it is 8,0,0 it is repeated.
There are few heuristic search methods that we’ve seen in this particular module.
So, here you can see that there was no mention of bullet or or or or the gun, but it is it is there in the representation.
What's the difference here?
If you look at the next figure TSP with refinement search titled image, you can see that you will get distance between every node to every other node and that is also depicted as a table, as a distance matrix, okay .
As I said, when if you stack up somewhere, the alternate path is going to be useful and the example that I'm going to talk about is called Speech translation problem.
If I cut and paste them what will happen, I will have two cities, the same city is appearing twice in the route which is not correct and some cities do not even appear, so that is not acceptable.
If you pick up some other strings you probably have different mapping and you will have to do it.
When to reduce?
We start with an initial state and reach to the final state.
Component, its weight component, its weight component its weights.
So let us first of all begin with deep breath the state space definition that we we already have on on the slide.
does crying means tear tears coming out of eyes?
Not always we learn that way.
Next important thing is to verbalize this knowledge.
Remember we have looked at Tic Tac Toe problem last module and we have labeled some of the states as W,L and then we have also had draw, okay .
Okay . In next case well explore all hundred and explore only first five, okay .
With that note, we'll end this module.
Now, looking at this description, let us see whether this particular state, whether these states are valid or invalid.
They are not using square function as it is.
It is indicating time.
There’s the other slanting line which moves from left to right down and the other one which is horizontal.
So default when default thing do change when the sequence is not observed when the statement indicates that the normal default sequence is is is not observed it disturbed somewhere.
It will travel A, B and C and now travelling towards now when they reach to that obstacle, they have two options.
And what you do is you pick up a better node.
In this module we'll we'll only mention that.
But as I said, it is not necessarily a drawback, as it is going to help which nodes to be explored in the next class, next iteration.
But there is no other relationship okay .
But then there is a difference.
Is it part of the start state?
The conceptual dependency is little better way of doing that, where we have lot of restriction on the type of links that we can have, type of nodes that we can have and how they can relate to each other, making it a very, very strong knowledge representation technique.
But the other case which we’ll we see next is that something happening and using which this thing is the other conceptualization.
So, there is a layer one, layer two, layer three.
And when that is that is very, very required this is the search method to go for.
In phase number one let them reach to the final this thing the city and calculate the distance, the length.
What do I mean by strong is that it it clears…it provides very, very clear meaning to our representation.
And remember, knowledge update is a critical problem and we have seen how critical that is an earlier module.
In fact, if you see the handout, I I have a complete table talking about each rule one after the other.
Now that's a difficult question. And what should it do?
In in on the screen you can see there is a simple case where I have seven different cities.
Chicken.
For example, when you say that Sachin is a cricketer, the the two entity Sachin and cricketer will have double arrow, all darkened like this, okay .
And once that is done, it becomes easier to infer, it becomes easier to translate into other languages.
Missionary M two is number of missionaries on the right-side, number of cannibals on the right side.
But when the situation becomes critical, what will you do?
And the only thing is that you represent anything that comes across, divide into pieces, and represent that thing as a very, very low-level primitives.
So, after primitives, the next thing is CD .
Why you want to go to dine?
He thought of these primitives.
Okay That's the next thing.
Okay .
So, basically T is related to that.
And a move is something which which allows you to move from one state to the other .
There is no relation of that sort.
We begin with the the leaf nodes, then start backing values up.
The second representation.
And the third one was a clever mathematical representation.
Three cases are shown on the screen okay .
We are discussing only this.
That means, it has complete connections.
We’re going to pick up a very simple problem called three-four Gallon water jug problem. Now this is also described in in a book called Elaine Rich.
Test planning, we know the experts are invited and experts are given job of writing test cases and test the system elaborately.
In our case, it's pretty simple.
It says that M one number of missionaries and C one number of cannibals are on the left hand side of the river.
So the track when you talk about a track, it talks about a particular type of that script.
One is the name of restaurant and the other is paying when you are paying it is assumed that he has followed the normal path.
In this case the action is relevant.
Now in this State-space what we do is every node represents a particular solution, a potential solution.
one of the exceptional example of Depth-first search is is used by Prolog.
And once it is completed, I go out of the stadium and all that is assumed that's called goal driven or expectancy driven reasoning that happens.
There are multiple ways of doing it.
The other one is keeping this thing as a question mark and look at the the the other statement that comes next and figure out what that placeholder is.
It says that Sachin did not go to restaurant as terrorists attacked Mumbai.
For in fact multiple verbs can be represented using the same primitive, for example, give Sachin gave his bat to Sarfaraz will have ATRANS , okay , as as a primitive.
So, the network becomes little big, pretty complex but the process is going to be the same.
So, I’ve I’ve numbered them that way.
What if it is more ?
It just it uses a simple agent.
You you you leave solutions which are not optimal, you choose solutions which are optimal.
Okay So that is the essence.
The Square function is sigma equal to zero to n xi yi . If it is greater than zero, it fires, less than zero, it doesn’t. Okay , is is very simple. If you draw a graph of it, you will be able to see that it is basically
What you need is support planning, how you do it, okay .
But once he put it on paper and in the the form as well as the report, expert will go through it and realize that this is the mistake and they may modify it there and then and that's the reason why KE should put everything that he knows into this thing the conceptualization.
Here the example is Nobita ate rice with a stick.
How to do that in in a computer program Okay is very important and that's what is is done by in in scripts and Schank and and the other researchers extended that idea of CD into scripts to represent such statements which does not only only represent a single information single conceptualizing but sequence of conceptualization which includes many, many more things actually.
So, that's why we are learning about this, Okay .
We'll explore we’ll expand the search tree as much as we can.
And usually, it most of the neural networks use three layers but the recent trend is to use many, many layers, hundreds of layers.
I give you a simpler problem to solve.
How have you come to know that this move , the set of moves is complete which is going every move that we need is is possible to be be fetched from this thing ?
But there is one more way.
Now, there is something different.
I just find out a mapping Okay , element in parent two and find out the position of that element in parent one, so D is at the position of four.
Now, there are two different set of weights, okay .
A lot of long back in even long back in Sixties, computer scientists who were working on such problems understood that these problems are different, they are not similar problems.
Look at this.
You can see that everywhere there is a white cell, we have zero, everywhere there is a black cell, we have one.
People have done it, but it's not going to be easy .Okay .
What is the branching factor?
Look at the next slide that.
Okay , we have already seen in in this particular module, we have seen two problems, trivial problems .
That ‘slash’ indicates this conceptualization is negated, means this thing did not happen.
If it is the case , they are going to eat missionary and this is something which we do not want.
’ Okay , now this is the description provided.
So, the point is inputs are flowing in the forward direction, the errors are flowing in the backward direction.
Begins with eighty-one, has nine into nine total inputs.
And on the right hand side you have tilde Fr means not Fr, farmer is not, okay .
I just skip that and I'm not skipping one path, I'm skipping many paths, because after D there may be nine branches.
A, we have started with A, now we reach to A and the cycle appears okay We'll stop this process and copy the rest of the elements as it is, so so A, okay the cycle.
So when you reach three it is dead end, you you won’t go further.
So, but you may ask, let us keep it like this, so it will immediately bump up and learn, no.
In fact, what you can do apply is additionally called branch in bound, Okay .
You can’t represent that in the state space.
Now, it is a little different.
Because, we are moving it.
State space is basically an enumeration of all possible states that the problem can be in.
Again, we calculate both of them place on top table place on top BA and addition, remember action is towards this.
How can you represent the sorrow?
But goal stack planning is basically this - inserting components in in a stack and one after the other continue solving them.
The function which gets me that is called neighbourhood function.
‘Anjali cried’.
They are called script headers, the the the props, the roles, the actions and if you find that, Okay , mentioned in the script in the statement, the script is invoked.
Thanks.
For example, we look at essays and decide that this is a good essay and this is a bad essay.
And there are lot of problems like recognizing a face, recognizing a signature.
We will see which crossover methods that we are going to use.
So twenty will happen for first five iterations then reduce by two so, so on so that that is what it stores.
This is obviously simple.
So that kind of a thing will will happen with expert in this particular phase, okay .
That’s a local surrounding, Okay .
Remember, you're not going to do this thing to the level that you conventionally do, in conventional that thing you almost right pseudocodes.
So, I just provide those images as inputs to my neuron and those inputs and I pick up some random weights, the wei wei ...weights are multiplied with the inputs and the summation is generated.
And I want to get the shortest tour.
Now you can see that if I only label like winning losing this draw.
Now look closely at this representation of eight five three gallon water jug.
A script is appropriate when script is really fitting in that statement and not always it is possible for us to judge and there are some examples provided in the handout.
So, when you want to represent act inflicting the state change, you will have to use this.
Suppose if you have four possible moves okay B,C,D any you can get either of them.
You may test it, Okay .
The other one, which one of my student did in his project, is is, he was working for a place where lot of resumes flowing in daily.
For example, if you get a statement called ‘Jay went to watch a match and he was very happy’ you can conclude that he was happy because the exit condition says that if the team has won he is happy.
See earlier we had a problem.
Okay , Why?
W and N you choose W and so on so forth.
And and this again has default information.
okay So, let us move on.
So, these are called dependencies and dependencies are part of CD .
And once you decide those differences, those differences are added on the stack and you just pick up the first different, find out which action is suitable to remove this or eliminate this difference and provide that.
So, this this Axon is basically an output device.
The set of genetic information is encoded in human genome.
That is shown in the next rule.
They they contain forty six chromosomes and that is twenty three pairs of chromosomes found in the nucleus of each cell, okay , the forty six chromosomes are found.
An interesting thing is if you look at the shape of both functions, if positively classified, correctly classified value, for example, for your friend, the output should be greater than zero and you get zero point one .
Twelve million rules! Think of it.
Assume that robot is moving around in in a room.
So that’s exactly what is happening here.
So, one way to do that is to use a state space representation and that's exactly what we are going to do, next.
Okay And you have output units.
One of the great things about CD is that it becomes language independent once you convert the statement into CD .
H one H one W one J, H one W two J and so on.
Number of missionaries should be more or equal to number of cannibals on either side of the river.
We’ll again start with 8,0,0.
The prototype is analyzed on technical grounds.
okay The only point left out so far in this particular discussion, what will be the first call?
And, whenever it is it is possible when the goals are interdependent, suppose you want to solve a problem which un-solves some other problem. If that happens you just test and if it is the case the which is unsolved is again inserted in the goal stack and again solved.
There is nothing which describes the fox to be farmer to be on one side or the other.
When the temperature value is less, less probability of moving to a bad move.
We have already seen number of missionaries must be greater than or equal to number of cannibals.
That again you might probably think. You already have intrusion detection system.
The difference here is is about the the application of heuristic function nothing other than that.
Not farmer.
So, what Purochan is trying to do?
So, once it finds that thing similarities it doesn't need to worry because it's there in the start state, it is also there in the end state you don't need to change them.
Why we want to avoid the cycle? Let me repeat, we do not want to continue further.
If the array is empty then report failure.
Extensive plan to help user out from any problems encountered, playing working with expert system also is to be charted out.
You require multiple interfaces.
It it first, it begins with similarities and differences between start and goal states.
We don’t really know how these weights encode the knowledge, but somehow at the end these weights are able to recognize signature, finding out the who the person is in the image and so on so forth.
One way to do it is this.
But that's a pretty hard part of the state space representation and solving problems using state space.
Instead of picking up one rule and find out if this node is better, what it does is explores everyone and pick up pick up the best one.
In this particular module, we looked at conceptualization, prototype construction, then we've looked at formalization, then we have looked at the implementation and then we have looked at the testing part of the expert system design.
Okay .
Now carefully look at how the solution is achieved.
We have seen what AI is and we have seen how to represent problems using state space and we have seen how to search .
You may convert this representation a little better representation by looking at the context later.
Now the first thing we have to do, is to write the state space of it.
So it is huge amount of time that is required.
Testing is again as I said a very, very critical part.
The neural network should not only recognize my system my signature but should which I already presented or should not only recognize the image which is presented in the database but should also be able to recognize some other image of the same person and that is called generalization.
The resources, for example, X-ray machine and deep inspection.
So, if you use a breadth first search you are likely to get the solution much faster.
It has to have more number of components and sort of capability to decide what what the opponent is thinking.
So, that's precisely describing our requirement.
Now is it a good thing to have?
Here, we can change this, we can actually mimic this by changing the program itself, the way we could.
But it is basically mutation is never considered good in humans but in here in this case, mutation sometimes is used for there is a reason and is very similar to something that we have seen in this thing ,
There is no In fact, there is no input unit, there is no hidden unit, there there is nothing which you you it is called single layer perceptron.
And throw and kick as I've talked about also involves involve moving a body part, the other one is called MTRANS , mental transformation, something where the the mind is involved.
okay , So, and you can see that bullet and all that is already there.
Anyway so humans can do it but when computers are to do it, they have to convert the problem is to be converted into state space like we've done and and and we'll have to find out the rule and apply that rule and again if there are multiple rules, you’ll have to arbitrate somehow and get the right rule to apply.
And that's why we have to provide number of images, okay .
Just compare them.
Until you reach to the cycle you copy from parent one, once you reach you copy from parent two.
Please understand opponent has two options.
For example, W one zero one means a weight between zeroth input unit to first hidden unit.
But remember if this exploration one of the parameter of exploration is the criticality of the game.
We’ll be looking at one or two very very powerful algorithms of using neural networks, okay .
Though it it sounds a wasteful at the first sight where you’re exploring the tree again, it saves on memory as well as if we’re using heuristics with it, it is possible to choose better moves in the next cycle.
And the solution basically is is a method of starting from initial state, move around in state space using legal moves and reach to a final state.
Okay .
This is the only slide which contains those names, they are all not that important for us as right now, but if you're trying to dealt deeper into GA later, probably you need to learn more about them. okay .
You may use the better represent.
That way.
I I have to be hungry, and I have to have money.
Hopefully the summation will be less than zero now.
So, then that's not the right way.
Remember why we are exploring multiple players?
This is the current state, the start state.
not all experts agree on either components, neither the weights.
Okay , the first rule says X Y Z.
In in these trivial cases, we only need a two value vector and a three value vector, three integers only.
In in the previous modules, we have seen how can one define a State Space, how can one define and so and so forth.
I was reading about an expert system which had twelve million rules .
Now, what is delta tau T plus one?
So we are not going to explore that further, Okay .
It starts with one, Okay and then again start, have two levels of tree and then again start have have the three levels of tree and so and so forth.
With this, I would like to end this particular module.
ok The current state, every time I have to take a move, the current state is given to the algorithm.
It is possible to represent a problem in two different ways.
For example, there is a bowler who is very tall, Irfan who is is pretty tall.
So the complete scenario is is is assumed once I state that.
They are called I’m I'm calling them other search methods some in fact we are going to have one more module after that which we are we are going to discuss some typical search methods.
It’s that simple.
For example, if I want want to find out minimum between one three and five, then I is minus one minus three and minus five.
So, you'll have to get some consensus on it if you have a team of experts.
SEF returns the winning chances for player one, not player two.
and if it is so they they use their smelling and hearing ability to figure out if they are nearby and at the first sight of the enemy around they start running.
And complete action many a times cannot be solved by one action so it generates new goals and places there.
Why it is called steepest ascent?
So if you have fox and grain on one side, absolutely no problem.
So, we had M one before.
Or the other example is that I that I've also listed in the handout is that we went to Osho’s eatery when we went to Mandvi, and we enjoyed our dinner there.
Now that’s something which is an advantage of Depth Bound Depth-first search.
So you you can always, once you explore that entire tree you can apply heuristic and find out which moves are better compared to others.
So, if a an ant has found a food source, if other ant is looking for a path there is high probability that the other ant chooses the same path.
Unguided Search is used at two cases, there is not enough domain knowledge, we don’t know, Okay .
You will have to find some other way.
You can see 3,5,0 is the next one, 0,5,3 is the next one, 3,5,0, now that’s the dead end.
You know Google Maps it’s using the Google Maps Google Car is using Google Maps but how will you represent that?
In case number one there I can play and you can see the bold face X is our movement if I place in case of A it is little better because B is not very good because the third space is already occupied and playing elsewhere is not also very good.
But you can see I've already told you that this method is actually an extension to our Breadth First Search or hill climbing.
What is bike?
And when you talk about scripts, when they are invoked, those default things are overridden by by the information that is provided in the script.
Not only that king will have a value which is more than the total of all the values of all other nodes, all other pieces.
It was for possible in the single layer version.
Why it is required?
Remember we would like to remove components which are there in the start state, not in the end state.
Now this is very similar to what we have seen before.
Welcome back friends.
CD Now, this is an excellent example how CD can aid information. We already have how CD generates this structure.
It's called conceptual tense.
For example, in the case number one, we have three two, the case number two we have four four zero, is a final state.
Is it a relevant thing?
But understand that this is a very, very critical requirement for a function to be used in in in Back propagation like algorithm.
Okay , so it it it looks simple on the face of it, but it is hard.
For example, if you're playing chess, you wont look at all possible moves, you only look at some which are good, which are which are better compared to others.
You also have to have some kind of performance assessment system.
And here, Farmer Fox Chicken Grain problem.
In fact, when there is the rule is pretty specific, the prerequisites are pretty specific, simple.
We have looked at two important points: progression and regression.
You've already seen in semantic net that we we can represent the natural language statements using some links and some nodes.
So, this is not a relevant move.
We have seen six different options possible for a Tic Tac Toe case and you will have to evaluate those cases to figure out exactly what is static evolution function’s value.
Okay .
You can see that it is not C is not resting on the table.
It is again pretty simple.
Now here, please understand, there are two different problems.
Look at that, X Y where X belongs to four zero, sorry zero four and Y belongs to zero three . So any value between zero to three, any value between zero to four, is something that you can write.
Voice recognition systems and face detection systems and there many, many similar systems used in practice which, in sense using back propagation algorithm.
Thank you
Now it is impossible for the speech translation program to go back and try other because it has to be continuously translating everything that the person is speaking.
We’ll not explore complete game trees in most cases.
That also assume one more thing that I was hungry, Okay .
So, some information about Deep Blue is provided.
Yeah .
Because if I for example I say that any two children that is going to be huge , not only that any number of changes, I have a huge value.
I'll have only ten different children.
Obviously the knowledge base processing comes next.
So, these things are important.
Now ride is an act, okay .
So what people do it they do it empirically and find find out.
This is precisely what we want and the boat moves on the right side.
So second cycle.
We can say that this row , we call it w zero , so it is basically and we can take it on the left side of the equation, what we have is x one, w one, x two w two at the end minus w zero greater than zero , then it is firing, less than zero, it is not firing, or output one or zero.
One more thing is that it’s capable of using looking at fuzzy things and manage.
So, that is something which is there, but you can see that additionally with a friend.
So, that part is done here.
Even while they are they are grazing they they they keep on hearing the sound and looking it around to make sure that there are no carnivorous animals around
‘Crying’ means tears coming out of eyes.
So, when it is represented in in CD , all other statements are added all these objects which are implicitly mentioned are added.
okay So, if you write a mathematical equation and when you are representing a real world, this is something which is tricky.
But then the transfer of of ownership is is from Sachin to Sarfaraz and that is important here.
The beta release is given to the the customers, the usual customers and their feedback is taken and then you release the final product.
For example, in chess, there are many heuristics possible.
Now G is to be mapped to D.
So, we we look back at our own that thing and and we’re we very happy to learn that our logic is still there, we dig that thing out and put that thing into the code and that worked.
So, when there are many other cases.
It's very hard for me to decide whether this value is very, the estimate is very correct or not.
It is possible to encode it actually
So, you can see there are four steps shown on the slide which which does just that okay , and just go back.
How to get them is a hard problem.
X Y Z greater than zero or equal to zero, where we don't have negative values, X less than or equal to eight.
It says that the farmer is on the right hand side and at L Fx which is not says that fox and chicken cannot be there together on the left side and chicken and grain cannot be together on the left hand side.
So, that is one way of doing it.
That's a restriction.
Basically, ant colony optimization is about learning what others are doing and and learning to solve problems like them.
Current state zero current player means, current state is the state, on on which the MiniMax is applied.
So, you just apply static evaluation function to B, C and D.
The breadth first search we replace by branch and bound in all cases.
Sachin gifted a bat to Sarfaraz, also will have that.
Are they same?
If missionary is one cannibal can be one or zero.
Obviously, when any spaces have to live and and when the condition is that the resources are limited they will have to fight for the survival.
So, we'll be talking about that.
Conceptual roles are are also very important.
So, the the backing up value happens in the inverse order.
It's kind of a draw.
An interesting exercise that you can pick up and the try out is - Can you write a single rule converting these two rules into one?
Now look at the example shown on the screen, it it has a goal state and has a previous state.
Even today it is being so.
So okay , so that's how it it learns?
So, I I won't spend time talking about this.
Now I will trim anything which is less than twenty-two because I already have a solution which can provide me twenty-two.
For example, if you use a heuristic function called H which for a better move gives a higher value of heuristic function.
Given a solution state, I can actually generate multiple solution states from it.
Now implementation planning is basically how you're going to implement this, deciding about the the classes and all that.
Now the rest is to be picked up from other parent, that means child one will have other cities from parent one and child two will have city cities from parent two, Okay
But that is precisely what we’re supposed to do and that’s the theme of this chapter.
In fact for travelling salesman problem the fitness function is pretty simple, the total distance covered negatively is the fitness function. okay .
Whatever is added and you have interact section with the goal state and if this is phi that means you have added many things with nothing is part of the goal state it’s a fruitless exercise, it should not be phi.
The next one is propel.
So six is a dead end in this case.
I can actually try sparse neighbourhood by just assuming a a case where two adjacent cities are being exchanged.
Whenever we encounter that word, we'll take that form out and we'll just use placeholders from the statement.
So, that that is one of the important parts of the formalization.
And using this method actually many other problems are also solved.
This is precisely what this particular statement says.
The first difference is that the neuron is very slow, it operates in the range of milliseconds or processors operate in the range of nanoseconds.
Yes, we can do it because we only have seven cities here, we'll we'll be able to do it very easily.
Okay , we’re only taking a small segment of this thing .
Okay Multi layer neural network which anyway, I I discussed about that in the previous module and we are going to study that thing really more detail in this particular module.
There is something wrong.
And I've told you in the previous module, the best approach to design an expert system is to build a very simple prototype, and recursively modify it to represent or convert to the final system, that's the best approach.
And DNAs are replicated in the offspring,
Corresponding element of H is C and C appears at position number three, so they that is added Okay you can see; a position that appears in child one now. Okay .
Yes.
okay number of missionaries, number of cannibals, great! they are they are still three.
And maximum is it is three and two are lesser value.
You can see that in the third one also you have a cycle.
it should be null, it should be phi.
Now, let us begin the exploration of the algorithm itself, the MiniMax algorithm.
In fact, every level you will be exploring one node for more than every the total number of nodes that you’ve explored even in the case where you have a binary tree.
cough The rule number sixteen talks about an attribute of an actor and the actor himself, that relation.
Now, you can see that there is a deviation which clearly indicates that watching a match does not happen.
The beauty of representing things into using script is that it can help you learning about sequential and causal relationship because the agents act in sequential fashion, Okay , like buying tickets and then going inside the stadium and so on so forth.
So how it is done and you can probably will understand by this figure.
Great!
In this particular module we’ll be talking about syntactical rules about the conceptual dependency representations.
okay , and you will have to have plans, various plans for but design, as I said is not as detailed as the conventional one, is usually kind of ‘let it evolve’ kind of situation here.
Thank you!
Okay so that the next condition represents that.
I'm guaranteed to get minus three or more.
There is something called dead end also.
So, we’ll come across this once again.
I consider it to be part of AI at least the initial part GA was quite associated with AI .
okay , that's the initial state.
Basically, the goal state will give you action.
So, that is the best place to move.
As I said, this over function might check many things, so we're we have not written this function, we've only called this function with two values - current state and current player.
Instead of using the same heuristic function, you use some other route.
So, whenever an electrochemical signal arrives at neuron, the the dendrites will capture that, send that thing to the nucleus, the nucleus process process is that and then send it across over Axon.
Now three. Okay .
We'll see the examples of all of them soon.
And what is the amount of memory that you need?
These are used today.
The inputs come from this side and flows through this layers and then goes out from the last layer.
Now, if there is a local minima, local maxima whatever, when it is moving around and it falls into local minima or climbs up local maxima, it cannot go forward.
Difference between this winding and unwinding phase is, winding phase if you call f-one and then again the next call and a third call, so winding part happens first here, then here, then here, then here normal conventional case.
Because you're hungry, so that precondition is added. It also adds that we went inside Jungle Book we were seated, we ordered all that everything is added. Okay , so when we encounter such statements, a series of statements are represented and inserted and that's called invoking a restaurant script.
So, point is I should not be diverted in in wrong direction.
In fact,I I was.
it’s more likely they travel back on the same path and it attracts more number of ants, okay .
And also chicken and grain cannot be on that side, okay .
A chess board, you can have this two states.
N inputs are presented.
So, in this particular module we will be discussing about what neural networks are in subsequent to more modules.
Eventually, you’ll run out of actions all all actions are applied at the state that we achieve is a goal state, we are done.
Ants, they’re spraying pheromone values.
Now, Sita was happy because of that, okay .
When path one is little shorter the ant from E will reach faster over that line and when more ants will be travelling on that line, number of trips that probably because of we assume that equal number of ants coming from both directions, you can see that the path one you will have more number of ants travelling and more frequently.
But beyond D you just use the heuristic to estimate the remaining path.
When knowledge is redundant, we have a problem.
So, same way D and N is the next combo and N is what it chooses.
And you again can see that there is a placeholder called ‘Do’.
So we won't have that chance.
A simple a single state space can be represented in multiple ways, a the same same way the rules also can be written multiple ways.
How can a computer program do it?
It says that A plus B plus C plus D not equal to six, twelve and four.
At minimizing layer we have two options possible winning and losing as the opponent is going to choose and we get the loss.
So, it is 0 to N okay and you what you add? You add XI WI okay .
We've seen the rules are very pretty simple, addition and subtraction.
Number of input units is decided based on the input okay , the size of file that you take for input.
For example, if you use a sparse neighbourhood you just replace to adjacent or or or exchange to adjacent city information.
And using artificial neuron they tried to solve those complicated seemingly complicated problems.
There are reasons.
And if I have large number of nodes, it's called Dense neighbourhood.
Now, you can see that these two representations happen in parallel.
okay we are looking at the prerequisites see that, Look at this.
Place on top BA dot deletion intersection SS should not be phi, it should remove something which is there in the start state which again you will see that there is something called free A which was there in the start state, now it is removed.
When we say ‘flew to LA’, we are providing additional information.
With that we end with this module.
It's based on the player as well as the state.
Simplicity is is the other issue.
What about this?
More importantly, we must understand that this is an idea how how to represent a language statement of a language using simple primitives.
We will only be able to use legal moves.
How users can communicate problems to the company, who will be responsible for handling those customers problem, what type of support staff is needed, how system configuration and implementations are handled, how domain experts are used to handle these problems and so on so forth.
cough And interestingly most of the cases entry conditions are not satisfied specified in the statement but when they are not specified in the statement, they are assumed like in the case of the earlier statements that we have encountered.
if SS is the final solution set that satisfies the the criteria that you like to achieve, is great.
Okay , if you >can represent something using a state space it is possible because we have a structured mechanism of moving around in states where starting from the initial state , use legal moves to reach to that final state.
If you look from the angle of a programmer, this requires a lot of memory and you don’t really know how many nodes are going to be explored.
We’ve seen that we we we entangled into local maxima and if we find that our children don’t have the value better than us, what should we do?
We will be discussing about Neural Networks this time.
So, this is how you can define a state space, you can have initial and final state, you can define moves and how you apply most to solve a problem.
So, these are the things which is are very important in in CD .
It’s very hard okay to write rules, debug them, and once you do that, your computing system has to choose one rule from them, pretty hard.
With that will complete this discussion on MiniMax algorithm.
Remember the heuristic value, the static evaluation function value and maximizing layer will pick up a node with maximum value and the minimum layer will pick up that by minimum value.
Eventually , what I get is three two.
Now what I do, I just copy rest as it is and what I get is this, this four, okay .
You have two white pawns here, but the lowermost pawn, you can see that the importance of it.
And the cyclic crossover, we what we do is we we pick up an element from parent one and pick up a corresponding element in parent two and pick up that element, and use that position to to store that in in the, to to copy that thing in the child and so and so forth.
And when he does that, he he himself learns about his own knowledge, okay .
There are some important differences.
After some time no ants will be travelling along path two.
When this particular process is to be terminated?
So, that person is also required.
So that data structure, it's pretty complex.
How you decide a state?
So, everything that I talked about is is is shown here.
It is basically a weighted average.
Okay , You probably have heard about professional chess playing programs and something if you if you if you read computer related information, probably you have heard about Garry Kasparov being beaten by a computer built by IBM engineers.
So you first, you begin with A now you D.
Because is already there in the original one it is copied from that.
Results are when you say that Jay Jay went to watch a match and he was ecstatic probably you can get that his favorite team has won because that the result shows result has two outputs happy and not happy, happy when your favorite team has won and not happy when your favorite team has lost.
Obviously, we are going to solve the problems, so, we'll have to decide the solution as well in the detail.
In fact it is not good, obviously because you're not exploring all nodes.
Similarly, Sarfaraz took a bat from Sachin will also have the same thing because it’s basically, essentially the same thing.
Okay , go back to next city okay .
Now that is important ‘with a friend’ okay .
So, a relevant progression moving from start space to the end state can easily be understood by having it does something which removes something which is there in start state but not in goal state and adds something which is there in the end state but not in the start state.
okay The other things are same like you can see PTRANS ‘Sachin to restaurant’.
the rule is return in a very simple programming like way.
Done.
We explore the top when we get all nodes, we apply heuristic values to them, add them in the array and again pick up that node from the top.
And you can see that the ‘reason’.
Thus it is tested this way and and that's critical part in the processing.
So, exploring next ply will require almost thirty-five percent thirty five times more than the current ply.
Well the last one, last city is always the first city.
Genetic Algorithms is is is a method of solving problems based on how life forms persist.
What we do is from current state from current state we remove additions and then add preconditions.
So, the idea is that we are the brain is capable to manage buzzy and incomplete information.
For example, in this case, Jay got bored not because security person has shown him or or tell him to stand in a queue but he got bored because he has to wait for a long period and the queues were pretty long.
But in case of A, you will almost invariably find them.
okay So, for that I I have that value and also the path from where I am connecting, what's the exact path and what's the heuristic value of that particular path.
So point is I can actually decide number of children that I'm going to have, if I'm exploring solution space search.
In fact the vertical line that you see from zero to one is is not actually indicating any input, it is just shown to make sure that you it looks like square.
Now, that is whatever is deleted is it part of the goal state?
In fact sparse and dense neighbourhood can also be applied in in conventional constructive search.
You'll have to find out the previous state from this.
Almost all AI problems what my point is almost all AI problems are harder than what you see what what what you find them at the first glance.
Next four we are not moving them.
How do we know that these rules are going to be useful for solving a problem?
Rule execution also is to be tested.
Suppose if I'm I have a bunch of states say twenty different states I and I try to see if this sequence is good enough for me to get a solution.
Obviously, because it's a longer path.
clears nose The next one is called PTRANS or physical transformation like abstract one, which was there before, okay .
Maximum maximum value of the ch...children is passed up.
X two into W one two one X three W three one.
There are so many other problems which we can talk about
The third rule is talking about a case, when Y plus Z is is less than five.
More number of ants coming from either C or E will prefer that path one and that will make it more attractive.
Okay , so the branching factor, the next thing which we’re trying to explore.
So, that is also talked about later in the slide that delta T plus one tau T plus one is basically I equal to one to N delta tau T plus one I, which is a contribution from Ith ant.
Obviously because this is the only one rule I can apply.
T is something that we use to control this probability.
What that would like to end this particular module, what we have seen in this particular module?
One is 4,4,0 and the other one is 4,1,3.
Okay , it's just the test nothing else.
But then there are some issues with using this as SEF .
You can see that Sachin is clever.
Then you take up any one of them.
So, what we have to do is wherever the xi is non-zero, one, we have to change the value of w. We have to reduce that value because we want to reduce the amount of summation.
So, the point is researchers started working in the direction of designing or mimicking human brain by providing algorithms which can work that way, and there are many models in fact.
Okay .
Now see corresponding element is B, so B is copied, you can see that B is copied again, so in child one at this point of time is A, B, C, D, next three are unknown, H and unknown.
The case number three I’m I’m is also good.
So, you may need to do that.
It is possible to generalize, in fact this method is good enough for us to generalize.
And detailed documentation is also very, very critical here.
Not better value, you generate the other children and so on, so forth.
We have not used all those rules which we have defined.
Now now you can see that that part is also quite simple compared to the previous rule this is more readable actually.
Because we’re looking at all possible nodes and we’ll pick up the node which which gives us steepest ascent, will give us highest value the heuristic value of the children, Okay .
the new generation takes place,
Okay , so, that slope can be adjusted.
I’ll be talking about that in due course.
Let us recap what we have seen in this particular module.
There is There are some its called Maxwell's equation and why it is designed?
For example when number of missionaries are less than number of cannibals you cannot accept that state.
You just lay pheromone again once you reach to the last segment, lay pheromone value again and then again start the process.
So, script interpretation resolution of ambiguity, Okay , can answer this question just because it was based on the scripts.
So, it will will never have that data loss kind of an issue.
And here okay , every this is ATRANS represents an action, transformation of ownership and it has an actor, the actor is the person who initiates that process. For example, when I say that Sachin gave his bat to Sarfaraz, Sachin is an actor but if you say that Sarfaraz received a bat from Sachin, Sarfaraz is an actor.
So, the figures, the three figures in the handout as well as the PPT clearly indicates this part.
We represent the concept and not the words and that's the power of CD .
As I said, a single conceptualization talk about a very simple, involves a single primitive.
And if the output is wrong, it floats those errors back and that's why because of this, the algorithm is known as back propagation.
Minus ten is a defeat for me, ten is a win for me and the value between minus ten to ten indicates the merit of that particular state, how good or bad that state is.
If, this is also not the case, we have multiple children.
Now, this is one very important difference.
Language has its own boundaries and the problem with that also is inherited into CD .
It can be divided into curve and round and broken and all that .
But you may do this and you will be able to get the right answer.
What is the difference?
You can see that there are now, this is only an extension to what we have seen in the earlier module.
Somebody is dead then it is called health equal to minus ten in CD .
There is a weight between X one okay , remember, the X zero and H zero look like inputs but you can see that there is no arrow going inside.
Which class is a friend of other class if you're coding in C++, there’s a concept of friend, kind of.
So, that indicator you can see a a double arrow pointing, and you can see that it is pointing to conceptualization and not the act.
8,0,0, something which is already generated.
Why chess is solved?
It is basically summation of all ants and their pheromones.
The hidden layer number of units people have worked on and decided that the best value for hidden unit number of hidden units, can be calculated by using geometric mean of input number of input units and number of hidden the output units.
I've collected all of them, from collect collected them from the papers, so you better you may read those papers yourselves.
If you do that for thirty less than anything less than thirty two, five units are good.
It is not about representing a problem in state space,no.
Let us look at what let us summarize what we have we have looked at in this module before we embark on the next module.
So, here it is different.
Remember, we have to find out maximum value in case of a maximizing layer, minimizing at at the minimizing layer.
And here, the example is watching a match which we have seen in the last module.
So, these things can be inferred though it is not directly mentioned in the script it those things can be inferred and that's the power of script.
Okay , so kind of Okay , so and I'm also using a physical force, so PROPEL is also involved.
But if you if you know how and there are some books available on how to write heuristic function for a given domain like chess.
Thank you.
Because Sita is happy because of that.
Now this is something which you should try to avoid.
okay He might also say that the system is to be redesigned because now he has learned everything and he can suggest that this is the mistake that I made and I’d like to improve on it.
For example, or or or critical cases like king is under attack, threat of fork which is basically mimicking how human player works okay , which obviously will take more time, explore more number of nodes and also look at more number of moves and also deeper.
So, it’s basically sigma xi wi where i ranges from one to n.
That is the meaning B plus F is two that means one of them is zero.
So what you can do is you can apply variable , the neighbourhood descent function.
Okay the algorithm is pretty simple.
So this temperature is actually an artificial value that we take.
Okay , my pocket for example which I I just did.
The entry conditions I have talked about the locations,People involved,object involved and the results and all that they are all all all mention in the explicitly at now which was not mention in the orignal statement okay .
We have introduced Neural Networks in this module, we have seen how brains work, the artificial neuron and then we have looked at how this artificial neuron actually can process data, we have seen how threshold value can also be used together with the other inputs and we have seen two activation functions, square and sigmoid.
Because if you see that slope okay .
It stores that information in some convenient form, which is not known to anyone of us, okay .
Now we’re not looking at the children.
We have seen three different ways of doing it.
Some cases one search method is better than some other cases, the other method is better.
Pick up the start node, it’s it’s the current node if it’s the goal, great, you don’t need to do anything.
So again in this case, though a lot of other things are mentioned script should not be invoked.
Rating an essay or rating a post.
What’s whenever when the outcome or the result is getting bored, it can write those things correctly, then it is also possible for somebody to predict why he got bored.
So it's not always be that simple.
And it in fact, for that what you're supposed to do is to derive meaning out of that statement, okay .
Here, we will be talking about progression, regression and few other things.
Okay , let us recap what we have looked at in this particular module.
If you know how to do that, does a a as I've already discussed that thing in the previous module that there is something called heuristic which can help us.
Okay .
So, readability is the other issue.
It takes two things as input.
This is called feed forward.
Whatever you do or say that I will design classes for it, I design this different types of links and so on, so forth.
In fact when we we explore the tree we we explore the tree for a case, the next case, the partial solution tree.
So longer the path less the pheromone value.
I have not written that.
So who will choose it?
The process is basically descending and not ascending like hill climbing.
There are some rules that determines how the representation takes place.
L M one M one.
If you've seen how ants find their food source, okay , how they move around and find that food source, if you have studied that process, you probably understand what I'm talking about.
Most of the commercial programs use many static evaluation evaluation function components like Deep Thought had eight thousand odd components.
There's one example shown on the screen A is resting on B, B is resting on C, C is resting on D.
We have written a function, we are of function call only.
The one more important point, one more important component of SEF is called degree of freedom.
For example, you have a color of skin which which is not inherited from either parents.
When when the array becomes empty because there is no node to explore, Okay .
Okay So and we have take taken a character recognition example.
Now thats little surprising, what variable neighbourhood could be?
The object of how Mahesh hurt Jayesh what's the object?
Why?
Static evolution function is also assumed to be existing we don't write, define any static evolution function here and we'll we'll see that there is something on alpha-beta pruning.
In normal cases you require twenty five, thirty thousand epochs.
T is temperature but not real is basically our remember it is in case of the annealing process, the physical annealing process, temperature reduction is determined based on the empirical values and their results their their experiments.
So > now look at the middle part.
So, that thats great things about life forms and the same thing we are going to have adopt in GA that is adopted in GA to solve problems.
For example, when you say that ‘Sachin gave his bat to Sarfaraz’ and when you say that ‘Sachin gifted his bat to Sarfaraz’, there is a difference between ‘give’ and ‘gift’.
So that there there are three ones listed on the slide, Okay .
So, when I represent that statement, I say that Irfan this arrow and now this is not exactly like the previous arrow.
Anyway, now you can see that there is a deviation from a normal sequence which clearly indicates that there is something wrong.
You can move in all directions.
Now what you have to do is to start from one node and send agents to all paths, okay .
Long almost twenty years, after long period somebody could find multi-layer perceptron, multi-layer neural network and could actually demonstrate that it can solve almost every problem that comes across.
So G is replaced by D. Okay .
L is the side of the river, the left side of the river.
The earlier search methods that we’ve seen are called constructive search methods.
The other one which is also quite interesting is that we we always pick up the best node irrespective of the parent value.
We just see if the the sequence is a solution,if not we’ll pick up some other sequence.
If I go on doing it, I’ll not be able to solve my problem in my lifetime.
We are going in depth, we are not exploring it, we just take a left root, left root, left root, left root. Go.
What is the consequence of it?
If my current node’s heuristic value is three, I get a node with with heuristic value five I I just move.
Solution space is okay Solution but it won’t search like other search methods that we have seen so far.
And again, what is the I value?
If it is not , you can pour everything that you can and whatever is left is is kept here.
So if you look at that array you can easily understand the children that you’re generating is already explored.
Once that is done, okay once we get that those values static evaluation function now try to understand how we learn about win, lose or draw.
This is something which we do everyday .
So, if we have reached to the player, in in the earlier case we have looked we have found that six is a an as a value for the ply.
And what are the concerns about the impa When when the system fails to detect intrusion or when the system fails to detect a disease, when the system incorrectly classifies a disease which is not and so on so forth.
Because when MYCIN did something similar, it got seventy two percent accuracy.
That that slide talks about the power of that white pawn.
So, there are many things.
If you try a Depth-first search you probably will not get.
So, here that is what we are doing.
When use GA and and on problems like this it is not easy for you to combine them by using a single point crossover like cutting the tour into half here, and cutting the other two into half and just combine them, because the cities maybe repeated and sometimes cities may be omitted, so that is not is not allowed, that is why we need little different type of crossover methods, there are three crossover methods we have seen, one is called partially mapped where a small part of one parent is copied into children and based on that mapping the rest of the elements are filled up.
All events can be added, all people not explicitly mentioned are possible to be added, all props involved are added and then the sequence of events, the default sequence of events are all added, Okay .
We have seen that.
Thank you
So, that is something that that mechanisms to store current state is very important.
One is rho, rho value of that piece.
As it started raining when he was paying, he called a cab service for returning home.
We'll see what exactly each part is doing in this particular algorithm.
So, we call them equation ten point one and ten point two which are which indicates the output generated for both of them.
Now, this is a very simple function, it outputs zero or one based on the total summation of wi xi.
Okay , for example missionary cannibal we've already I've already talked about that and this slide actually is talking about that again.
We have also seen threat of fork and degree of freedom as additional two components of for SEF .
And that happens in our manual case as well and the program is probably doing that as well.
With that we’ll conclude.
And you can also see that this is a complete network, every input unit is connected to every middle unit and every middle unit or hidden layer unit is connected to every output unit.
And, when we only have an estimate it is likely that we try in one direction, we may fail, we have to try in the other direction and so on, so forth.
Basically, what we want in neural network solution is to mimic brain, human brain.
So, you have to because A is resting on top of B.
The job of a hidden layer is is to identify features okay .
My king is under attack kind of.
The response which is generated from there because because he was threatened by Rajan.
You can have the top row or the last column okay .
In fact, a complex script will have alternate scenes if a scene af...after one scene if this happened, or this can happen we’ll soon soon see some examples of that.
The people who worked on it call it objective function. Okay .
Now there is a cause effect relationship.
When you do that in in case of refinem…this thing the branch and bound that thing is known as the refinement search.
Okay how see how it is done.
That means that I'm sending two cannibals on the other side.
The first statement that you can encounter is MiniMax, the arguments are current state, current depth and current player.
So, we we have seen some other examples earlier where we have clearly stated that this is the solution and we say that the program is going to do it that way.
You can even control that thing that that's why that method is better.
When you try solving on BA, what you need is free B which is not there okay .
So, that is called Variable neighbourhood.
Second is position.
Now whenever the other ant ants start moving, what that does it do, it looks at all possible paths and there is a high probability that it chooses a path with a higher value of pheromone.
So you pick up four, again, pick up all all children are four, five, six and four.
It is not going to allow us to win.
As I said it’s daunting for most of the cases, even our trivial case, it’s not easy.
So, this is the artificial neuron also is designed exactly in that fashion.
Not only that, for every problem which we take, there are some implicit assumptions.
The unwinding part in most of the recursive algorithm, the unwinding part is more critical because, every function contains that the winding whatever is there every function contains, whenever you have a function call made, this is a function which calls some other function.
So, when I say that I want to I went to dine yesterday, the the whole bunch of information is provided.
But when we talk about mutation is about making sure that there is some real random inheritance takes place.
There are some other representations possible as well.
And in but then inheritance involves lot of randomness.
If we’re exploring like hill climbing we’ve we’ve come to a dead end actually because three only two children minus one and minus two both of them are having less value so we’ll not be going forward.
okay .
One is called layer.
What we do is, we just get all those images, store those images in in in in the database, provide each image to the algorithm, we call it neural network algorithm or Back propagation neural network or some other algorithm.
So, that's the next thing that we are going to talk about is a method to optimize.
I MTRANS match and then the the information is coming from eyes and going to my CP , Okay .
So, I the input unit and J hidden unit, W one IJ, W two IJ is Ith hidden unit to Jth output unit.
Now what beam search is?
The prerequisites of the rule describes the conditions when the rule is applicable.
Okay .
As is already given at minus nine.
Seven minus one factorial.
All of them will start using path one and you can see that when they find path one, again it is the optimized path.
I choose top five from it,
We don't need to do anything else you can see that this is a very simple representation compared to all both of the representations before.
In this module, we have seen that how this thing is divided into layers, how the activations flow, how the values are calculated, how the weights are named.
Say what will you do?
So, we no state will have number of missionaries other than three, number of cannibals other than three, okay .
they start with a random set, evolve and combine solutions.
We're going to the previous state and look at the description that we’ve provided.
Now this part is already done okay .
Okay same way Milkha Singh ran yesterday.
Let us see.
And we are not actually showing how the variables are manipulated.
In some cases, the search space is not finite.
Now when the ants will continue travelling.
For example, you begin with a sparse neighbourhood when you stuck up, when you have a problem, when you have local maxima try dense neighbourhood and try an alternate route, okay ?
The other important thing about CD is that it captures the meaning of a statement, rather than just showing links about the words that those are used in the statement, rather than providing that superficial understanding of what the statement is about.
Because, is the opponent is going to play and there is an alternate equal I available which opponent can play which is which leads to almost defeat for us minus nine.
And it's not an algorithm.
Okay , but then there is a difference.
Many a times, the neurons appear in multiple layers.
Remember , we discussed about plausible move generator in the previous module.
If you look at the second one - deletion, intersection, the start state, that also is phi.
Let us try let us try to understand the algorithm now.
This is our probability.
Similarly, at Ith hidden unit, it shows on the screen, the only difference is that it was one, the the second suffix was one which becomes I now.
Y is the amount of milk in five gallon jug.
So, that kind of meaning can be derived out of a statement, which was not possible using any other method before and this may in fact, if the proper statements are there before this particular statement is invoked, probably the CD representation will be will be such that the the Purochan tried to burn Laksha Gruha to make sure Pandavas health becomes minus ten.
We'll talk about that.
Next one is minus four.
So, sometimes the search spaces are not finite.
So, you can look at the next slide.
okay , I can tell that your king is under attack and king has no place to move.
Second thing, if I say, show me a move .
You cannot solve the problem in real time.
Okay , now we're talking about the third case - The eight gallon jug and three gallon jug.
Three sixty different for a small problem like this only seven cities there are total three sixty tours possible.
Okay the hidden unit total N inputs are provided.
In case number one we have zero zero, both jugs are empty.
And there are two type of methods, guided and unguided.
We pick up six which is best, Okay , this is what we’re doing.
You can fill this thing and whatever is remaining you you can keep here.
You have to continuously check whether the performance of the system is improving or not.
Let us look at the first method called Partially mapped crossover.
One learns to become active and there is a slanting line moving from left to right up.
Then you can place on top BA and then you get on BA.
So you don’t add them in the explored array and that’s the reason we’re keeping that array, clear nose Okay .
GA is about representing problems in in form of a solution space.
There are many paths D to E, D to F then G and E and so on there are many paths which we are not going to look at those paths.
In fact, it is quite possible that when you take the feedback from users, they just discard it.
A B C D is farmer, fox, chicken, grain.
You can see this.
Welcome friends, to the tenth module of AI .
What does that mean?
Now A B C D is what?
And the very, very important if the expert feels so and the knowledge engineer feels so, if both of them are in sync or they are not.
You can see that the body of part describes.
So, state space has some component and the end state also or the goal state also has some components.
But you will have to actually now how that is done?
But then there is a problem.
We just assume it to be there existing.
Because if you don't do this, it’ll not have that level of acceptance in user.
We have looked at some guided, two methods actually, hill climbing and Breadth First Search in in earlier module.
And then from five I get seven, I move, a seven, eight I can move up and so on.
Let me tell you that GA is a huge thing and what I am going to talk about is just we are just going to scratch the surface.
Now again , we’ll try to explore the left child which is 6,0,2, which again runs into trouble.
Now you can see that there is a node minus three, which is explored three, which is also explored now which is being explored right now .
And if you try running this program, looking for all possible alternatives, calculating the the the the length of the path probably the program will not end in your lifetime. okay .
Opponent is going to play the minus three.
This is precisely what we are going to address in this module, how to search, how it is possible to search.
Okay , For example, we can’t move from zero zero to one zero in case number one because how will you get one zero? There is no measuring device available . You can't get that, Okay .
It is done by applying something called a heuristic function.
What are the additions?
So, the output is whether is your is the friend’s image or not.
Some presentations are simpler compared to others.
Then you cannot have fox and chicken both on the same side.
In fact, we have not stressed on one very critical aspect of state space called prerequisites.
‘First Jay went to watch the match.
In in most cases, you won’t have the luxury of having that much amount of memory to store all those nodes there.
And it can combine sequences for better and non-isolated kind of reasoning.
Those problems were quite structured, quite structured in the sense that we can define something called a start state, something called a ninth state, we can define states space and we can define rules which can let us move around in state space, moving from start state to the end state.
Now let us see how you can define rules or moves .
Okay , learning is a process which for for getting such a weight which can identify every input as correctly.
Because it's very, very hard to characterize.
It propagates the errors back.
How static evaluation function gets its value?
First of all, let us look at the basic brain neuron, okay .
So, he the translator is converting that Hindi sentence into a french sentence.
We begin with zero zero and you can see the sequence on the slide.
Suppose if I I just pick up all cities, finding out distances between them.
Now, let us look at syntactic rule number six.
If you do not want to do it, just negate it.
It tries all possible way to explore the search surface and get the the solution.
Okay
For example, all the praise the like deer, what they do?
This is because of lot of advancement in this particular field this neural network.
Dependencies also are possible to be modified using some small indicators.
Now, this is the problem .
cheu All that is done, now we are going to putting it on on paper, we are finalizing it and you will have to have a tentative plan ready now.
The next one D you can see that it is replaced G, D is the mapping.
That process also is very simple, very logical.
A question asked why Manoj gave Rajan a chocolate.
Depending on the condition that I use for choosing them, I can have less number of nodes or more number of nodes, depending on the function that I choose.
Explore two plies, B is the worst move.
But in real case real problem case we have plenty of rules.
Next one is ten.
One of them is hill climbing.
Hearing few words of music and recollecting the entire song is the other.
Then curved can have big curves and small curves, and round, can have long rounds and small rounds and so on and so forth. Okay .
And the algorithm is shown here.
So, that these are all examples of primitives, in fact Schank added plan later.
When you say greater than average the context determine what's the value on on on an average.
I have already discussed them.
Ideally, it should mimic expert’s consultation model.
Now such kind of, if else, is possible using something we'll see and we'll see examples of all of them C is conditional, C indicates that the relationship is conditional, if this happens that will happen, if else, kind of if, then kind of a relationship.
I've already told you theres the other one which is quite powerful is called simulated annealing, is an excellent example of how one can innovate from some other domain.
Look at the first figure, talking about alpha cutoff.
But number of missionaries calculate two plus zero is two.
One three two one zero is possible . Why you you can just pour out three out of the jug.
So, he's doing something with that stick.
Apply the first rule, if it is better go to that node, Okay .
For example, if we we take up a detailed script which we have not done and we have talked about very, very simple script but assume that there is a detailed cricket match viewing script and we're talking about that script.
So here the location is also possible to be represented not only time the location can also be represented.
What we are going to do in this particular module, one more thing that we are planning to do is is called goal stack planning.
The statement is basically talking about few events.
Now, the first neuron here connects to first second and third.
In our case we are represented in a semi CD form where where you are only using that ACT and nothing else here.
Almost every ant will follow that path.
What we're going to do is, we are going to look at a problem called Missionary Cannibal problem.
What does it mean?
X one into W one one one.
We we have seen that is a limitation of CD .
And, it stops when there is no path ahead.
The structure is not only dynamic, the structure is also completely distributed, every neuron takes a decision on its own.
For example, I I if I found a statement that I went to Jungle Book yesterday and we enjoyed our dinner.
Knowledge engineer will decide the database structure and the knowledge structure and probably XML structure and all that but he is also not go to code.
A plausible move generator is a programme what what does it do?
First, a bad move is allowed with some probability, okay . And that probability changes over a period of time.
So, this actually, the third move you can see that C is better than B and B is better than A.
Each one of them and then find out the best out of it.
So many things to store.
We pick up we describe an action called place on table which contains only one argument, place on table A will pick up the A cube and put it on the table a block A and put it on table.
So, that's why the conventional search algorithms won't work here because conventional search algorithm will always pick up the best heuristic value which is not going to work here.
For example, Let us, we have few examples okay .
That row value is basically a function which checks for a threshold value.
If you if you look mathematically, a random set of N weight is a point in an N dimensional space.
Zero is the depth, we begin with zero and the current player who am malam player or the other one.
I’ve already told you that it is possible to have multiple final states and here we can.
So, either B or F is zero.
If you know how to write heuristic function whatever we’re going to talk about is perfectly alright.
I just got these four values, their path; path is not very important, but then value is very important, because based on this value I'll decide which path to choose , which move to choose. okay .
The question that one may ask is this branch and bound is great.
In fact, it is possible for a neural network to solve any problem it can learn.
But in case of this thing , expert system, you probably have more than one beta releases and so on so forth.
Now currently the knowledge is almost always coded in some form of classes because classes offer lot of advantages like inheritance and so on.
Back propagation algorithm is something which is used to train neural networks.
Ravan is dead means his health is reduced to minus ten, what was it earlier, maybe greater than minus ten.
You can say Sachin gave his bat to Sarfaraz. So Sachin ATRANS okay you can look at that representation.
That mean again assume that your input, the state space is is presented in a way that is a collection of some components.
Similarly, ‘fly’ also involves something else happening. ‘Fly’ means you you you took a plane to reach to that place, so that is the additional information.
Okay for example, here he has to wait for fifteen minutes and that angers him.
So, this also is a valid state.
It’s pretty dynamic .
So, when you when you learn something to the contrary of what whatever is mentioned in the script, they no no longer be there in the script which is activated, Okay .
There is no ontology.
What you're supposed to do is to provide some images of G with and some images without that horizontal line.
Second one is very easy to understand.
That method is pretty good if you're able to use your heuristics better, okay .
Do you need an additional expert for it?
The reason is that if you do it that way, remember with every move you will have to explore the search tree and how to apply static evaluation function to all leaf nodes.
We’ll explore the right child of the parent , that is 1,5,2, again a left, 1,4,3 1,4,3 then we have 4,4,0.
Now this is not love, you can understand that you're not representing love but that's not the problem of CD ,
In this particular module we extend our discussion about planning that we had earlier in the previous module.
The other example is Ravan is dead.
So that is that can predict, Okay .
Now lot of I do not want to again describe the difference between soft computing and AI
What does that mean?
This basically is derived from a area which is quite unrelated to artificial intelligence, called metallurgy.
Similarly, if you want to get zero you will have to get negative infinity which is also impossible, so it it continues to learn even if it has learnt that thing correctly.
Great! See, now try to understand it is L M one C one, R M two C two and BL.
You may traverse a very long path and get a solution, it’s pro probably if you’d have traversed on the other side probably you’ll get it much earlier, but that’s it.
So, you can see that the representation in the handout that Dhoni and PROPEL they they are connected like before - actor and action, but here we are talking about an object which is being acted upon, okay .
An interesting thing here is like the first case is inserted, you test the system, second case is inserted, you test the system for both cases, third case is inserted, you test the cases test the system for third case and all that.
In case number one, we say that it is the summation is beyond greater than the threshold value, there is a problem okay the sorry greater than the threshold value it it’s a friend, but we provide something else and it still the summation is beyond that.
Now how have I decided those fifty images?
I’ve already talked about this, the the string X which are interested in checking and all this thing . If it does not hold the process will not stop.
When the rule is complex, we have seen that we need to write less number of rules which are general.
So, in either case, this particular sequence is not useful.
There are some charts which can tell you whether an activity is to follow some other activity or an activity can happen in parallel with some activity and so on so forth, depending on their prerequisites, their requirement and all that.
Okay .
In case of twenty six cities, twenty five factorial by two total number of alternatives are possible that comes out to be something I can't even read,
Regression is relevant - again it is moving in the right direction.
How we do it?
We look at the Tic Tac Toe position and decide whether it is win loss or draw okay .
It works like a geologist who looks at the sample of earth and do something with it, they tries to figure out what it contains, Okay , the kind of material and all that .
So, we have applied rule number two.
An excellent example is, let us look at this particular tour A, B, C, D, E, F, G and again A.
So, what he did, he wrote a neural network based program.
Mahesh.
After a while they realize, oh, we are doing this.
You cannot apply any rule anytime.
So, let's talk about.
But that’s the reason why I have chosen a different set of string.
Which move and why?
So, for placing suppose if my queen is under attack somewhere and I have two possible moves, I can save my queen one, I can place this pawn one step further at this position.
But if you have two thousand cities or five thousand cities or e..e.. even one hundred cities, it is going to be impossible because the number of permutations and combinations are too much for you to actually do it.
How many output units do I need?
Recombination, now those five are to be matted together; recombine together to produce next generation that is called recombination.
So, this again is an invalid state, okay .
And it had around eight thousand components in the static evaluation function of that Deep Thought computer which could beat Gary Kasparov, had eight thousand components.
Those bits are what, zero and one.
So there is no question of invoking that script.
You can't backtrack and then redo it.
Milkha Singh PTRANS himself to some other location or I PTRANS myself to some other location.
After ten iterations.
Now this is good for pedagogy purpose but in true sense this will be a complete CD representation.
So that is what we are going to look at.
This is the the representation.
You've seen in the last module that whenever we we encounter some statements, they they do not only refer to that single case but they represent complete scenario,for example, when I say that I went to watch a match, I not only talk about viewing a match but I talk about many other things like I whenever I, for example, that that happens in normal communication as well.
It is about picking up a random state and checking if it is a solution.
And when you consider the threshold, you also have X zero W zero, where X zero is basically one.
You can take the grain on the other side.
So if it is winning for us, losing for us or a draw, we have already seen these those three cases.
Okay , the rest is simple.
You can see that some part from parent one, some part from parent two.
In fact it is done, I I talked about friend, now I can talk about something similar called recognizing faces of employees of a company.
We begin with state called eight zero zero, the initial state.
The rule number thirteen.
Then example, you say that Jay watched the match and come back home by bus.
Because the interface basically is to be used by the user and not the expert or knowledge engineer.
So, we can’t do it and in in that case this heuristic is going to be quite useful.
But there is one more example.
So, it says that the bullet travels from gun, went into the hostage.
You have been to a place long back and you visiting again.
And level, if you look from the levels of tree, it is two but number of nodes it’s three. clear nose Okay .
Deletion is on AB will be deleted and now on AB will no longer be true.
We are not going to discuss that further.
But the other requirement.
What the point here is that you can decide that slope on of an activation function for if you want to learn faster and all that.
You can say yes, yes great
So, that is called positive misclassification, okay .
And sometimes you need to have more number of epochs, depending on the complexities of the images that you provide.
So, it’s reiterates re-strengthens the pheromone volume.
We have already seen examples of a general and specific roles.
We apply first rule, we get minus five.
That means X Z value can be maximum three , the initial state is eight zero zero, Okay .
We begin from L three three, R zero zero and BL.
But here it is not possible in square.
okay , there are a lot of things.
We are going in utmost detail means every component of the problem is clearly defined and told that this is to be solved.
But how do you search using branch and bound?
And calculate the value P which is probability one plus E raised to minus delta E upon T.
And again, if the script writer is good enough, it it could get this information that why one can get bored?
Now if you, if you look at this, which value out of that will be be passed up?
okay So, planning also is part of formalization and also like if you have taken some OR course, you probably know what I'm talking about.
So, we have to calculate the difference.
And when I have a boat on the left hand side I can only apply rule number one.
So that's zero. So X zero Y plus Z .
Only modifies the act.
That's the previous level.
We'll We'll apply We'll have to provide this current state because unless we provide current state you will not be in a position to apply PMG to it and generate children.
It’s not an object, okay .
Now if you using pure Hill Climbing, you can't move forward.
We’ll begin with three types of situation which is the outcome of Tic Tac Toe.
So it's quite obvious.
N is not possible to determine we’ll have to go further NL.
Irrespective of the sign.
Okay for example, I'm I'm Im using a depth first search.
I’m actually incrementing the heuristic value.
I try one more .
You will design the database first or knowledge base or you're going to write the rules or you’re going to collect those rules and if there are more than one experts, how you're going to sync those rules and so on so forth.
Now you cough please understand.
And then we want all missionaries on the other side and then moving cannibals on the other side.
You can see that such characteristics are very, very important for survival.
The other one are the links, those links are are known as dependencies and very rightly so, because it talks about how one object is dependent on the other one.
So, the the terrorists become the actor and the hostage become the recipient, okay .
These methods are are , either preserving order or position or both in a way that they allow better qualities of the parent to persist over the generation.
This is the same problem like you you have in other disciplines and for which you require standardization and all that.
So, A is to be placed on table, then you achieve free B.
clears nose First time, we have already seen generating a state space.
In this case we’ll have only eighty one, nine nine into nine is eighty one inputs.
For every children, the second step though is non leaf, will consider it to be leaf and proceed further.
So, that is not part of the start state, first condition is not satisfied.
You can see that first scene is going to a stadium the second scene is buying a ticket, the third one is going inside stadium and sitting on a seat, taking your seat then watching a match and then exiting.
We begin from initial state and reach to the final state.
So you can choose the book that suits your domain, look for heuristic function or try writing for yourself but otherwise it's it’s simple.
Based on these two it comes back with static evaluation function value.
And if it’s not there I’ll look at my table drawer and if it’s not there I’ll search for my daughter, Okay .
This also is not very good, Okay .
And one great thing about MOP is that because it stores everything together, it can relate two different things and and one example of a program called Swale is very interesting.
Next three , we are moving missionaries.
When the errors are propagated back, the weights are adjusted accordingly which we discussed in a previous module.
So, props also change, default set of props, obviously are there but additional you may have them additional ones.
The same process actually is used in simulated annealing.
But then you can’t move further.
So, these are the A's which are provided to the system and you can see that in this case some of the it’s pretty crude representation but it's still possible for us to understand how it works.
For example, one is called recipient case relationship, when the ownership is transferred.
The goal stack planning or GSP as I've told you earlier, is using this, component by component, pick up each component, putting on the stack and solve it.
Why it’s called local?
Toh , With that note, would like to conclude this module.
So, such things, such moves such states are better compared to others.
Because, we’re not reached to the final goal state.
Ten is the maximum and minus ten is the minimum value, so when you say health equal to minus ten, the person is dead.
They pick up something else and test and so and so forth, and that's called generate and test.
The sense that our neurons are constantly dying since birth.
Maximum values of missionary and cannibal can be two.
Thank you!
So, this value describes weight of which layer, okay .
There is nothing in between.
So, we would like to increase cohesion in the segment and reduce coupling between segments.
If it is not phi that means you’ve deleted something which is part of the goal state.
We have seen three representations but believe me there are hundred odd representations one can easily write, even more, potentially infinite in fact.
And if you look from that angle, it is one two four and eight .
That is the meaning.
So, what we are doing we we say that this previous state I use this action okay to get this previous state.
The same thing happens here as well.
So, that's a very, very critical part of this.
That R which is again a three-prong structure which is R indicates is a recipient case relationship.
deep breath And now what we want to have is only four gallons of milk in that particular jug.
There there are other cough there are other objects- menu and rate card or menu and tablecloth, plates and glasses and so on so forth.
There is something called state and I've talked about that state a little earlier, when you said that health equal to minus ten, you're talking about state of a variable, state of something which is between minus ten to ten.
So, unlike hill climbing it does not get stuck.
But when you say that Sarfaraz took the bat from Sachin, you can see that the statement representation does not remain the same ap the rest of that is absolutely the same but you can see that the actor changes from Sachin to Sarfaraz.
If this node is better than this I’ll just go, that’s called hill climbing.
Actions are the vehicle which enables us to do this.
That's what I was talking about when I say when I said that the CD captures the meaning and represents the meaning rather than the words themselves.
I have two strings.
So, number of hidden units you need are twenty two.
The the ants which carry that food are coming back on the same trail.
There is something which stores the current state, there has to be something which stores the current state.
We cannot have more, why?
So, this is an example where you can use back propagation neural network.
That many huge number of nodes.
The difference is that the instrument is is helps this thing to occur, okay .
Okay , but then there is a catch, catch is you have ordered them in this way fashion on A table and on BA.
The actors can be of two different types.
The object is stick.
For example, if an an ant is travelling and it has two different paths and one with higher pheromone value, other with less pheromone value it’ll understand that more ants have travelled along this path and this path is more recent, will probably pick up that path, okay .
The problem of hill climbing is that you end up in a local maxima.
We do not have heuristic function here.
Is one more thing.
With that we’ll come to an end of this module.
For goal director reasoning it is the opposite.
So if it is the case, BFS and DFS will not stop.
how can we provide that?
The advantage is that we'll be able to generalize any size any any orientation anywhere, if you got two different slanting lines in different direction and a horizontal line it is A.
You will be surprised where is that farmer present, not present and all that has gone.
For example, if you want to recognize a signature, the problem itself is quite fuzzy, not only the problem is fuzzy though we are able to effectively solve that problem, we will be able to recognize a signature, we’ll not be able to tell exactly how we have done it.
So that is called nearest neighbour.
So there are two options W and L.
Height is example of a state okay .
One, we have minus three and minus four.
Now which move to choose given some alternatives is pretty hard problem.
It should follow exactly how a doctor should the patient should consult a conventional doctor, okay , the same way if he can or little better acceptable.
With that we’ll come to an end of this particular module .
The sigmoid function you can see is, is S shaped.
With that we come to an end of this module.
We'll have to do something.
What about chicken and grain?
So, we’ll have only two different types of images.
what you do is you just let them roam around in the real space,
Okay .
Now everything is assumed you can see that in single statement, I'm talking about multiple things together the complete scenario now when you talk about scripts, scripts are these scenarios, Okay
Now this is a a mixture of CD representation as well as the the normal language.
Bstar is little different.
Obviously, plausible move generator and static evaluation functions are assumed to exist.
So, we we have a question mark there and this is again, remember, the question mark is an important this thing here, okay .
Tears.
What does that mean?
You can't you should not be going beyond that limit and we'll be discussing about that soon.
It changes the properties of the genes on the permanent basis.
So this this process allows those characteristics ability to climb, ability to swim and all that in in the offspring.
There are few strategies which are quite simple as I said, but quite useful as well.
The case number one, placing CD on the table the action was not relevant.
You'll have to manage uncertainty.
Okay So that is fine.
Testing and evaluation comes next.
Well, let us take the third rule.
How it is done?
So, the question is, should we define rules which cannot use for solving a problem?
Similarly, E F G H not equal to six, twelve and four.
Why that static evaluation function is needed and all that also we’ll be looking at in this particular module.
So, point is just this.
How it is done?
C is free but D is not free.
okay even if some pieces are there in between knight, you know those does not create obstacle for a knight.
Patient, doctor, whatever. Relation between those classes, which classes are a superclass, which class is a subclass and which class is used by others and so on, so forth.
So, and then they narrow it down and then try all possible cases generate and test there.
I can sacrifice queen for this pawn because this pawn is more important for for me right now.
Now it's not always a great thing to do but then most cases you don't have other option Okay .
But you can see that even in that case there are only two alternatives: one alternative is simple where you achieve one, the other one is achieved.
Once, that is done we’ll able to recognize my signature much more correctly, okay so that’s how it is done.
So capacity of Y is five so you can have five or less and Z less than or equal to three .
The other thing is also there, I've I’ve used my own order.
There are two children, neither of them has better value and they're stuck.
What it does is pretty complex.
Here an example is Abdul decided to earn more money.
The experts are involved in this process.
I already discussed that.
The back-propagation algorithm is one of the most commonly used algorithm and that's why we are going to stress about how that functions and how one can use that algorithm for solving problems which otherwise not possible to be used, not possible to be solved by other means.
So, that is this function.
He received the news of sad demise of his grandfather and returned back now.
How that is done is the essence of this ant colony optimization.
So, you can see that it is it is possible for somebody to conclude something like that, because it is provided here.
It returns NodeInfo.
Brian solves many problems without algorithm.
Please understand, and this is not only in the case of missionary cannibal.
Welcome friends in the eighth module of AI , genetic algorithms and travelling salesman problem.
okay Nothing else is different, you can see that.
Okay to the same statement that we've seen in in in case of rule one is represented here as as an additional.
Regression is coming back from the goal state.
The meaning is that Nobita is doing something with the stick, which enables which which is an instrument for Nobita to eat rice.
So or for example a match, viewing a match, a track is a cricket match so you're talking about basically cricket match viewing Okay ?
You have seen that AI is possible to be solved the problems of AI are possible to be solved using a method called State Space, where we can define the these problem states in in a State Space.
Now that is called simple single point crossover.
Where M one greater than or equal to C one.
The best applying that thing will get us best static evolution function value and that will pass up by and that's quite interesting.
You probably have seen that thing yourself and we’re going to write, we’re going to discuss about the algorithm which does the same thing.
And we we let us take the case of seven cities and we pick up a city as a root node and you just start travelling like you do.
Okay , and it’s also subjective.
what are the components for solving this problem?
Minus three and two now they’re explored.
Check it! Number of missionaries three, number of cannibals three.
Now what you do is, now you have those offspring, the older one are are thrown away,
So, it it begins with planning out all differences then insert all the components on the goal stack.
So, in the beginning we'll we’ll we'll look at the 0,5,3 then 3,5,0 is right child and then 8,0,0 is right child. Okay . That is precisely what we’re doing.
You can see that.
If you are not very good in mathematics probably it looks little hard to understand but this is not so, please try to understand.
Genetic algorithm is little different from conventional AI techniques that is recently added; in fact it is some other researchers do not call it part of AI .
So, what you need to do is to travel in N dimensional space from the randoms point that you start with to the goal state.
I don't feel like that.
If that parent cannot produce the next child then parent to parent is taken up.
So, it is quite possible.
Okay , the other method which we are going to see is called Beam search.
And that was very time consuming.
okay .
But anyway chess is better program to be managed compared to many other programs.
C is what?
It's it’s not that easy.
Okay , So, what we do now?
Sometimes, even direction is to be mentioned.
In fact, branch and bound is possible to be used with other algorithms as well.
Our search is an associative way is one more.
F is also copied, Okay .
So, that it’s very important that you also involve user into this process.
But those are all things which are part of the representation.
So, this is very, very important.
What does that mean?
It should generate the children.
What we do not want is fox and chicken.
There are some components which are there in state space, the initial state space there, are some components in the final state space.
The seven-step solution.
So, that is the second thing and nothing else is possible if you opt for a draw okay .
So what you do?
There is no standard as such.
So, when you say Mahesh hurt Jayesh is is one conceptualization which is happening, and its use is okay okay as an object okay .
So, place on top BA requires you to move from the previous state to the current state, actually you're doing the other way round you okay but it it is to be described this way.
Because that domain is more unstructured and probably this thing , the system itself is less structured as well.
We’ll again stress this thing once we talk about how anything is represented in CD .
So we use that word here, as well.
okay?
We explore the leftmost 3,5,0 and left with 0,5,3.
And there are similar cases.
Look at the slide, three missionaries and three cannibals to cross the river with only one boat.
In the beginning, usually you have a sparse neighbourhood and then you go in depth you have a a dense neighbourhood.
And it says that I'm adding something which is part of the goal state, which is not phi.
Annealing schedule is basically how you're going to cool the alloy down.
Check if the precondition pre previous state is relevant.
Now, an important something little different which little different than the conventional State-space search that we’ve seen so far.
Okay the beginning you you you just insert all nodes in an array and other unexplored node in the other array and find out the best node from the array.
Now how come we have this state?
okay I I could also have specified current I I only . okay current state only , but providing player will give me a better idea about how good or bad that function is.
What are the processes involved, what exactly a doctor going to do, what exactly a patient going to do, who is going to do with the expert system, who is going to provide what to expert system, who expects what from expert system and so on so forth is done in the prototype construction phase.
If I apply to two, thirty-five into thirty-five states.
So, the Guided Search Methods are not something which is different than unguided, they're they are Unguided Search Methods with the use of heuristics.
For example, we have assumed that eight,zero,zero is the beginning this thing a move, Okay .
It is not about a searching through state space, no.
And many a times it happens that both of them take various case studies and see how expert solves that case.
Again this is a very very important issue when you write any recursive algorithm.
So, this is a relevant state relevant progression.
Ideally the sample should contain everything that could be there, for example, if my signature is to be recognized and I I will have to actually try writing my signature twenty, thirty, forty, fifty times and hopefully it should cover all all different variations I I produce while I sign okay .
Okay so that that is something which is which is very common and seeing across all life forms.
So, heuristic function should have two important characteristics, should closely match the the the real value and should be as fast as it it can be.
It's called Memory Organized Pockets.
How can one write the moves, the the eleven twelve moves, how can you start from the initial state, apply moves and restore solution
Not only leave-alone expert system, every system requires that.
ok The initial state in case of chess, all of us know what that initial state is, that is passed to.
This function is known as as activation function.
Now this is a small story that is presented to the problem solver using this thing script.
It’s as simple as the previous one.
Why?
Once they do it, once they are able to mimic the human brain, they are able to do many other things.
Toh it cannot come down directly.
A statement, for example, Ram loves Sita or Ram found Sita loving or or or something like that.
Unlike that frames are quite similar.
How how important is the the central control and how important it is to have occupy a specific position in chess and so on so forth.
And then you send farmer farmer and chicken on the other side.
So none of them is a solution but we cannot go.
I when I suggest a patient to to get X-ray, how many times I’m I'm right in in saying so because at that point of time the fracture evident.
One outcome is that I provide image of the friend and it recognizes it correctly.
For example, if you have one cannibal, you can send one missionary with it.
They travel along that and again, they start travelling in a random fashion but usually along the obstacle.
Why we need that?
One, I may provide the image of my friend but the output says he is not.
But anyway, well , I'll talk about that example soon.
And it can actually help cause effect determining cause effect relationship as well.
And in fact, a single statement might require multiple conceptualization.
There is somebody who is going to code this thing in Java or C++ or Python or something.
It is able to solve lot of problems for example recently Google provided a solution, you you you just look at the image and can ask for something which is otherwise is just impossible.
It is x zero w zero plus x one w one and so on and it is greater than zero, then it fires, less than zero, it does not.
Every rule has some prerequisite.
If it is not phi, good; the state is relevant.
We’ll see an example.
So, you can see that EXPEL is is the verb which is being used here, okay .
The method is is applied in a way that the the all all alternate alternative state is possible, all all all children of a node they are tested and and checked if one is better than the other.
Many times, the things look pretty complex on the face of it.
You can see that I saw the match, I watched the match and so on so forth, all similar statements will have similar representation, but the saw match represent the same thing I watched a match and I MTRANS match where the the recipient case relationship from my eyes to my conceptual processor CP.
And please understand that there are seventeen odd rules that we are going to look at.
And in this particular simple script I've talked about scene scenes which are normal, expected or default sequences of events which is which are likely to happen when the script is invoked.
Now if there is a cycle in the solution path you may not reach to a solution because cycle may go on forever.
But for some other problems that is a better method we’ll see that thing in in in our eighth module when we look at genetic algorithms.
It allows a bad move with some probability.
So you’ll have to try an alternate, Okay .
So this is what I get A, B, C, D, G, F, I, H, E so this is what I get.
There is the other algorithm which also is quite useful.
Mad is minus ten, ecstatic is plus ten, so on and all other things are in between.
Remember branch and bound prefers the nearer, this thing , the nodes.
Once this is done, I'm entering into the next phase.
In this case eighty-one input units because it is a nine into nine matrix.
Okay , so that is the next statement you can see which is is a three-prong structure which represents the state change, Ravan’s health is now minus ten.
Remember it it applies back propagation algorithm for learning where the errors are propagated back.
Simulated annealing is is a method where you allow the worst move from the the current move unlike hill climbing with a typical amount of probability that is derived from physical process of annealing and uses almost similar method for choosing how much with how much how how many how much probability you allow the the incorrect move sorry not incorrect it is less this thing a worse move from a current current move and so on.
Now that's the representation .
So you can easily understand.
So, that means great.
When that particular node that you’re planning to choose is explored a little further it is called secondary search.
Pretty simple?
As I said, eight thousand components were there in that thing , and it was very, very powerful.
So in there you don't have a children.
Okay , when we do that what happens?
let them win or survive themselves and those who survive after some time, collect them and made them.
So, free B on A table okay this is additional.
So, what you do is as an HR manager, you would like to have to strategies designed and defined to make sure that they have more tendency to retain in the organization.
That also is mentioned in this particular rule okay .
And there are a few prerequisites.
In fact, if you have played Tic Tac Toe yourself, the best move is to occupy the center in the beginning, why because you have degree of freedom.
It indicates the relation between two picture producers or two objects.
They are able to do it.
We’ve seen the earlier cases, the repeated nodes and and the nodes which are already explored.
Then you add total collective pheromone added by the ants in the current cycle so, that is delta tau T plus one.
Now the answer is that what we do is we’ll reduce the weights of every case where xi is non-zero.
But despite all this, the basic things that I'm going to talk about is the same.
If you have lost your path, you will prefer to walk on a trail, Okay .
Thank you!
Remember, we are discussed about the dictionary approach somewhere back and machine learning that we are going to look at next contains something similar.
So, an important job here is to see whether we have invoked a script.
And the third one.
We do not want any cycles in the solution path.
Okay , the rule number eight talks about the place where the conceptualization occurs.
If the keys are there, I’ve got the solution, I quit.
Okay , and then there are some scenes. The scenes are you can see that quite interestingly P PTRANS P to the stadium.
It looks at all possible moves, next to next moves and next to next moves and so on as long as the time permits and out once it it is done it'll return back which move is better for me.
So, from that newspaper it is going into my mind and when you talk about Schank, who developed this and his team, the the team members who developed this, use three different parts of brain, one is long term memory which retains everything that is remembered, short term memory and and a conscious processor that something which processes the information.
Second, which are yet to be explored and the third which which we are considering right now, Okay .
It’s calling PMG and PMG generates children for that particular node.
You may you may ask why the function is called objective rather than heuristic?
We are into twentieth module of AI and we'll be discussing about some prerequisites for the MiniMax algorithm to be applied and a few other algorithms also, the prerequisites are just fine.
If you if you go back and look at your our exploration of eight five three gallon water jug problem or if you explore this three four gallon water jug problem and so on so forth, you will find that in most cases the rare number of nodes are are more likely to yield to solution, yield solution.
The explanation is is very critical here.
Because only administrator will be able to give rights to these developers and testers and all that.
If the ant has travelled some other path without having a food source, will not going to come back the pheromone value will evaporate.
fine.
We are changing states component by component, we changed one component, second, third.
Here also we use small agents which are used collectively to solve complex problems.
But mutation is very important.
Sometimes, somebody do have but usually our brains are capable of making sure, even if the neurons die, they do not lose data.
Eight five three gallon water milk jug problem is little different.
‘Ran yesterday’ and ‘ran fast’, what's the difference?
And and again, I will say that only two consecutive states.
They travel along their own generated path but then there are two outgoing lines for the third ant.
We are now into thirtieth module of AI .
The system wants to learn whether it has to cook for Jay or not and there is no mention.
We’ll begin with something called Variable neighbourhood descent.
Number of hidden units is taken as a geometric mean of input and output.
Every node represents some state some typical word uttered by speaker and you're trying to like translate that statement.
You better look at the handout which which clearly and there's one more thing here I’ve not represented hurt as a a a CD representation.
It can be even more complicated.
So, progression and regression are quite important thing for planning and there is one more thing which is called relevant.
So that is T value is decided by designers intuitions and judgement and it is done empirically.
We’re stuck, we cannot move forward and we’re not at the solution.
We like to explore a search space much faster and real time. So well well use sparse neighbourhood.
And there is one situation which we are going to talk about.
Same way, the output unit all inputs all hidden units connected to it, they are they are all multiplied, HY WY, HI WIJ, In fact IJ if this is the Jth unit, HI JI, H one J J , assume this is J clears nose .
So, we will not be exploring that here.
The parent one, first element, first city is A and the mapping says A should be replaced by E.
Okay , so that's the point here.
And whatever is remaining is is here.
In the case number two, when you try to achieve one the it takes more time because it is not that straightforward.
Rajan told Manoj if he did not give him chocolate, he will not let him pray play with his friends.
Okay . You may have your own, completely your own set of primitives, you can still solve the problem, but this is an excellent solution.
So, you don't need to look for symptoms of malaria or typhoid and all that.
So, if I do that, I I have to step away from only labelling, I'll have to give some value and that value when we we give that value we call it static evaluation function which is quite similar to heuristic function.
The farmer is represented by one, the fox is represented by two, the chicken is represented by four and grain is represented by eight.
And if you have that context ready, the ontology is ready, how the objects are related?They’re ready.
When we try to make sure that when farmer is not around this two combination is also difficult to express in fact.
Now we’ll have to plan one after the other.
You may try one more function.
If this match is a football match, you probably have other roles like the linemen and the referees and and so on and so forth.
You need a powerful server and with this this kind of knowledge extraction process, which can tell you exactly what this packet is doing.
what is happening in remember, remembering basically converts something or or transfers something which is there in CP , into long term memory or short term memory.
So, that is missing here.
where we had only few nodes to explore and we could get the answer.
And where there's some guided search already applied in the problem domain it becomes so small that you can you cannot worry about you don’t need to worry about heuristic, you just try exploring all possible option and solve them.
Now let us look at the summary of what we have looked at this module, in the heuristic search module.
Now that's the other word which is being used.
In the next module, we are going to look at a script, something which addresses the lacuna that we have seen here.
And there is there are other methods which uses Depth-first search.
Now we are going to talk about GAs in an algorithm, genetic algorithm.
We look at their characteristics and somehow relate people with similar characteristics together and then group them together, that grouping or clustering of of inputs also is very important, and that also is type of learning, that’s called unsupervised learning, okay .
Now, let us take one more action called place on top.
for an example I've already given later part of the game when it's pretty crucial.
And the function obviously is called heuristic function rather than objective function.
Now, two important characteristics of best first search.
When you say ‘ran fast’, it it the fast does not add to the entire conceptualization.
And Offspring the child, the children’s genome basically is a combination of parents.
The same way, every middle unit is connected to every output unit and if it has more than one layer, the same thing is applied.
So that is false.
All these things are there and then you also have exit conditions or results, Okay .
Because we are not sure what what is unravelling later.
Then you should be able to explain me.
The conceptualization is over and now I'm going to formalize my system.
So, that final meaning is lost, okay .
And this connections are dynamic, they change over a period of time and this connections are weighted , they they contain weights and this weights basically carries the knowledge that we have in our brain.
There is no search .
So that is related, that the relation is indicated by an arrow and an O object, okay .
okay And B L or B R, B L means boat on the left side and boat on the right side.
Now whether rules are properly executed, whether you need to reschedule the order of the rule, whether you need to fine tune those rules, that also is to be properly properly done.
No, sometimes it is not.
So, you can use them.
okay So, that's exactly happening next.
So, this is one example.
Similarly, the middle part of parent one is copied into child two.
And it is quite possible that one expert gives a different list, the other expert gives a different list.
Population is a word which is known used what we have.
So the bike is an object for this PROPEL action, okay .
Now again, a critical difference is that unlike the earlier case, it is not yes- no thing.
Everybody can row the boat.
They won’t start from initial state and reach to final state.
Neural network is come out of AI , is no longer part of AI actually, but still people talk about Neural Network when they talk about AI , Neural network has become a discipline on its own.
That conceptualization is Mahesh propelling a stone to Jayesh and you can see that there is a direction indicator as well it’s going from somewhere to Jayesh the object is stone.
But then why we use word static evaluation function?
Let me repeat that both the components as well as the associated weight is experts’ decision.
Obviously they’re needed.
We are going to address a simpler problem of how one can represent using a state space.
Okay , so you just see if if pawn at this place and the next next block is empty, then you just move that pawn there.
So, that is very critical here.
The ant is very simple agent with very few functions and wilt has which has very limited intelligence.
The first one is a discrete function, you can see that the second one is not discrete, it is continuous.
And there are many problems with CD .
If it is satisfied, it is fine but if any component is not satisfied it’s again inserted on the stack.
So, something which is removed should not be there in the goal state or if it is there in the goal state, we have done something wrong because we wanted and we have removed it
We'll look at one more problem called eight five three gallon milk jug problem.
Now you choose six but then there are no rules possible in this case.
Okay , so state space in that case is pretty complex.
See what we have done.
please understand, that's the problem of language.
So, this is an important thing okay and a very simple description of an action - place on top XY, three things, every action is described in this three different using these three different attributes in in PDDL .
So, what I do is I provide images of five different friends of mine and I want the neural this neuron to learn to classify them.
So can we go to some other node?
So, you can get this thing done.
Now, why have I used double arrows, because it is something I found that thing somewhere in Schank’s paper.
Is is only the the the magnitude the sign which actually makes the difference but otherwise technically there's no difference.
Based on this, the inputs are provided to the back propagation algorithm.
Fortunately, for us the empirical studies the the practical solutions to this problem proved that it is actually possible for almost all cases.
Why when you do when you go for dense neighbourhood okay why We have already seen why sparse neighbourhood.
That is precisely what we are trying to do now.
Similarly, you can see the other example of mental state.
Current state is on A table on BA on CD on D.
Let me tell you that this neural networks began when there was no hidden unit.
The value is and remember static evolution function only applies at this place.
CD was devised long back, but still is not used to the extent it should.
We have also seen that it is possible to write multiple ways Okay .
But if I get a response from a medical system that you’ve got a blood cancer, I would ask, why, why you are telling me so?
You can see that the first line say x one, w one k, x two w two k.
We have seen that it is complex to write rules.
So, we get as near accurate as a heuristic value as possible.
I’m I won’t name Boman but I just say that there was a parsi actor, and you would immediately come back and tell me it was Dilwale, how did you do that, no sorry, it is Happy New year.
It depends on the complete conceptualization ‘the friend’ depends on complete conceptualization and not either MTRANS or I.
Now, the N value depends on the features that you take from the input.
So, the artificial neuron you can see that it is pretty simple design.
And in fact it should you should explore everything in in a systematic way.
First thing is initial value of temperature, when to reduce it and how much to reduce Okay , for example, initial value is twenty.
C has three B has two and E has again two, and now if you look at those values, B has two children, F is five and G is three, minus three.
So, five ply is deeper, six ply is deep, so that depth of that ply is indicated by current depth.
So those who use word objective function use word operator rather than rules.
It also aid adds a lot of additional information.
So you can have eight or less .
Okay , one more type of search is called Tabu search.
What is the value?
One is advantage that I've talked about multiple times is that multiple statements.
So, we have multiple statements with same meaning or similar meaning or same shade of meaning are are are derived into single similar representation.
Hello Friends! We have already seen few things about AI and search methods.
So this is the the partially mapped crossover method. Okay .
Scientists have not yet found a way to sync those processors in in a seamless way.
Now, and this these two conceptualizations have some relationship.
Friends, let us begin with the the second module.
Now, every other person now is roped in the team gets bigger and everybody is told about the system, everybody gets the idea about the system and will be very clear about their own role in the system, okay .
And today as I said, there is something called Deep Learning which is happening where you have lot of layers and there is a modified algorithm.
Then you will have to decide once that that basic questions are answered.
So, C is the first, so we copy C here, Okay .
I have few moves possible.
How it is done?
I I will not give you a silver bullet to solve this problem and nobody in the world can do it.
Our brain somehow in brain also works that way.
You assume that I I purchased a ticket, I I I went into the stadium I am seated on my seat, I view the match and and and looked at the toss then in first inning and the second innings hopefully I'm talking about ODI .
Based on that we pass the value up.
M two number of missionaries and C two number of cannibals on the right hand side of the river and the boat is on the left side.
Not in all cases those simple addition and subtractions are possible.
Even if you don’t know it’s still Okay .
So, this process , the algorithm which does all this, it the algorithm tells how you calculate the hind layer, that’s called activation, how what it what flows from the middle layer to the final layer and so on, so forth.
So, Ram ‘Do’.
So, that’s something quite similar to GA is happening.
It is completely distributed and all all neurons work in parallel.
What should I do? I just look at my pocket, if it’s there and where I am hanging my keys.
In fact testing, that’s what testing is.
So, it is it is something which says that one single hidden layer is is is suffice, is good enough for solving any problem.
Now, this is simplified version of the very function.
When we get value ten.
Now, what did Ram do?
We also have a final state.
Next one.
I'll pick up that move.
Whether the other experts are invited for additional components that you would like to add or not.
You check for abnormal cases as well, which is not possible in conventional cases.
Now, you may be surprised what that one is.
However silly it looks like that's our that's the way we do it.
So, very, very important thing is to have no redundancy in the knowledge.
Okay , and usually when you write a game playing program, play around with game playing program very often that function is known as move Move generator.
Welcome friends, to thirty fifth module of AI .
And thats that makes the the other elements available to us.
So, what we do is we first of all achieve X then Y and then Z and the problem is solved.
okay .
In the previous module, we have seen simple eight, five, three gallon water jug problem
okay .
So, if you choose say value P is point three so the probability of number generated less than point three is obviously point three.
So, when this happens, it is quite possible there are three possible outcomes.
I do not want to discuss more about why it is part of AI and why it is not.
So, that's the reason why documentation is very critical.
All four moves that I have all four moves says that it is N.
What does that mean?
There is no algorithm that you can talk about.
Physically, the square function look the same ,as shown on the slide.
There are many other methods.
And there is one more thing.
Both of them are misclassification.
Now we are substracting M.
They try to access the server, the server is not responding.
Now, applying this, two calculations place on table A dot addition intersection goal state, you can see that goal state on A table.
What is a branching factor?
For example, think of a robot domain.
I've told you that on A table is part of the goal state and that is what it is.
So, the first condition is satisfied.
For example, a cricket player usually are is taller than normal people.
In depth bound, you can assume some length, but this iterative deepening, it is it is only going to have one and not more.
When these three lines remain active, these three hidden units become active, the unit which wants to learn to become active and A is presented, will learn to become active.
So you just provide your and basically the heuristic is based on a simple method.
For example A, B, C, D, E, F, G is one tour and A, C, B, D, E, F, G is another tour.
How will you decide the hidden layer?
That's precisely what we're trying to stress here.
So, it can see that you you can see that X results into Y that results into Z and this relationship is going to help us getting the answer.
Okay Into one there is a structure called NodeInfo which the algorithm returns.
5,0,3 is already explored.
That person will not back it up okay ?
Why it’s called hill climbing?
So, if A plus E is one that means either A is one or E is one.
Now C and F, you can see that they are not part of the mapping and that is why they will have to be copied as it is.
But that will be tested in this case.
So I'll choose W and not L.
Then we have two options.
Okay so those paths are already found so that pheromone value will of a segment, okay , is equal to total number of ants travelled multiplied by the pheromone value that they have sprayed on that .
And you can see that they are also named as max.
We have X Y Z in in in the jug.
And remember this is a past tense.
Now, this is something very similar to which we have seen in the in the beginning, when we discussed about static evaluation function.
Also in the case of endgame you do that.
So, later on if somebody talks about bullets or guns or something, you can relate that to this thing, okay .
That makes it fourteen , that also is not allowed.
Now that part is to be represented.
Then again it goes up at that component.
Thank you.
So, it is possible that the different hidden units learn to remain active when there is a typical feature present in the file the present in the image.
Pick up better from that and continue like that.
Here, the artificial limit is pretty simple 3.
Do you decide whether this packet requires inspection?
We have an additional information here that ‘yesterday’ which you can see that it is represented here.
So, again they choose from either upper part or the lower part of the and we assume that it is it is done with equal probability.
And we have seen why a a function like sigmoid is used in some of the algorithms that neural network is using.
Obviously, the pheromone value on path one will be higher.
The game is over.
Hello friends, welcome to Module Five, Heuristic Search Methods in Artificial Intelligence series of modules.
There is something called Depth Bound Depth-first search.
We’ll just look at a typical sequence of states and see if it is a valid state, acceptable one, if not then we’ll pick up the something else and so on, that’s called perturbation search.
So,sometimes a normal rule of thumb Schank used in his paper he referred somewhere in his paper that whenever he encountered at least two heads, Okay in headers he’ll invoke that script.
And there are total paths, I have drawn all possible paths on the screen.
Is it valid?
And that that’ll help in generalization, because if you identify features irrespective of the input, the pixel value is, it it becomes possible, it it it makes it possible to generalize.
Free X and Free Y.
Which contain two things, the the best move that I take next and the paths, okay the the heuristic value, the complete path and the depth, okay two things.
We’re picking up the best child.
How converting one state into another requires complex processing.
Similarly, the carnivorous animals also, okay they can only survive if they run fast and they are better okay.
And then again you let them meet and generate twenty in the next iteration, I have already talked about.
The object is tears and it has direction relationship.
Why we do that?
Generate a random number R between zero and one, okay .
Now you can easily conclude that I must have much lesser than five hundred rupees by now, why because one of the requirements of dining in restaurant that you'll have to pay your bills.
We are not taking the earlier string.
Okay , because action always applies in forward direction.
That is what is is going to remain the same everywhere.
So you can see that the call is made to to MiniMax.
So we have a table which actually summaries summarizes all the primitives and their work.
Do you believe that the script watching a match will be invoked?
Now here is precisely what I'm doing.
You can just pour it inside and get it empty.
We we generate okay .
The third thing which I would like to talk about is I I use typical arrows, typical type of links which suits…which I found from those papers.
I can move to eight,zero,zero, .
One ply search is shown on in inferior twenty point one, it is it is shown you can see that A is explored and it's a max ply because it is the only one ply search you just play or move and get all straights possible.
What does it mean?
And you can see that for on BA you can add action called place on top BA and on A table you can put on table and now this is done.
In fact it can answer many many questions.
Okay , there's something called conceptual tense, which comes next there are single letter letter indicators, Okay , conceptual tenses for example, slash indicates negation, P indicates past tense, question mark indicates something which the information is not available, a kind of a placeholder, later, later on you might encounter, for example, you you encounter a statement like Sachin went to LA and then you probably will have a statement coming message, Sachin bought a a a necklace for his wife in Mumbai two days before.
One, is a three gallon water jug, the other one is four gallon water jug and we have ample supply of water.
okay , these words probably we are not going to use them anywhere else.
You can see that there are total eighty-one inputs out of it, some of them are zeros and some of them are one.
Okay .
This task is a prerequisite will have to be delayed.
And this is something which I've already explained.
We are multiplying it with minus one and pass it up. Why we are doing it?
For example, we decide that X, Y and Z needs to be achieved for going from a start state to the end state.
Not only that, it's kind of pick keeping the best so far node as well.
So that is how we do it like that is called constructive search.
Similarly, you can write, you can see the move, which moves from right to left.
At L Gr grain is also on the left hand side.
That sometimes happens due to radiation or some external this thing also, input also.
Farmer or not farmer?
Now, you can see that.
So we use that thing as a heuristic.
When I say I run or Milkha Singh ran, what does that mean?
So it's not the question who can, everybody.
we are now into twenty ninth module of AI .
You can move that piece forward.
In the initial chess movement, for example, youre youre moving across, you won't look at all moves okay .
Is a is a separate discipline today.
ACO is applied at many places including solving a vehicle routing problem, assignment problem, set problems, image processing where you need to process in highly parallel fashion.
Remember, we discussed about forward and backward planning, when we are using forward planning, we we use progression to move towards goal state and in backward planning we use this thing the regression okay .
Because if I if I if I just say, for example, A, B, C, D, I cut.
It just have some set of constraints.
The manoeuvering process itself is called search.
What we want is to have the problem in the final state once we completely solve that problem.
Okay One very simple way of doing it.
okay So, with this almost have completed MiniMax algorithm.
When we study heuristics, we’ll study it further but here let me tell you why it is not so.
So, it cannot even solve that problem.
You can use that thing as an algorithm or heuristic.
So it will happen a few times.
How many times you were wrong?
How they use a pheromone here?
And we have seen in fact, we have hinted that one can use heuristic to determine which move is better than the other , which we are going to address in the next module.
We have seen that how CD different rules of CD can can be used to represent statements.
For example, if you have seven that is seven minus one factorial, six factorial, okay that is seven twenty.
So out of that you choose the best okay maximum pheromone value and go ahead and go ahead means you pick up the next segment and the next stegment okay .
Most of of the cases what we do is we provide a cap, say that when it reaches ninety percent, nine point nine , we accept that thing or minus point one then you accept that thing as well.
And the other one is eight five three gallon milk jug problem.
One more way is to like for example let us take the same missionary cannibal case.
So, in the next rollout, they they they make all these changes and next version they change.
Every input unit or neuron is connected to every middle unit, okay .
Just look at the hidden unit which it it just look at 3 hidden units.
You can look at this example.
For example, chess, you have a a branching factor of around thirty five.
So you get the farmer on the left hand side again.
The ‘reason’ is terrorists attacked Mumbai.
So there is no point exploring J.
So, they share this information.
In some case, it it it goes beyond million.
So, that's what this MOP does and there is something called PAM which is based on planning.
So, that is represented here that this conceptualization, which is which is vertical, ‘Sachin PTRANS Sachin to plane.
How do we do that?
Eventually out of million possible cases it just sorts out small range of small set of those chemical compounds in which geologists can actually work on.
okay And that's very important.
If if you have if you have seen exactly what I’ve done in the previous case depth bound, you explore the tree and then the next cycle, you explore that tree again and then the next level sounds wasteful.
But that's not that simple, we’ll see how how how to proceed using that.
So, you can see that in a relation called POSS-BY or possessed by Sachin’s elbow.
‘Manoj had a chocolate.
I was talking about if you if you use some heuristic to find the shorter paths before.
Now, what is the state space?
I am not going to discuss that thing right now.
If you get a solution, that solution is optimum, not only that the advantage you don’t need to have the amount of memory that you’ll have that you’ll require in BFS.
So, either one or two person can carry that boat.
It is pretty simple.
What we want is obviously A to be on table.
Eventually it will reach to us and we'll looking at which will decide which out of which four children that we have which one is better for us.
So that’s a very good example of how one can use generate and test.
How have you done it?
Okay Now what you do is basically you store this T value in three column table.
Okay so what does that mean?
How they are merged is based on a method called crossover.
And it is also called tolerance level.
Solution search can be done in either way.
How you can solve a travelling salesman problem using the ant colony optimization?
So when you default is obviously a few, but whenever you encounter other information, you may add others Okay .
If it's not a leaf node what should it be doing?
But but the scripts are basically like this very example but it's still a very good example for you to understand different stakeholders of this thing, Okay .
Milkha Singh ran fast.
They are not inputs.
That is sigmoid function, which you can see drawn on the second slide, okay .
In fact, you can easily see that the other requirement is available, which will be moving actually.It is a cycle.
So, Unguided Search Methods are not all that useless kind of , they are quite useful, so we are going to discuss that.
One expert gives ten percent weightage to a component, some other will give twenty percent of this thing .
So there are many factors.
To write that we have used complex notations which are pretty hard to write.
The security person asked him to stand in a queue. There was heavy rush on the ticket counter and the queues are very, very long.
If I have five nodes and for example if you combine one and five and generate a new solution or new two new solutions basically think of it,
So, that can be easily assumed Okay .
Incrementing that by one and converting Player into the other player and also negating the values.
So, that is very, very critical part of this thing.
Now the first statement, first line which says L one two four eight and R zero zero zero zero, what does it mean?
So, transition finished and TS transition starting, commencement and conclusion, both are possible.
Now there are some pheromone values available.
They are added on the right hand side.
That is little confusing, but sometimes it is possible.
But technical functionality, testing, quality assurance is also a very, very important critical part of every system.
We have looked at some of the prerequisites, we have looked at labeling as W L and draw.
Chess is again a very, very hard problem because it contains so many moves.
The users are denying, users are denied of their services.
So, when you're throwing or or when you're kicking something or or doing something where you you apply physical force, you're talking about propel.
But then there is one more important issue.
It will actually for example, it'll generate hundred possible moves and out of that it explores only first twenty.
How we do that is explained here.
So, there is no so you've deleted something which is not part of the goal state so second condition is also satisfied.
In in case of progression, a a relevant progression is where it removes something which exist in start state but not in the goal state and it adds something which is not there in the start state but there in the goal state.
So what you’re doing?
So, the first one is 3,5,0.
Now, such a move is not very good.
But when I'm talking about bank in the context of a picnic, it’s basically a riverbank.
okay clears nose And similarly, M two is greater or equal to C two and M two equal to zero okay otherwise.
If we’re only picking up unexplored nodes what’s the point in storing explored nodes?
So, that is again an example.
So it begins with NULL but when it goes up, it adds to, it add that thing .
And what is being expelled?
Let us first of all, talk about those prerequisites.
We’ll look at how it happens in this particular module.
So, when I'm reading basically, it MTRANSING information from that newspaper to CP and once CP reads it, it might use short term memory for processing it and then transfer that thing into long term memory.
Depth first iterative deepening works like that.
So, that is susbtracted and then union is with free C and free D.
You can see that we we have some, we have to have some qualities to survive and those who have better qualities have better chances of survival
So I travel along one path and I get the distance from A to Z using that path is say thirty-five.
The problem itself moving from one state, for example, moving from Ahmedabad to to Vadodra how how you do that.
And that's why, it is possible to build programs which can play chess.
And it's good.
So if you're going down, down, down, and you it is quite possible that you allow a bad move and move to a little worse state but you still have remembered the good state, so you can always go back to that state.
So, people started thinking that neural networks cannot solve this problem.
Now we assume that this is an end, we’ll not go further.
Now this thing which we have looked at is very, very important.
So what we do is we begin with random set of weights and somehow make sure that these weights are changed over a period of time and converged into the set which gives us the right combination, right answer for every input that we provide.
So, nothing then it is present tense.
The first layer, connects to every unit of the second layer, the unit or neuron or number of neurons.
Second one is 5,0,3 Okay .
cough So these are examples of entry conditions.
The candidates for that thing so, they’re best actually and so we’re we’re always looking at best nodes.
These are the only three things the ants are doing, and they can share the information and this is the simplest way of sharing this information.
So, this is one thing which is indicated by rule number six.
One typical solution of farmer, fox, chicken, grain problem is shown.
There's going to be a database coder, who is going to design database for it.
Empty i,j minus two.
How do you do?
When you approach positive infinity, it approaches one.
That’s the first step.
Okay , so that essence is not captured by the language, it's not the limitation of CD , the CD is actually derived from that language.
Unlike the conventional system, this is a major difference here.
Because when number of missionaries become zero, you can have number of cannibals as two or three, no problem because they're not going to eat that missionary.
It is not searching through the search spaces,
In real world as I said, were sent out to survive on their own, those who survive only will meet with the others and get better offspring.
For example, if you encounter a statement like Jay asked for Italian pizza with double cheese, he waited for fifteen minutes, got angry and went away.
You can see on the next slide, now it is little, the PowerPoint animation is running, so better better try to see how it works.
We’ll look at the first method and that method is again pretty simple.
So we stop.
In database design, probably if you've gone through a database paper, you know that there is a problem called knowledge redundancy.
One more is called ATTEND, now when you focus your sense, sensing organ to to something for example when I'm reading, I'm focusing my eyes on newspaper or when I'm listening I'm I’m focusing my ear on the other party's words and whatever so, the in all these cases.
okay ,
We’ll never get two values which are equal.
Same as hill climbing, nothing different.
Okay So, that is a very typical problem that I've taken.
Our our movement actually places A on the table.
Winding part that you’ve written does not happen first here, happens in the last function, last function which is involved, that unwinding part happens there, then the next to next, then the next to next and so on and at the end you'll come to the first function which is being called.
You choose if there is a dead end you can always try the other path.
That is exactly what happens in in in some cases artificial worlds are created where the solutions are sent and then will pick up those who survive and so so on.
That’s the first thing.
So you you know, the direction from Mumbai to Los Angeles and so on so forth.
okay , A is already there so we have a cycle.
Okay , so technically there is no difference.
You probably read this or look at the PowerPoint slide to read more about and understand, because I've given a lot of examples of intrusion detection system and other systems in in my discussion, which I couldn't do it here, because because of the time constraint.
So, it is not Fr not fx not chicken not grain what does that mean?
It is one kind of, is is one type of engineering, one engineering discipline actually.
But the the second one we’ll have a chance to win, okay if the opponent makes mistake.
What if there is a function called H dash which which just negates that value? What you get is a lower value.
Nothing is flawless in this world and CD is not no exception.
So that that sometimes it chooses a non-optimal path as well and that helped it come out of that local minima or maxima issue, like the simulated annealing okay .
Similarly, number of cannibals which are C, substracted from the left hand side and added on the right hand side.
Let us begin with the description of progression.
The because he's an opponent and you can see that there are some winning already okay .
But okay , but the case number one is A is good B is not very good C is comparatively better than B because B when we are playing B we don't have any like one part is already full.
So, two raised to five you can have total thirty two combinations which can which is good for for example, all zeros will be one, all zeros but the last one is B and all zero but the fourth one is C and so on, so forth.
There are some ways of doing it and we will see how GA is applied. okay .Let us see.
okay The other example
But anyway, we are we are not discussing that part right now.
There is no central authority, unlike computer processors.
It just sums up things.
deep breath We have used variables like X, Y and Z .
There are sometimes other functions used, we’ll be looking at few other functions in due course.
We have seen to it's hard to write preconditions.
Opponent would like to go further because draw is not all that important for it it’ll go further and try to get L.
Those scripts and it is quite possible that two different scripts contain many things in common and they are not represented exactly the same way and so on so forth.
What they tried to do is they tried to learn the neurons, how the neurons of brains have functioning and tried to mimic the very neuron in in the computer domain that is called artificial neuron.
And you you do that further probing how experts decide and what are the past record indicates.
It says that Ravan is dead because the reason for that is Ram Ram has done something to him okay or poisoned him. Whatever.
So, that's what we are learning right now.
So I I don't need to worry about that rule, okay .
That’s why this is called unsupervised learning which is also quite quite important, and many a times this unsupervised learning is as a as a process pre-process for the supervised learning.
In fact, in some cases the mapping is is you will have to cycle that mapping in fact if you map the first element is already occurred then you you have to again map, so it is sometimes in some cases it is pretty complex but we have we taken a very, very simple case here to just make you understand how partially mapped crossover works.
set of rules again in this case, we could write with them in many other cases, we'll be talking about them for...for .
The heuristic function exactly tells you the value, Okay .
Okay . But in that, it believe me in fact, that’s what we are going to see that some typical types of moves are better than others, but we do not know that thing right now, and that’s why we'll we are using Unguided Search.
The the amount of we have already travelled okay so that we have value which is known and that that is not an estimate of anything.
Now, this is again an example of fuzzy logic like representation.
The third one is minus three and fourth one is minus two.
Eventually, from this previous state you will go to this goal state so our actual working is on this direction.
We don't really know.
They have to be three.
Now that that love can appear in many ways.
What is to be added?
So, there are alternate paths also and there are alternate execution of the sequences of these scenes also and so on so forth.
Virtual infinity is obviously not infinity but then real time you’ll not be able to handle that, so that’s also it's called virtual infinity.
But then a diligent reader would ask a question; how do the system learn that Epicurean is a restaurant?
How many times when you say that if I take a packet for deep inspection and I'm right that this packet is really malicious and this deep inspection reveals it.

Artificial intelligence
Artificial intelligence (AI), is intelligence demonstrated by machines, unlike the natural intelligence displayed by humans and animals.
Artificial intelligence (AI) is the area of computer science which is sometimes described as machine intelligence.
Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1955, and in the years since has experienced several waves of optimism, followed by disappointment and the loss of funding (known as an AI winter), followed by new approaches, success and renewed funding.
As a newbie to chatbots, I had to Google every fifth word to translate the developer talk into something more normal in order to get the gist of it.

Even though machine translation solutions are developing all the time, it must be kept in mind that the translations they produce are not completely free of errors.
Faintly superimposing such a pattern on a legitimate image results in an adversarial image that the system misclassifies.
Fallback
Example one , in a bee hive , there are many thousands of workers bee that all serve one queen bee .
So , if you look at the structure of deoxyribose you will see that at carbon two the hydroxyl group has been replaced by a hydrogen group and because the hydroxyl group has been replaced by hydrogen group the sugar is called as deoxyribose which is an important component of D N A .
He coined the term epigenetics .
This makes the arteries stiff and obstruct the blood flow .
Most important point is the daunomycin does not recognize any specific base sequence as N three of guanine and O two of cytosine both are non - specific .

So , monosaccharides can also undergo certain kind of modifications and one such modification leads to the generation of deoxy sugars .
So the molecules are separated that depends upon the sedimentation coefficient of the molecule , we describe that the rate at which the micro molecule sediment under a defined gravitational four force which is influenced by the molecular weight of the substance and the shape and the shape of the micro molecule .
Perturbation could be a stress condition which could have triggered alterations in lipid content and you can monitor the alterations in lipid content and their composition by performing a lipidomic study .
Secondly , being hydrophobic in nature triacylglycerols are stored in an anhydrous form as oppose to glycogen which is normally stored in its hydrated form .
They give you the full structure of the protein with atom to atom distances, atom-atom interactions and so on.
But there is no space for the phosphate to move out .
Once , you got the ninhydrin derived amino acid so how to quantify them and this peak issue , and this is the actually the elusion profile of the standard amino acid using any technique , it basically people use the ion exchange chromatography or even you can H P L C .

However , Robertson ’ s statement was merely meant to describe a common structure .
A ligand can be defined as a molecule which can trigger a conformational change in a protein or any other macro molecule , which lead to a array of biological signals .
Similarly, tertiary structure, similarly quaternary structure, so these examples will make you understand and appreciate that the structure at different levels of the protein can lead to disease so that is why this is this class is on relation to health and disease.
It can also be used for quality control to monitor quality of food , water , soil and air and chromatography is routinely used in research , it is used for purifying proteins , peptides and other small molecules .
Here , you can here how the cyanogen bromides actually cleaves the mechanism of cyanogen bromide derived , cyanogen bromide does the degradation of a polypeptide , you can see here in a in a polypeptide that containing methionine residue .
This is the glycosidic linkage .
Hydrate formation: Due to high dielectric constant, it has a very strong hydrating tendency.
Oxygen binding of the affinity of the Hb is related to acidity , one parameter that helps is the two , three B P G but more importantly Bohr curve actually helps in understanding the effect of pH because CO two if the peripheral tissues actually is actually releases the you know makes the CO two plus water becomes the bicarbonate ion and that has to be also be released .
Now , coming to their functions .
On the right side you see the cartoon representation of Leu transporter with the leucine bound at the substrate .
What are inter-molecular interactions?
Electrostatic forces or salt bridges: Electrostatic interactions generally provided about 40 kilo joules per mole of stabilization per salt bridge.

For example , saturated fats are considered bad fats .
Three of the rings have six carbons , while one of the ring has five carbon .
Since , this is the unstable in nature so it so it try to break the bond and consequently it breaks the peptide bonds , nearest peptide bond .
So , the point to be noted here , what you really have to note here is that the solvent system comprises of both non - polar as well as polar organic solvents in order to ensure that both non - polar as well as polar lipids come into the solvent system .
Bacterial cell wall contains structural hetero polysaccharides which provide rigidity to the bacterial cell wall and this rigid component of the bacterial cell wall is called a peptidoglycan which contains alternating units of n - acetyl glucosamine and n - acetylmuramic acid as we will see in a minute .
So , again this is shown in the same thing , what I explained to you earlier that the KA is much much higher than KA three much higher than K two and much higher than K one .
In this particular case the long axis of D N A C six pyrimidine and C eight purine is usually parallel to the long axis in the drug and the dimensions of the ligand are usually similar or closed to the D N A base pair geometry .
So , the answer to the question as to why the beta anomer of glucose predominates in the aqueous solution as opposed to the alpha anomer lies in a examining the chair conformation of the alpha and beta glucopyranose structures .
So the to to make economical to the cell, the cell has evolved in such a way that actually the D N A forms a supercoiled structures and also circular D N A .
The objectives of this module is to learn the organization of protein structure , like a primary structure , secondary structure , tertiary structure and quaternary structures and what are the forces that stabilize a protein structure .

So they made the complex of G L U T three transporter with the maltose sugar .
We will then have a look at the , how monosaccharides are used as building blocks for building up long chain carbohydrates .
So , bonds that are parallel to the plane of the ring are called as equatorial and bonds that are perpendicular to the plane of the pyranose ring are called as axial bonds .
So , let ’ s just have a look at what are the different functions that these steroid hormones perform in the human body .
So , you see the beta phosphate of the A T P bound at the dipole helix .
So , by now we have already discussed one class of glycoconjugate which was proteoglycans .
So, this is what you have done in the week seven.
They also speculated the presence of certain bridges between the outer and inner protein layers through which certain materials are exchanged between a cell and its environment .
Some of the molecules passed through the column quickly due to their inclusion in the mobile phase by other lag behind as they are accumulated in the stationary phase .
So , transporter carbohydrate complex .

will also learn about Myosin structure , power stroke and the structural changes in myosin in the process of power stroke .
They are Phe, Val, Thr, Trp, Met, Leu, Isoleucine, Lysine and Histidine
In type two i plus one is minus sixty twenty , again it is a beta sheet region it is allowed and whereas the i plus two is eighty zero so it ' s a positive , both positive so it ' s not allowed .
They get oxidized because of the presence of the hydrogen atom in the aldehyde group gives reducing property to be aldehyde molecule .
Organism with same D N A sequence such as monozygotic twins and cloned animals frequently present different phenotypes .
There is a classical or an end - on intercalation model .
These are synthesize as a long precursors about thousand amino acids called pro - collagens with globular extensions about two hundred amino acids at the both ends .

The history of epigenetics is linked with the study of organism , evolution and development .
Chromatography word came from Greek meaning colour writing as method was based on the colourful picture of separation of plant pigments .
So , where you remove the D T T first and urea later , that means you first allowed the disulfide bridges to form and protein to fold .
So , the objectives are that folding of the globular proteins understanding .
That clearly indicates S - S bond is not important in protein folding maybe in the stability .
And , which is present in large amount by weight compared to the other component which we call it as a solute.
The trans fatty acids like I said have high melting points because they provide linearity or they make the fatty acids more linear because of which they can pack very close to each other , just imagine a box of chalks tightly packed , tightly stacked against each other that is how a trans fatty acid will be packed and so it they are solid at room temperatures as compare to the cis fatty acid .
So , activation of microtubule associated protein or microtubule affinity regulating kinase possibly by external insult to the cell like the disruption of intracellular calcium homeostasis by amyloid peptides triggers a phosphorylation of tau and its microtubule binding domain .
As the disease progresses and dopamine generic of neurons continue to be lose these drugs eventually become ineffective ,
As we have seen gangliosides contain N - acetyl neurominic acid which is also called as sialic acid , which imparts a negative charge on these gangliosides and therefore making them acidic .
Here, we start with the bond lengths, bond angle, torsional angle and use a transformation to generate the Cartesian algorithm.
So a monosaccharide for which the axis of the analyzer is rotated in the clock wise direction is designated as plus and is called dextrorotatory , on the contrary if the axis of the analyzer is rotated in the anti - clock wise direction , the monosaccharide is designated as minus
The Conrad Hal Waddington was a British developmental biologist , geneticist , embryologist and philosopher who led the foundation for system biology , epigenetics and evolutionary developmental biology .
This binding of this sugar induces a conformational change in the transporter , as a result the sugar get transported towards the periplasm .
And the the carrier phase can be a mixture of organic solvents depending on what kind of lipids you are interested in looking at .
So , these fragments now can be used to analyze further using N - terminal sequencing , so one by one you can determine the , first you determine the sequence of the fragment followed by the sequence determination of the whole amino acid , whole polypeptide chain .
In this today's module, we have seen first, the conformational flexibility and rotational angles in a poly-peptide chain.
Acetaminophen binds poorly to both C O X - one and C O X - two instead it binds to a third C O X isozyme called C O X - three .
So , we can compare the beta turn conformation of i plus one and i plus two , so we can clearly see that what are the differences here .
A typical example of major groove biding is a thirds D N A strand with a complimentary H - bonding groups , which can wrap around D N A in the major groove and make a triple helix .

So , you can do set of experiments in supporting or disproving the importance of hydrophobic interactions .
This disruption is characterized by “holes ” in the tissue which results spongy structure in the neurons .
Thus, there is minimum repulsion and maximum attraction between the two molecules.
So , in this model we will be discussing about the structure of complex of G L U T three transporter in complex with alpha D glucose .

That clearly says that hydrogen bonds are important for the protein structure and similarly the proteins have a internal architecture like helices and beta sheets .
In the third section , we will discuss about the principle of centrifugation based on the principle types of centrifuge that is the differentials centrifugation , preparative centrifugation and analytical centrifugation .
The bulky regions with valine and tyrosine interrupt beta sheet and allow the stretchiness .
So , the material or particles in a solution can be separated by a centrifuge that used in principle for the centrifugation .
And then you can take that fragments and now load to the mass spectrometer , so due the deflect , you can see here , the it a if you generate the high voltage , the molecule is deflected , the deflection time is actually collected at how it will take to get from the their origin side to the to the detector .
So , this consensus sequence is Serine - Glycine - X - Glycine and so if serine is part of this consensus this becomes the point of attachment for the G A Gs to the core protein .
There are several lifestyle factors have been identified that might modify epigenetic patterns such as diet , obesity , physical activity , tobacco smoking , alcohol consumption , environmental pollutants , psychological stress , and working on night shifts , etc .
So, the first class is on the introduction to the nucleic components of the nucleic acid.
So , you can see the structure of cellulose here , the so the monomeric unit is glucose like I said and the linkage is beta one to four glycosidic linkage .
So , you you can you can see that it directly depends upon the radius and the R P M and there is a direct correlation between the R P M and R C F .
So , how do these fatty acids usually exist in the cell ?
A loss in peak efficiency can be observed as a wide analyte band and therefore , these three terms can also be viewed as factors that contribute to band broadening .
So, with this at this stage you will know that you have a protein for which the structure has to be written.
And loop regions are generally very flexible and can can adopt many different conformations .
So there are different classes of lipids such as fatty acids , triacylglycerols , glycerophospholipids which are also known as phospholipids , sphingolipids , steroids such as cholesterol and there is another class of lipids that is classified as others which includes components like waxes , terpenes and eicosanoids .
The first component , the motor where it it the rotors are fitted to centrifuge the molecule , here you can see the timer that is actually controls , you should define that at how long the centrifugal process should be done .
But , if you want to determine the amino acid sequence , it is a very difficult task and it although there are several techniques are available .
Now , it has a low affinity for confirmation , basically de - oxy hemoglobin which is present , so it just leaves the oxygen , dissociates and therefore , it becomes a de - oxy hemoglobin .
So , let us , this slide just summarises the different kinds of functions that oligosaccharides perform when they are part of the glycoconjugate like glycoproteins .
So, when you want to do any experiment under a constant pH or a certain hydrogen ion concentration, you don’t want to, there may be a reaction going on with various interacting molecules then you do not want the buffer to change, the pH to change of the medium you are working on.
And these aqueous acids, bases, molecular compounds, all this compounds can be called a solutes in a water in the aqueous solution.
So, by work accepting the hydrogen ion from the solution, when they are in excess and diluting the hydrogen ion when they have to be displaced.
In other words , it helps the membrane from turning too much .
There are different type of mechanism that control epigenetics as we discussed in the module .
So , if you design any inhibitors which can slow down the uptake or it inhibit the function of the G L U T , then we can kill the malignant cells .
So , both these groups that are depicted in circle are point in the axial position , so these groups , because they point in the axial position and they are bulky , what will happen is they will bump into each other as their electron densities will repel each other , so just keeping this in mind let us just again go back to the structures of alpha D - glucopyranose and beta D - glucopyranose in the chair conformation and let us just again have a look at the placement of the hydroxyl group in both these chair conformations of glucopyranose .
Hope you understand this modules and if you have any questions , please contact us .
Now , another question I would like to ask is why only one percent of activity is retained when you allow the DT to disulfide bridges to form first ?
That means concentration of the one liquid, which is present in another then it is called the percentage by volume that means both are present in volume.
So , using this technique mixtures of fatty acids with various degrees of unsaturation and different chain lengths can be resolved .
The precise function of PrP is still not very clear .
Bathochromicity is a shift towards higher wavelength or red shift .
Since , glyceraldehyde has one asymmetric carbon atom , so if you apply this formula to glyceraldehyde the number of possible stereoisomers that glyceraldehyde can have is two raise to the power one , which means two possible stereoisomers as we see in this figure here .
Fats and oils are also classified as simple lipids because they contain triacylglycerols .
So , t dash R is equal to tR minus tM .

Where you can it can work very well from six to eight,
So , polysaccharides synthesis differs from protein synthesis in these the aspects that I have mentioned here .
So , monosaccharides link through glycosidic linkages to generate polysaccharides .
Study of thermodynamic properties of ethanes and other molecules indicate that this rotations are not free, but have barriers.
Prions are misfolded proteins that influence the properly folded counterparts to the same misfolded structure , which are similar to them .
And you can see there is a clear difference between the subdomain two .
Because of this free rotation these fatty acids can attain a wide range of conformations .
but you can do the same experiment with pre - proinsulin and it can fold back similar to ribonuclease but whereas if you do the same experiment with mature insulin it cannot be folded back because disulfide bridges are between the two polypeptides .
Parkinson ’ s disease traditionally has been considered as a non - genetic disorder , but about fifteen percent of individual with P D Parkinson ’ s disease have first degree relative who has this disease .
So there the pH effect comes into play .
And it is released from this ester linkage by the action of phospholipase A two .

So , three dimensional structures of these polysaccharides can be described in terms of the dihedral angles phi and psi about the glycosidic bonds .
So , galactolipids are also important constituents of cell membranes but they are predominantly present in the plant cell membranes .
but actually instead of these agents P E G and glycerol denaturing the protein , they actually stabilize the protein .
Maltose is also considered as a exofacial competitor for D glucose .
So , let ’ s just briefly go through certain characteristics of all polysaccharides .
This clumping nature is nothing but a a precipitation or insoluble formation that leads to the antigen antibody reaction , which is very important to know the concentration of antigen or antibody in a biological fluid .
Here the phenylisothiocyanate are used , so phenylisothiocyanate are reagent which can be used for the determination of N - terminal sequencing , you can see here that the phenylisothiocyanate forms a strong , reacts a strongly with the amine group of the of the amino , of the polypeptide , you can see here because this carbon is attached to nitrogen and sulphur , so it is the electron deficient species .
Euchromatin is the region where D N A is accessible , representing an open conformation due to the relaxed state of nucleosome arrangement .
The three dimensional structure of these isoforms are very similar but the C O X - two active site channel is approximately twenty percent larger in volume than C O X - one due to amino acid differences between them .
And note here that the this solvent system is , has non - polar solvents as well as polar solvents which will ensure the extraction of all types of lipids from the tissue .
So , this is a detail all about the low - speed centrifuge .
So you can here that since this amino acid having one arginine and two lysine , it means it having the three potential side which should be cleaved by the trypsin .
And as the time increases , as a length of the polymer increases , somewhere in the middle the ATP is dissociated .
It is linear unbranched homopolysaccharide of D - glucose where the glucose monomers are linked by a beta one to four glycosidic linkage .
In much similar way, I have provided two examples, hydrogen fluoride and water.
So , all these things are having a correlation with each other , ultimately if you know the sequence then only you can determine the or you understand the evolution process in the better way while generating the phylogenetic tree using the sequences of the related proteins from the different organism combined together and derived the information that how the things are evolved together .
For each side chain dihedral angle , the coordinates of four atoms are required .
For example , lysophosphatidic acid which is generated in vivo in the membranes of platelets does not undergo further degradation , but instead serves as a inducer of cell growth during wound repair process in the damage cells .
So , even though different side chains they should have a similar structure like alpha helix and beta sheets.
It is longer, it has a length of two point one angstrom.
Classical examples would be sodium, iron, aluminium, silver and copper.
But the small loops with regular hydrogen bond pattern and specific dihedral angles are termed as turns .
They will also weaken the ionic and hydrogen interactions between lipids and membrane proteins .
Say , when we say carbon - carbon distance is one point five four Angstroms it is not exactly one point five four Angstroms all the time .
In the unsaturated fatty acids , a common pattern exists in the location of the double bonds .
This is basically done using energy from an electricity source.
The polar compounds will be retained on the column for a very long time if they are applied directly .
Attempts to build artificial membranes provided insight into the structure of real membranes and this elucidation came into the picture when Irving Langmuir in nineteen seventeen discovered that phospholipids dissolved in benzene would form a film on water after the benzene evaporation from the system .
So , you can see that , although the chemical analysis is very easy but it is applied only to a certain sequence length because of the data becomes more hazy and more complicated if you increase the , if you want to determine the more number of peptide .
Okay , I have one question from you .
In this table you see that the saturated fatty acids here that are listed differ in the number of carbon residues in their hydrocarbon chain .

One example of an amino sugar is N - acetylneuraminic acid which is also called as sialic acid .
Another way you can always say as the temperature increases the hydrophobic interactions become stronger but in the case of proteins as the temperature increases the protein denature .
And this lattice formation is a one , which finally gives the agglutination , whereas the precipitation reaction and activation of the complements .
At pi the molecule will have a charge but the net charge is zero.
So if you have to separate lysolecithin from saturated hydrocarbon in a in adsorption chromatography and if you are using solvents of increasing polarity to elute these two compounds , the least polar lipid will emerge in the early fraction because you are using a you are using a gradient solvent system with increasing polarity .
So , the simplest simple lipid is basically a triacylglycerol .
Welcome to Swayam.

Hence , anomerization may not be required for that D glucose transporter by G L U T s , either it can be G L U T one to G L U T four or G L U T twelve .
Such committed alterations are called epigenetics , because they are heritable in the short term but do not encompass mutations of the D N A itself .
The features of the landscape including the hills and valleys , the genes and string and the points with where which each path branches are important to Waddington ’ s argument .
So the mole fraction, one, it's important when you are doing in a kind of a, mole fraction it has its own advantages.
Subsequent helices side by side the e and g come head to head , so these could be hydrophobic as well as hydrophilic , they could be , so hydrophobic , they form hydrophobic interaction , if they are hydrophilic either they form hydrogen bond or ionic interactions .
One of the most interesting designing strategy was given by Dervan ' s group , these were called Isolexins .
Sucrose is another example of disaccharide .
However , you can see as you come to the cytochrome , it evolves at very high speed as compared to histone and then further the haemoglobin , then further the fibrinpeptides .
So , you always find a left handed a beta sheet twist in the protein structures .
So , the basic definition of a polymer is that a polymer means many somethings or many mers , okay ?
What are the simple way to analyze the phylogenetic analysis like the starting point ?
The two sheet beta helix which has about eighteen amino acids , which is a repetition of nine amino acids , so it has a glycine and aspartic acid rich , so the two glycines , any amino acid , another glycine any amino acid , aspartic acid and etcetera .
And also the third class, we have done the polypeptide structures and protein structures using the Ramachandran plot, the most fundamental to understand the protein structure.
The beta sheet fibers are strong as well as flexible .
Physical properties of water: Hydrogen bonds make water cohesive.
Let ’ s now move on to the heteropolysaccharides and start with the glycose amino glycans as one of the examples of heteropolysaccharides .
Now , another kind of a lipoprotein , which generally good lipoprotein or sometimes good cholesterol is high density lipoprotein .
The link around the glycosidic bond is normally fixed .
Because the importance of the folding is so much that , if it is the protein is unfolded or it is partially folded which will not take into which will not do its normal cellular function .
So , if upon oxidation the aldehyde group is oxidized , it it is converted to carboxyl group , in that case the molecule that you get from D glucose is called D - gluconic acid .
So , the frictional force is given as frictional f is proportional to the small f and to v .
So , the next glycine and the next helix comes after a few degrees which is listed here .
The beta sheets as I said , you need two or more sheets to form a beta sheets , so these sheets could be a parallel or antiparallel .
The fluid mosaic model of cell membrane , it is still the widely accepted model .
Water is oxidized to oxygen during photosynthesis, a very important phenomena that takes place the leaves of plants and trees wherein carbon dioxide combines with water to give rise to glucose, water and oxygen.
So the pathological association because of the loss of the structure can be very well understood by taking the example of hemoglobin and myoglobin .
Actually , the Z form of D N A was first discovered in the C D spectroscopic studies by Paul and Jovic and you got two spectra which are shown on the left hand side B - D N A which is shown in a continuous line and Z - D N A in a dotted.
Now, find out points or combinations within one kilo cal per mole from the lowest energy and join this by contours.
you can use any graphics program and explore the structure yourself .
The upper fifty kilo Dalton domain and the lower fifty kilo Dalton domain is close and open as nucleotide is bound or its bound to actin .
So , a mixture of chloroform , methanol and water is the most commonly used organic solvent mixture that is used for extraction of lipids from tissues .
But the turns which are the short form of the loops which are generally conserved and have a specific hydrogen bond pattern , so the short turns , short loops makes them turns and they become they are highly conserved .
So , if you make the osazone , what you are basically doing is , you are basically able to now crystalize the sugar or you are able to obtain the sugar in the crystalized form .
So , you have three phi psi and could be nine different families who can be classified and like any other turn , the first and the last are residue of the turn from the hydrogen bond , here i and i plus four , so there are too many sub - groups of alpha turn which we won ’ t go into details but you should have an idea about alpha turn .
Angle Chi five is formed , seen only in the case of arginine , C delta N epsilon C zeta Nh eta .
The monosaccharides can be divided into aldoses and ketoses .
Today , I am going to discuss about a module , conformational properties of polypeptides and Ramachandran plot under the paper biomolecules and their interactions .
So, remember that carbohydrates and lipids are important.
Normally , all B - D N A structures are with the mono - nucleotide repeats , only Z - D N A has a dinucleotide repeat .
And since due to mutarotation between the alpha and the beta forms , these alpha and beta forms can interconvert .
So, with that I would like to summarise the the...the module, what we have learnt is about the solution.
So , here you can see the process of evolution of organism after one organism or one gene after gene during the course of time , however , in taxonomy it is based only on the ,
Secondly , you will find that cholesterol esters and triglycerides are present inside core of low density lipoproteins .
Due to this S L C six that is means salute carrier six neurotransmitter A four polymorphism .
On the basis of increasing density , there are different types of lipoproteins present in our blood .
What is a pi?
There are several actin binding proteins participate in actin dynamics that is moving from G state to F state .
With the exception of alpha amino proline these have a hydrogen atom, which is attached to C alpha atom, which accounts for the third valence of C alpha atom.
The beta turns are sub - classified on the basis of the conformation of i plus one and i plus two , which are crucial and on the basis of these the conformation of beta turns are classified .
So, lot of molecules, small molecules only are targeted to the minor groove of D N A .
Once the lipids have been separated by these various chromatographic methods , the last step that you would need to do is to see the kind of fatty acids that are present in the extract .
So , Parkin is a part of this complex helps to degrade the proteins which are toxic to neurons .
Now , it it is treated with the cyanogen bromide so you have the three fragments C one , C two , C three .
So , when an aqueous solution of bromine is added to solution that contains an aldose , the bromine which is reddish brown in color is converted , becomes colorless , while the aldose sugar if it is a glucose it is converted to aldonic acid , so glucose will be converted to gluconic acid .
in lysine it is defined as C beta C gamma C delta C epsilon .
This module is placed in paper ‘ Membrane Biophysics ’ .
So one can design such molecules , long flexible molecules with proper curvatures .
In paper chromatography , the mixture of substances which are to be separated is spotted on the paper and then it is developed by organic solvent , the molecules which has got more solubility in the organic solvent , according to the solubility they get separated .
So , to make a short turn we need to have a glycine at that specific position to bring back the two secondary structures come close together by a short loop or a short turn .
The linear polarized light that you see here which which comes out after it has passed through the polarizer is actually a result of a super possession of two components that can , that counter rotate , okay ?
So the aqueous solution can be very dilute or it could be medium, medium dilute or it could be a strong, like I have shown you in the picture that the extreme this thing is dilute, the central one is not so dilute but then again you have a concentrated solution or a strong solution.
So , students let us now summarize what we have learnt in this module .
Similarly, tertiary structure, there are number of examples if the structural conditions are not and then quaternary structure and so on.
Starch and glycogen on the other hand are storage polysaccharides , we have already seen that with alpha glycosidically linked glucose residues .
Now, examples also I have given here that you can calculate of the same this thing, that is C C l four you can calculate both molar and molal.
The amount and concentration are related by volume .
The most fundamental is the X-ray crystallography.
And if you have a sera which contains amount of the antigen , then once the fixed amount of antigen or fixed amount of antibody reacts gives rise to a complex .
On the contrary , the Gram - negative bacteria have thin cell wall that is covered by a complex outer membrane .
So having given this particular introduction we now go on to understanding chemical bond.
The loops are rich in glycine and generally have a aspartic acid and because they have negative charged aspartic acid they are seem to bound calcium ions .
In the week two, you studied the globular proteins.
These are pyrole rings connected by peptide bonds .
The latest technology which is being revolutionized the immunology or serology is the flow cytometry .
And major factor is helices when they are exposed out to the solvent , and most of the global and protein far the alpha helices are exposed to the solvent , the alpha helix bend to form a curved structure so that it can interact with more water and form hydrogen bonds and due to which you have a curved alpha helical structures .
So , anything that increases the concentration of A B peptides , increases the possibility of formation of these protofibrils of misfolded protein which will seed and initiate the aggregation cascade .
In this case , the amides of each drug molecule are hydrogen bonded to the minor groove base atoms of one D N A strand .
So , the carbonyl group and side chain of the same amino acids are perpendicular to each other .
Distamycin shows anticancer activity .
Hemoglobin is a tetrameric and the hole function of the cellular function of hemoglobin comes only because of the tetrameric structure and this slide shows the Max Perutz structure that is presented by them that contains four myoglobin like subunits , each one is like a myoglobin , alpha , beta and secondary structure folds and active site is there , heme pockets are also there which are all similar to myoglobin .
that puts an object in a rotation around the fixed axis and applying a force perpendicular to the axis .
So , unlike enantiomers the difference between enantiomers and diastereoisomers is that while enantiomers are non - super imposable mirror images of each other , the diastereoisomers are not mirror images of each other .
Then we will discuss about the mass spectrometry technique that is used for the sequence determination of a polypeptide chain , chain and then at the last we will discuss about the how protein sequence is helped you to understand the evolution process and the function of the protein .
We have also seen example for the LeuT along with the drug complexes .
So , this polar hydroxyl group provides its polarity , while the fused rings along with the alkyl side chain provides its it provide the non - polarity to the cholesterol molecule and therefore cholesterol is considered to be an amphipathic molecule that provides structural integrity to the cell membrane .
So that will be doing in the next week.
So , the two histidines which play important role , one is the proximal and the other is the distal .
How efficiently this buffer is working? Which buffer you have to choose under what conditions? Whether it needs, it serves your needs or not.
So these essential fatty acids are so called because they cannot be synthesized by humans , hence , they are obtained from the diet .
So , the direction of hydrogen from one electronegative atom should be in the same plane as the next electronegative atom the two electrons are there .
But a whole lot of study have undergone to decipher the structure of the cell membranes .

So , once you have this plate , the test sample is applied as a spot or a thin band at one end of the plate .
So, it could be concentration presented in grams, but in true terms it has to be expressed in Daltons not grams and also mole: that is amount of the substance that has a mass in grams numerically equivalent to that of a molecular weight.
This helix actually enters into the groove between one and three of another actin just above that and that ’ s how the F - actin is formed .
But, protein chemistry is a part of proteomics rather.
I think you are facing the problem to read these lines in proper way .
Co-ordinate bond is usually indicated by an arrow, the arrow that is indicated points from the atom donating the lone pair to the atom that is accepting it.
If you are interested in separating a mixture of glycolipids and sulpholipids , then the preferred solvent system would be chloroform and acetone in one is to one ratio .
A classical example is sodium chloride in water.
Loops and turns – As we discussed before loops are large and have a multiple and flexible conformation .

So , it is actually the measures of the R C F versus the path length of the tube .
They explained theoretical plates as an equilibrium partitioning of solute between stationary phase and mobile phase .
So , students let ' s see what are we going to learn from this module ?
But anything other than the alpha helix or beta sheet, we generally call the, it is in random coil.
For example, in case of ethane the three fold torsional potential is shown in this picture and it is represented by the same equation half K phi , where K phi is the barrier to the rotation and phi is the Dihedral angle.
Out of 21 amino acids only histidine has side chain pK value in the physiological range of six to seven point five.
Okay , so on the right side you see two figures , where , one you see the interaction of maltose which is shown in cyan .
Then you get ninety nine percent of the activity retained .
So , you can see here since all these amino acids are present singly , so you see the peak intensity or peak height is the , having a particular level .

So, when you talk about you know a simple terms never the less it needs a mention in the beginning.
So , the sugar is said to be reducing if the anomeric carbon is not involved in the formation of the glycosidic bonds .
The more dominant forces in the protein structure is hydrophobic interactions where many atoms which do not have charge hydrophobic by themselves describe that water repelling properties or water phobic properties .
Hence , using the structural information , we can screen for inhibitors which are longer , which can block the transporter , either it can be a sugar inhibitors or it can be a molecules which are hydrophobic , which can recognise the particular tryptophan three eighty six , which we see in the structural complex of G L U T three with glucose transporter and maltose transporter .

So , that if the energy is reduced that is a favourable interaction and if the energy is not reduced , if it is goes up it is unfavourable interaction .
In the entire immunoelectrophoresis or various immunological techniques I talked to you , the most important conclusion I want to give to you is the the antigen antibody reaction is non - covalent interaction and the antigen should contain multivalents , whereas the antibody should could be divalent , then only the immunological reaction or serology can be achieved .
So , lipid binds at the hydrophobic channel .
Now, let’s come to different units that we have express.
Water has high specific heat because a lot of heat energy is required to break hydrogen bonds.
Van der Waals radii prevent them from packing closely to each other , so this loose packing in fact is making these unsaturated fatty acids more flexible and fluid .
Now , the once the ATP is enters into the myosin the myosin detaches from the actin because the upper fifty kilo Dalton domain which moves closure to the N terminal domain and the upper fifty , lower fifty cleft opens up , this causes dissociation of myosin from the actin .

So , in this the alternative residues or hydrophobic residues that go inside the core of the protein and alternative residues and the beta sheets are on the surface , they are exposed to the outside .
Amino acid sequence that is the primary structure of protein controls the folding
So when they open the transmembrane helices they are marked the substrates like here in case of maltose transporter , the maltose gets inside the transmembrane helices , when the hydrolysis happened at this nucleotide binding domain , they again move away , further away , with the moment of this nucleotide binding domain makes the transmembrane domain to close .
Polypeptides usually contain fifty or less than fifty amino acids, these are extremely important in many reaction and connect us to the proteins from which they originate.
because it doesn’t interact with so many other you know in biological situations it is better to use phosphate buffer.

If you talk about phospholipids , they are contributing around twenty - five percent , while free hydroxylated cholesterol contributes around fifteen percent and proteins are coming as twenty - two percent .
One ATP is hydrolyzed for one step it takes , so when myosin binds to actin the cleft between upper and lower fifty kilo Dalton domain which closes and the nucleotide binding domain between the N terminal domain and upper fifty kilo Dalton domain which opens up .
So , so far we have seen how important fatty acids are and we have also now looked at the different kind of fatty acids that exist in the cell .
The difference between the two is that only one mouse was deprived of important nutrients called methylators like vitamin B twelve and folic acid and ended up becoming obese while the other mouse was given all of the essential nutrients and remain lean and healthy .
The model could not explain the permeability of certain substances through the membrane .
Chemistry is the scientific discipline involved with elements and compounds composed of atoms, molecules and ions: their composition, structure, properties, behavior and the changes they undergo during a reaction with other substances.
In the scope of its subject, chemistry occupies an intermediate position between physics and biology.
It is sometimes called the central science because it provides a foundation for understanding both basic and applied scientific disciplines at a fundamental level.
For example, chemistry explains aspects of plant chemistry (botany), the formation of igneous rocks (geology), how atmospheric ozone is formed and how environmental pollutants are degraded (ecologn), the properties of the soil on the moon (cosmochemistry), how medications work (pharmacology), and how to collect DNA evidence at a crime scene (forensics).
Chemistry addresses topics such as how atoms and molecules interact via chemical bonds to form new chemical compounds.
There are four types of chemical bonds: covalent bonds, in which compounds share one or more electron(s); ionic bonds, in which a compound donates one or more electrons to another compound to produce ions (cations and anions); hydrogen bonds; and Van der Waals force bonds.
The word chemistry comes from a modification of the word alchemy, which referred to an earlier set of practices that encompassed elements of chemistry, metallurgy, philosophy, astrology, astronomy, mysticism and medicine.
Alchemy is often seen as linked to the quest to turn lead or other base metals into gold, though alchemists were also interested in many of the questions of modern chemistry.
The modern word alchemy in turn is derived from the Arabic word al-kīmīā (الكیمیاء).
In origin, the term is borrowed from the Greek χημία or χημεία.
This may have Egyptian origins since al-kīmīā is derived from the Greek χημία, which is in turn derived from the word Kemet, which is the ancient name of Egypt in the Egyptian language.
Alternately, al-kīmīā may derive from χημεία, meaning "cast together".
The current model of atomic structure is the quantum mechanical model.
Traditional chemistry starts with the study of elementary particles, atoms, molecules, substances, metals, crystals and other aggregates of matter.
Matter can be studied in solid, liquid, gas and plasma states, in isolation or in combination.
The interactions, reactions and transformations that are studied in chemistry are usually the result of interactions between atoms, leading to rearrangements of the chemical bonds which hold atoms together.
Such behaviors are studied in a chemistry laboratory.
The chemistry laboratory stereotypically uses various forms of laboratory glassware.
However glassware is not central to chemistry, and a great deal of experimental (as well as applied/industrial) chemistry is done without it.
A chemical reaction is a transformation of some substances into one or more different substances.
The basis of such a chemical transformation is the rearrangement of electrons in the chemical bonds between atoms.
It can be symbolically depicted through a chemical equation, which usually involves atoms as subjects.
The number of atoms on the left and the right in the equation for a chemical transformation is equal.
When the number of atoms on either side is unequal, the transformation is referred to as a nuclear reaction or radioactive decay.
The type of chemical reactions a substance may undergo and the energy changes that may accompany it are constrained by certain basic rules, known as chemical laws.
Energy and entropy considerations are invariably important in almost all chemical studies.
Chemical substances are classified in terms of their structure, phase, as well as their chemical compositions.
They can be analyzed using the tools of chemical analysis, e.g. spectroscopy and chromatography.
Scientists engaged in chemical research are known as chemists.
Most chemists specialize in one or more sub-disciplines.
Several concepts are essential for the study of chemistry; some of them are:
In chemistry, matter is defined as anything that has rest mass and volume (it takes up space) and is made up of particles.
The particles that make up matter have rest mass as well – not all particles have rest mass, such as the photon.
Matter can be a pure chemical substance or a mixture of substances.
The atom is the basic unit of chemistry.
It consists of a dense core called the atomic nucleus surrounded by a space occupied by an electron cloud.
The nucleus is made up of positively charged protons and uncharged neutrons (together called nucleons), while the electron cloud consists of negatively charged electrons which orbit the nucleus.
In a neutral atom, the negatively charged electrons balance out the positive charge of the protons.
The nucleus is dense; the mass of a nucleon is approximately 1,836 times that of an electron, yet the radius of an atom is about 10,000 times that of its nucleus.
The atom is also the smallest entity that can be envisaged to retain the chemical properties of the element, such as electronegativity, ionization potential, preferred oxidation state(s), coordination number, and preferred types of bonds to form (e.g., metallic, ionic, covalent).
A chemical element is a pure substance which is composed of a single type of atom, characterized by its particular number of protons in the nuclei of its atoms, known as the atomic number and represented by the symbol Z.
The mass number is the sum of the number of protons and neutrons in a nucleus.
Although all the nuclei of all atoms belonging to one element will have the same atomic number, they may not necessarily have the same mass number; atoms of an element which have different mass numbers are known as isotopes.
For example, all atoms with 6 protons in their nuclei are atoms of the chemical element carbon, but atoms of carbon may have mass numbers of 12 or 13.
The standard presentation of the chemical elements is in the periodic table, which orders elements by atomic number.
The periodic table is arranged in groups, or columns, and periods, or rows.
The periodic table is useful in identifying periodic trends.
A compound is a pure chemical substance composed of more than one element.
The properties of a compound bear little similarity to those of its elements.
The standard nomenclature of compounds is set by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC).
Organic compounds are named according to the organic nomenclature system.
The names for inorganic compounds are created according to the inorganic nomenclature system.
When a compound has more than one component, then they are divided into two classes, the electropositive and the electronegative components.
In addition the Chemical Abstracts Service has devised a method to index chemical substances.
In this scheme each chemical substance is identifiable by a number known as its CAS registry number.
A molecule is the smallest indivisible portion of a pure chemical substance that has its unique set of chemical properties, that is, its potential to undergo a certain set of chemical reactions with other substances.
However, this definition only works well for substances that are composed of molecules, which is not true of many substances (see below).
Molecules are typically a set of atoms bound together by covalent bonds, such that the structure is electrically neutral and all valence electrons are paired with other electrons either in bonds or in lone pairs.
Thus, molecules exist as electrically neutral units, unlike ions.
When this rule is broken, giving the "molecule" a charge, the result is sometimes named a molecular ion or a polyatomic ion.
However, the discrete and separate nature of the molecular concept usually requires that molecular ions be present only in well-separated form, such as a directed beam in a vacuum in a mass spectrometer.
Charged polyatomic collections residing in solids (for example, common sulfate or nitrate ions) are generally not considered "molecules" in chemistry.
Some molecules contain one or more unpaired electrons, creating radicals.
Most radicals are comparatively reactive, but some, such as nitric oxide (NO) can be stable.
The "inert" or noble gas elements (helium, neon, argon, krypton, xenon and radon) are composed of lone atoms as their smallest discrete unit, but the other isolated chemical elements consist of either molecules or networks of atoms bonded to each other in some way.
Identifiable molecules compose familiar substances such as water, air, and many organic compounds like alcohol, sugar, gasoline, and the various pharmaceuticals.
However, not all substances or chemical compounds consist of discrete molecules, and indeed most of the solid substances that make up the solid crust, mantle, and core of the Earth are chemical compounds without molecules.
These other types of substances, such as ionic compounds and network solids, are organized in such a way as to lack the existence of identifiable molecules per se.
Instead, these substances are discussed in terms of formula units or unit cells as the smallest repeating structure within the substance.
Examples of such substances are mineral salts (such as table salt), solids like carbon and diamond, metals, and familiar silica and silicate minerals such as quartz and granite.
One of the main characteristics of a molecule is its geometry often called its structure.
While the structure of diatomic, triatomic or tetra-atomic molecules may be trivial, (linear, angular pyramidal etc.) the structure of polyatomic molecules, that are constituted of more than six atoms (of several elements) can be crucial for its chemical nature.
A chemical substance is a kind of matter with a definite composition and set of properties.
A collection of substances is called a mixture.
Examples of mixtures are air and alloys.
The mole is a unit of measurement that denotes an amount of substance (also called chemical amount).
One mole is defined to contain exactly 6.
02214076×1023 particles (atoms, molecules, ions, or electrons), where the number of particles per mole is known as the Avogadro constant.
Molar concentration is the amount of a particular substance per volume of solution, and is commonly reported in mol/dm3.
In addition to the specific chemical properties that distinguish different chemical classifications, chemicals can exist in several phases.
For the most part, the chemical classifications are independent of these bulk phase classifications; however, some more exotic phases are incompatible with certain chemical properties.
A phase is a set of states of a chemical system that have similar bulk structural properties, over a range of conditions, such as pressure or temperature.
Physical properties, such as density and refractive index tend to fall within values characteristic of the phase.
The phase of matter is defined by the phase transition, which is when energy put into or taken out of the system goes into rearranging the structure of the system, instead of changing the bulk conditions.
Sometimes the distinction between phases can be continuous instead of having a discrete boundary' in this case the matter is considered to be in a supercritical state.
When three states meet based on the conditions, it is known as a triple point and since this is invariant, it is a convenient way to define a set of conditions.
The most familiar examples of phases are solids, liquids, and gases.
Many substances exhibit multiple solid phases.
For example, there are three phases of solid iron (alpha, gamma, and delta) that vary based on temperature and pressure.
A principal difference between solid phases is the crystal structure, or arrangement, of the atoms.
Another phase commonly encountered in the study of chemistry is the aqueous phase, which is the state of substances dissolved in aqueous solution (that is, in water).
Less familiar phases include plasmas, Bose–Einstein condensates and fermionic condensates and the paramagnetic and ferromagnetic phases of magnetic materials.
While most familiar phases deal with three-dimensional systems, it is also possible to define analogs in two-dimensional systems, which has received attention for its relevance to systems in biology.
Atoms sticking together in molecules or crystals are said to be bonded with one another.
A chemical bond may be visualized as the multipole balance between the positive charges in the nuclei and the negative charges oscillating about them.
More than simple attraction and repulsion, the energies and distributions characterize the availability of an electron to bond to another atom.
A chemical bond can be a covalent bond, an ionic bond, a hydrogen bond or just because of Van der Waals force.

POLICY OUTLINE
This Government under the leadership of Dr . Kalaignar, Hon‟ble Chief Minister of Tamilnadu, is giving top priority to the development of road Infrastructure facilities in Tamil Nadu .
A separate Highways Department exclusively to develop roads and bridges was formed in April 1946 .
The Highways Department is very well carrying out road development works as per the IRC Standards in such a way to fulfil the demands of ever increasing vehicular traffic and the demands of road users .
This department has been renamed and functioning in the name of Highways & Minor Ports Department from 2008 . The Government has evolved the following twenty policies for this department .

To improve the Minor Ports in Tamilnadu through Private investment thereby creating opportunities for its development .
To provide ferry service by sea to the tourists visiting Kanyakumari .
To undertake the transportation of coal required for the Thermal Power Plants of TNEB, through ships .
Classification of Government Roads
National Highways
The Central Government has declared those stretches which have heavy traffic intensity and connect different State capitals, Major Ports, large industrial areas and tourist centres as National Highways .
In Tamil Nadu, the length of National Highways which was 4,254 in 2006 has increased to 4,873 Km at present .
This Department undertakes the works of improving, maintaining and renewing in 1,613 Km length of National Highways, with the funds provided by Central Government .
The National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) is undertaking directly the works of widening and improving of two lane with paved shoulders (10 m width), four lane and six lane in the balance 3,260 Km length of roads .
State Highways
The stretches which have heavy traffic intensity next only to National Highways are declared as State Highways by the State Government .
These roads link district headquarters, important towns and the National Highways in the State and neighbouring States .
In Tamil Nadu, the length of State Highways which was 6,849 Km . in 2006, has now increased to 9,384 Km due to up-gradation of different kinds of stretches during the past four years after assumption of office by this Government .
As per the policy of the Government to widen all the State Highways to a minimum of two lane(7 m . width), except the 32 km . single lane stretches in Forest area which does not pertain to Highways Department, all the remaining stretches have been widened as follows:-

PENSION AND OTHER BENEFITS TO FREEDOM FIGHTERS AND EX-INA PERSONNEL
The Government of Tamil Nadu has always given top priority in extending facilities to the Freedom Fighters and their families, who had participated in the freedom struggle of our country .
The Government have introduced and are earnestly implementing a number of Welfare Schemes such as Freedom Fighters Pension, Family pension, Medical facilities, Free Transport facilities, priority in Government employment and allotment of houses effectively .
The Freedom Fighters Pension scheme was first implemented in the State with effect from 1 . 10 . 1966 .
As per the above scheme, Freedom Fighters who were sentenced to imprisonment or held under detention for not less than three months or who were killed in action or who became permanently incapacitated due to firing or lathi charge during their participation in the National Freedom Movement, are eligible to get Freedom Fighters Pension .
This scheme had been extended to the Ex-INA personnel and persons who participated in Naval Mutiny in 1946 and those who suffered imprisonment in Madurai Conspiracy case .
Further such of those Freedom Fighters, who have gone underground evading the arrest or those whose properties were confiscated / attached or who were terminated from service due to their participation in the freedom movement, were also brought under the eligibility criterion to receive Freedom Fighter Pension .
The period of three months of imprisonment that was fixed as one of the eligibility criteria for getting pension was reduced to three weeks with effect from 1 . 4 . 1980 .
The income ceiling originally fixed was also removed with effect from 11 . 3 . 1983 .
The Government have further liberalised the procedure for sanction of Freedom Fighters Pension .
For instance, instead of proof of imprisonment / jail records, a ‘Co-prisoner’ certificate obtained from the Legislators who served during the period 1980 or before was accepted as evidence for jail imprisonment with effect from 1 . 4 . 1980 .
Since some deficiencies in the above system were brought to the notice of the Government, the system of issuing co-prisoners certificate by the MLAs was modified during the year 1988 .
As per the orders dated 16 . 11 . 1988 issued by the Public (Political Pension) Department, an applicant may obtain co-prisoner's certificates from any two of the fifteen Freedom Fighters authorised to issue such co-prisoner's certificates throughout the State and apply for pension .
Further, the Government set up a District Level Screening Committee in each District as per the orders of the Public Department dated 7th February 1996, consisting of the Collector of the District as Chairman, the District Revenue Officer, as Vice-Chairman, three prominent freedom fighters as members .
The applicant, who makes a claim for getting freedom fighter pension, should have completed 18 years of age at the time of imprisonment and also should submit one co-prisoner certificate from any one of the authorised certifiers of the concerned district .
These cases are then examined by the District Level Screening Committee, as per the guidelines issued and are recommended to the Government by the District Collectors .
Thereafter, the Government passes orders sanctioning Pension to the eligible Freedom Fighters .
The pension payable to Freedom Fighters has been enhanced from time to time .
Keeping in view the centenary celebrations of Peraringar Anna and Freedom Fighter Kakkan, the Hon’ble Chief Minister announced in his Independence Day speech on 15 . 08 . 2009 the enhancement of Freedom Fighter’s Pension from Rs . 4,000/- to Rs . 5,000/- per month and family pension from Rs . 2,000/- to Rs . 2,500/-per month with effect from 01 . 09 . 2009 .
In the event of death of any State Freedom Fighter Pensioner, the pension is paid continuously to the wife/husband/minor children of the Freedom Fighter as family pension .
The Government also sanction the continuance of pension to the son/daughter of the freedom fighters who is suffering from any disorder or disability of mind or is physically crippled or disabled so as to render him or her unable to earn a living even after attaining the age of 18 years in the case of the son and 21 years in the case of the daughter till their life .
This family pension scale has been enhanced from time to time .
The details are indicated in Annexure II .
The Government have been sanctioning the special pension to the descendants of eminent persons in recognition of their significant role played by them in the freedom movement .
Under this scheme, the descendants of Sivagangai Marudhu Pandiar Brothers, direct descendants of Veerapandia Kattabomman and eligible descendants of Muthuramalinga Vijaya Raghunatha Sethupathy of Ramanathapuram are receiving pension at the rate of Rs . 500/- per month .
This Government has increased the special pension from Rs . 500/- to Rs . 1,000/- per month with effect from 1 . 12 . 2008 .
Now 132 descendants of Sivagangai Marudhu Pandiar Brothers, 7 direct descendants of Veerapandia Kattabomman and 76 eligible descendants of Muthuramalinga Vijaya Raghunatha Sethupathy of Ramanathapuram are receiving pension at the rate of Rs . 1,000/- p . m .

The establishment matters pertaining to the Tamil Nadu Public Service Commission and Tamil Nadu State Information Commission are looked after by this Department .
SERVICE ASSOCIATIONS
Immediately after formation of the Government, Hon’ble Minister (Electricity) considering the welfare of the Government employees / Teachers held discussions with the office bearers of the recognised Service Associations functioning in the Secretariat Campus viz . , Tamil Nadu Secretariat Association, Tamil Nadu Secretariat Officers’ Association, Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly Reporters’ Association, Tamil Nadu Government Secretariat Drivers’ Association and Tamil Nadu Government Office Assistants and Basic Servants Branch Association on their various demands .
Based on the above discussions, action has been taken on many of the demands of the Associations and final orders have been issued .
Government Staff, Teachers’ and Pensioners’ Welfare
The Government have consistently felt the need for cordial relationship with the Government employees and Teachers since they play a very important role in the functioning of the Government and in carrying the schemes of the Government to general public .
The previous Government had withdrawn the benefits enjoyed by the Government employees and Teachers .
This Government, in addition to the restoration of those benefits, have also extended additional benefits such as - Repealing of TESMA 2003, filling up of vacancies, regularisation of strike period as duty, reducing of qualifying service for full pension from 33 years to 30 years, sanction of Pongal Bonus / Exgratia, sanction of 3 months’ salary as interim relief to all Government Servants including temporary staff and pensioners, payment of VI Pay Commission arrears in 3 equal instalments, increasing the quantum of festival advance from Rs . 1000 to Rs . 2000/- and enhancement of House Building Advance from Rs . 6 lakhs to Rs . 15 lakhs for non-All India Service Officers .
COMMITTEE ON APPEALS
The main source of disappointment for a Government employee arises when he feels that his grievances are not redressed by the authorities quickly .
The speedy disposal of the grievance would provide more faith on the Government by the Government employee .
Therefore, the Government considered that if an effective redressal mechanism on service matters is available, this would eliminate this irritant with the Government Employee and enable him to putforth his best in the duties assigned to him .
Hence, orders have been issued in G . O . (Ms) . No . 157, Personnel and Administrative Reforms (S) Department, dated 02 . 11 . 2009 constituting a Committee by name ‘Committee on Appeals’ with the following members to examine and advice on service matters on which application, appeal, review or revision lies with the Government except disciplinary cases:-

The “Committee on Appeals” shall meet once in a month, on the last Wednesday of the month and examine each petition and record its decision and send it to the departments concerned within a week after the meeting .
Based on the decision of the Committee on Appeals, the administrative department concerned will issue final orders, within 15 days as far as possible, after following the normal procedure of circulation .
ESTIMATE OF VACANCIES
The vacancies for all the posts in the State and Subordinate Services were estimated by the concerned appointing authorities / designated authorities prior to 2001 .
The estimation also included provision for leave vacancies and for unexpected contingencies .
In 2001, orders were issued modifying that estimation should be only for actual retirement vacancies and that there should not be any provision for leave and unexpected contingencies .
It was also ordered that all the estimates of vacancies whether for direct recruitment or for promotion should be cleared by Staff Committee .
Estimation to be cleared by the Staff Committee at the Government level caused unnecessary delay in the estimate of vacancy and preparation of panel .
Non-provision for leave reserve and unexpected contingencies posed problems in filling leave vacancies and unexpected vacancies during the panel year .
In order to obviate these difficulties, the Government issued orders in G . O . (Ms) . No . 123, Personnel and Administrative Reforms Department, dated 10 . 9 . 2009 whereby it was ordered that estimation of vacancies may be done as existed prior to 2001 .
By this, approval of Staff Committee is no longer required for the estimation of vacancy .
Only cases of direct recruitment above certain threshold limits the approval of Staff Committee is necessary .
This has eased the process of filling up promotional vacancies with suitable hands .
DELEGATION OF POWERS TO SECRETARIES OF ADMINISTRATIVE DEPARTMENTS

CHAPTER - I
INTRODUCTION
The Land Revenue had been the main source of revenue for the State since the Sangam age .
The Land tax had been levied based on the type of the Land and the crop yield .
At times, when the land tax was levied exorbitantly the scholars and the poets had played the advisory role by pointing out the defects to the King and had set the Government on the right path .
It is pertinent to note that even in the Sangam age, the poet Piciranthaiyar had given advice to the Pandia King Arivudai Nambi about the taxation system in his poem in 'Pura Nanuru' Cut the paddy corn When it is ripe, And make it into balls of rice, And the yield of a small field, Barely a fraction of a cent, Will feed an elephant For many a day But if the brute Should step into a field, And trampling eat, Even a hundred acres Will not serve, For the feet will spoil More than the mouth could eat . So, if a wise king Levies his taxes justly, His kingdom will yield him millions, And will greatly prosper as well .
An elephant can be fed for many days if the paddy grown even in a single 'Maa' of land (a fraction of an acre) is cut and balls of rice is made properly .
But if the elephant enters itself into the field, even if the Land is very large, then the paddy trampled by the elephant will be much more than the paddy actually consumed by the elephant .
Similarly, if a wise King collects tax from the people following the ethics of taxation then the nation will develop through accumulation of wealth in crore . "
But during the British Colonial Rule ethics of taxation was given up and the tax was increased upto half of the yield following the 'Half-net-principle' with the sole aim of increasing the revenue .
As a result Ryots were affected severely .
Subsequently, though the 'Ryotwari Settlement' was introduced by abolishing the system of tax collection through 'Zamindars' and 'Poligars' it did not ameliorate the burden of tax on Ryots .
With the establishment of the Democratic Government after Independence, a number of land reforms acts were enacted and various public welfare measures were introduced .
In the changed situtation, land tax came to be treated not as a source of revenue for the State, but as yet another documentary evidence of rights and ownership of the pattardars and users of the land .
The Tamil Nadu Government which is pioneer in the Country in implementing land reform measures and various public welfare measures, brought out a major reform last year in the land revenue assessment in the interest of farmers . The Government simplified the procedure and drastically reduced the land revenue for the wet land from Rs . 50 to Rs . 5 per acre and for dry land from Rs . 15 to Rs . 2 per acre and this nominal land revenue is being collected from the Fasli Year 1419, providing greater happiness to the farmers .
Thus with the passage of time, Revenue Department came to be treated not as a department earning Revenue for State but as a 'Public Administration' Department maintaining Law and Order at the District Level besides implementation of various important schemes and Land Administration and Land reform measures .
Further this Department acts as 'a friend in need' for the people by mitigating the sufferings of the people whenever they are affected by natural calamities like cyclone, heavy rains, flood, earth quake, drought, land slide and Tsunami .
In Revenue Department, at the State level, the works are monitored by the Heads of Departments (i . e . ,) Commissioner of Revenue Administration, Commissioner of Land Administration, Commissioner of Land Reforms and Commissioner of Survey and Settlement .
At the district level, under the leadership of the District Collector, revenue functions are discharged by various functionaries including District Revenue Officers, Revenue Divisional Officers, Tahsildars, Revenue Inspectors, Village Administrative Officers and other supporting staff .
By adopting Information Technology, Modern Management Techniques, Digitisation of Field Maps, Web based services, Touch Screen KIOSKS and Common Service Centres Revenue Department continues to serve the public effectively .

TAMIL DEVELOPMENT
POLICY NOTE 2010-2011
Paritimar kalaignar deliberating on the world classical languages observed as follows: Uyar moli is that which is superior in all respects to all other languages prevalent in and around its nation .
Examined in this light Tamil is superior to Telugu and all other Dravidian languages .
Since it is capable of functioning independently, Tamil is fit to be called tani moli .
Since it is an efficient and independent linguistic vehicle of a highly civilized society, Tamil could be a Cemmozhi .
Thus having all such credits, Tamil language is fit to be called Uyar Tani Cemmozhi .
Based on this natural merits of the Tamil language and owing to the incessant efforts of the Govt . of Tamilnadu the Indian Govt at the Centre have recognized the status of our language as a Classical Language of India .
Sangam literatures the classical Tamil literatures are not only an antique but also the unique representative of the cultural exposition of the Tamil society on the whole as well as the motivated artifacts of the experiences of the Tamils .
“26,350 lines from the Sangam compilations are enough to establish that the Tamil is the greatest classical language of the World” – Dr . Kamil Zvelebil

The aforesaid pattern of fostering has traces before sangam period, After the completion of the full growth of the Tamil as a classical one the ancient scholars also used the terminology Centhamizh for this language .
Sangam literature and Tolkappiyam are the unique examples of the aforesaid efforts of the Tamils .
The efforts exerted to provide a classical status could have been started from the time the Kannada language separated from the Tamil language .
The nasalization , construction, sentence pattern of the Tamil language are the fitting examples of the classical status .
The scientifically designed grammatical regulations of the Tamil language are languished by the linguists of today .
Guilbert Slater mentions that , it has attained the classical status and stood as a stumbling example of elucidating the exemplary character of the Dravidian civilization very long ago .
The Primary Classical Language of the World – authored by the great Paavaanar during the year 1966 discussed that the Tamil is the mother of all classical languages of the world .
Above all, Prof . Dr . George . L . Hart of California University defines as below:
The abundance of the words of the Tamil language, its’ subject depth, greatness, subtlety, profundity and the varied scope are unique for the Tamil Language only .
He explained further that among the primitive Indian Literatures prior to the modern literature it is the old Tamil literatures that dates back chronologically had its nucleus that speaks about the depressed and oppressed people of the society .
The universality of attracting the whole humanity by its doctrines lies in this language provide a helm of status to this classical language to treat this on par with other heritage classical languages of the word .
Thus we have the greatest Tamil language in the world arena as our official language .

GREEN ENERGY DEVELOPMENT
Tamil Nadu is blessed with conducive natural metrological and topographical settings for wind energy generation .
Three passes namely, Palghat Pass, Shengottah Pass and Aralvoimozhi pass are endowed with heavy wind flows due to the tunneling effect during South West Monsoon .
The first wind farm of 1 . 165 MW capacity was erected at Mullaikadu in Tuticorin District, during 1986 in association with Tamil Nadu Energy Development Agency (TEDA) under the aid of Ministry of Non Conventional Energy Sources (MNES), Government of India .
Subsequently, various wind farms were erected by TNEB at other places in Kayathar, Muppandal and Puliankulam areas .
Similarly, during the year 1993, 8 Nos . of 250 KW Wind mills were erected at Kethanoor in Coimbatore District .
In all 120 wind mills were erected by TNEB in between 1986 and 1993 totalling to a capacity of 19 . 355 MW .
Based on successful functioning of these demonstration wind farms, coupled with conducive environment created by Government a number of private developers have set up wind farms .
Total capacity during 2008-09 has reached 4287 . 740 MW which has since increased to 4889 . 765 MW in 2009-10 .
The corresponding energy generated has also increased from 6655 . 150 MU during 2008-2009 to 8145 . 508 MU during 2009-2010 .
The installed capacity of wind generation in the state is 44 percent of the total national installed capacity and is ranked 1st in the country .
Solar energy:
The Government of India have recently announced “Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission” in the first phase of which , generation of 1000 MW of solar power has been proposed .
NTPC Vidyut Vyapar Nigam Ltd (NVVN) is to be the nodal agency for entering into power purchase Agreements (PPA) with Solar Power Developers to purchase solar power which will be bundled with the available unallocated Thermal Power of the Government of India & sold to State Power utilities .
NVVN will thus undertake the sale of the bundled power to the State Utilities at the rates determined as per CERC regulations .
When NVVN supplies bundled power to state utilities at the rates determined by CERC, those State utilities will be entitled to use the solar part of the bundled power for meeting their Renewable Purchase Obligations (RPO) under the Electricity Act, 2003 .
The CERC is to issue appropriate guidelines in this regard shortly .
Government of Tamil Nadu has requested the Union Government, Ministry of New & Renewable Energy, to make necessary arrangements for allocating 200-500 MW to Tamil Nadu out of 1000 MW proposed to be sanctioned in the first phase of National Solar Mission .
GROWTH OF GENERATING CAPACITY:
In the past 5 years the state witnessed high economic growth and appreciable improvement in the life style and living standards of its people .
The peak demand has already grown from 8209 MW during 2005-06 to 10180MW during 2009-10 .
Accordingly, the installed Generation Capacity excluding non-conventional power source also has increased from 10031 MW during 2005-06 to 10214 MW .
POWER POSITION:
The following table indicates the sector wise generation, total purchase and gross generation in the preceding five years .
PROJECTED DEMAND AND AVAILABILITY
The availability Vs Lighting peak demand and the deficit for the month of March 2010 to May 2010 are given below:
The deficit is proposed to be met by purchasing power from Private Power producers & also through power exchanges on a day to day basis .
Power scenario from June 2010 to May 2011
The availability Vs demand and the deficit during peak hours (18Hrs to 22 Hrs)
The deficit varies from 1400MW to 3400MW
The availability Vs demand and the deficit during Day time (6 . 00 to 18 . 00 Hrs)
The deficit varies from 1700MW to 3600 MW
The availability Vs demand and the deficit during Off-peak hours ( 22 . 00-6 . 00Hrs)
The deficit varies from 500MW to 2100 MW
REASONS FOR THE POWER SHORTAGE:
Reduced generation from Atomic power Stations at Kalpakkam & Kaiga and Neyveli expansion projects and delay in the commissioning of Kudankulam Atomic Power Plant are some of the chief reasons attributable to the power shortage during 2009-10 .
TNEB was thus forced to impose certain restrictive measures to limit the demand matching with the availability .
STEPS TAKEN TO MITIGATE THE POWER SHORTAGE:
DEMAND SIDE MANAGEMENT:
Considering the present scenario, some of the Restriction and Control Measures in vogue from 28 . 3 . 2010 are:
Demand and Energy cut of 30% for both High Tension Industrial and Commercial consumers .
Evening peak hour restrictions:
The High Tension industrial consumers draw power from the grid during evening peak hours (18 . 00 Hrs . to 22 . 00 Hrs . ) and utilise not more than 5% for lighting and security purposes .
For agriculture three phase supply given for 9 hours .
The agriculturists may operate their pump sets for 9 hours ie . , 6 hours during day time and 3 hours during night time .
Town and district headquarters feeders divided into 4 groups and supply interruption (load shedding) will be done not exceeding 3 hours in day time in rotation . (Except Chennai city and sub-urban areas)
Consequently rural area will be provided with supply for 21 Hours in a day .
The relief realized from the HT Industrial consumers not availing of power during peak hours from the grid except for their lighting and security purposes is considered as 1000 MW .
The relief realized with these R & C Measures during the day time (inclusive of load shedding) would be around 1600 MW . The relief realized with these R & C Measures during the off peak hours would be around 200 MW .
PRESENT POWER SUPPLY :-
The storage in Hydel reservoirs as on 31 . 03 . 10 was 883 . 716 MU as against 733 . 6 MU on the same day last year .
The available water thus is being utilized most judiciously to meet the summer and peak demands
To meet the deficit power is also being procured from the market to the tune of 2000 MW to 2500 MW .
Out of the above, 490 MW to 740 MW is being procured from the Captive Power Plants within the state .
TNEB is also procuring power depending upon the availability, through power exchanges on ‘day ahead’ basis .
Generators within Tamil Nadu are being allowed to sell power to HT consumers through intra- state open access .
Presently this is to the tune of 120 MW .
High Tension Industries also have been permitted to procure power both through inter-state and intra-state open access .
Depending upon the availability of power in the market, action is being taken to procure additional power to bridge the gaps whenever called for .
CAPACITY ADDITION
The projected demand as per 17th Electrical Power Survey for the years 2010-11, 2011-12, 2012- 13 is furnished below:
In order to meet the ever-increasing gap between demand and supply several capacity addition projects are being implemented/ have been proposed during coming years .

MERCHANT POWER PLANTS:
As Tamil Nadu has an advantage of having a large coastline, many private promoters have shown interest to set up Thermal stations using imported coal as fuel termed as ‘Merchant Power Plants’ .
These Merchant Power Plants may approach TNEB for grid connectivity, since as per section 7 of the Electricity Act 2003, a generating station may be established, operated and maintained without obtaining a license under the Act .
These projects could thereafter tie up sale of power in accordance with the provisions of the Electricity Act 2003 and the Tariff Policy 2006 .
Accordingly, TNEB will arrange for intrastate power evacuation arrangements whereas interstate transmission of power shall be arranged by Power Grid Corporation of India Limited, the Central Transmission Utility .
CONSULTANCY SERVICES OFFERED BY T . N . E . B
INDIA BASED NEUTRINO OBSERVATORY PROJECT:
India based Neutrino observatory (INO) project, a prestigious Scientific research project proposed at a cost of Rs . 900 crores is proposed to be located in Bodi West hills, Pottipuram village, Theni district .
Tamil Nadu was selected for this project because the rock in Tamil Nadu hills is of the best quality .
This project is funded by Dept . of Atomic Energy & Dept . of Science & Technology/Government of India and supported by 25 leading scientific research institutions in India .
The research is basically on “Neutrinos’, mass less particles and it is a pure Physics research .
As this fully air-conditioned massive research laboratory is to be located under-ground and is to be housed similar to TNEB’s under ground hydro-electric station at Pykara, approachable through a tunnel of 2 km length, and also as TNEB has executed 36 tunnels of about 105 Km length so far, the preparation of detailed project report on INO project was entrusted to TNEB on cost basis .
TNEB is the consultant and Nodal agency for this project formulation and facilitator in tying up all the requisite infrastructures for these underground laboratories and over ground residential quarters, office and guest house etc .
At any point of time, about 100 Scientists will work in the under ground laboratories .
Due to setting up of this ultra modern scientific research laboratory in Theni district and research centre subsequently, the scientific research in the colleges of Madurai and Theni district will get a boost .
ALLOTMENT OF CAPTIVE COAL MINES:
As of now, TNEB needs about 15 Million Tonnes of coal annually for generating power from its four thermal power stations with a total installed capacity of 2970 MW, out of which around 13 Million Tonnes of coal is being supplied by Government of India .
Therefore as advised by GoI to meet the shortfall in supply, about 2 Million tonnes of coal per annum is being imported .
In addition, as a permanent measure to meet the ever-existing shortfall in the supply of indigenous coal, it was felt necessary to go in for acquisition of captive coal mines .
Accordingly upon request made to GoI, TNEB has been allotted two coal blocks viz . , Gare pelma sector II coal block in the state of Chattisgarh alongwith the Maharastra State Mining Corporation and Mandakini B coal block in the state of Orissa alongwith Orissa, Assam & Megalaya State Mining Corporations .
Gare pelma sector II coal block:
A Joint venture company “ Mahatamil Collieries Ltd” (MTCL) has since been incorporated jointly by TNEB and Maharashtra State Mining Corporation Limited (MSMCL) for development of the Gare pelma sector II coal block in Chattisgarh State and also putting up a pit head power plant of about 2000 MW .
The total reserves of the block are about 768 Million tonnes wherein TNEB’s share is approximately 593 Million tonnes and MSMCL’s share is about 175 Million tonnes .
The Joint venture company has applied for the prospective license .
The prospective license has to be obtained for the area of allotted block to be explored .
The MTCL has entered into an Agreement with Minerals Exploration Corporation Limited (MECL) a Government of India public sector undertaking under the Ministry of Mines on 11 . 3 . 2010 for the work of detailed exploration of the Gare pelma sector II coal block and preparation of mining plan at a cost of Rs 37 . 10 crores .
TNEB’s share of coal from the mine will be around 10 Million tonnes per annum .
As the development of the mine is at the initial stage, production in the mine is likely to commence only from Dec 2014 .
Considering the huge expenditure in transportation and logistical issues involved in transportation of coal from the Gare pelma sector II coal block, it is proposed to install a pithead power generating station using the coal received from this mine .
The MTCL Board has decided to call for a tender for selection of Mining cum Developing Operator for the exploitation of coal as well as selecting a power developer for the utilization of TNEB’s share of coal from the Gare pelma sector II coal block .
Action is being taken in this regard and the notice inviting tender will be published shortly .
Mandakini B coal block:
A Joint Venture Company “Mandakini B Coal Corporation Limited” (MCCL) has been formed between Orissa Mining Corporation Limited, TNEB, Meghalaya Mineral Development Corporation Limited & Assam Mineral Development Corporation Limited for development of Mandakini B coal block allotted jointly by Ministry of coal .
The total reserves of the block are 1200 Million tonnes wherein TNEB’s share is 300 Million tonnes .
The MCCL has applied for the prospective license .
The prospective license has to be obtained for the area of allotted block to be explored .
For obtaining prospective license the MCCL should obtain forest clearance from Ministry Of Environment and Forests .
The MCCL has issued the work order on 30 . 01 . 10 to Central Mine Planning & Design Institute Limited (CMPDIL), Ranchi, another Central Power Sector Undertaking under the Ministry Of Coal, on nomination basis at a cost of Rs . 80 crores for the work of detailed exploration, preparation of geological report and other planning services which are likely to be completed within 27 months from the commencement of the exploration at site .
The share of coal from the mine will be around 2 . 5 to 3 Million tonnes per annum .
As the development of this mine also is at the initial stages the mine production is likely to commence from July 2014 .
The mined coal to be received from the Mandakini B coal Block will be utilized for Ennore Thermal Power Project Annex 1x600MW/Udangudi Power Corporation Ltd/ shortfall for the existing Thermal Power Stations .
TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION IMPROVEMENTS
Some of the main objectives of improvements in Transmission & Distribution networks are :
To ensure quality power to consumers
To reduce Transmission & Distribution losses
To establish stable network for supply of power
To fully meet the load growth .
Under Transmission & Distribution network, 78 substations of various voltage categories and 1509 circuit Kms of Extra High Tension lines with an investment of Rs . 554 . 01crores have been added during 2009-10 .
The Transmission & Distribution losses in TNEB as a whole have been estimated at 18% during the year 2009-10 also, considering the units generated, units sold out and by computing the consumption of agricultural and hut services .
The aggregate Technical & Commercial (AT &C) losses in TNEB however have been estimated to be around 19 . 3 . % for the same period, considering the units generated, the units sold and the revenue realized .
TNEB has therefore proposed to undertake the following improvement measures to gradually reduce the Transmission & Distribution losses so as to achieve the targeted reduction in AT&C loss to below 15% by the end of XI Plan:-
To bring in improvements in the High Tension:Low Tension ratio by introducing high voltage distribution system with small capacity transformers
Erection of new substations and Extra High Tension link lines
Installation of Low Tension fixed capacitors, strengthening of distribution lines, replacing defective meters, etc . ,
FLAGSHIP PROGRAMMES:
Government of Tamil Nadu have been implementing the following Flagship programmes of the Government of India:-
RESTRUCTURED ACCELERATED POWER DEVELOPMENT AND REFORMS PROGRAMME (RAPDRP):
The focus of the programme shall be on reduction of Transmission losses and establishment of reliable and automated system for collection of base line data required for energy accounting using information technology
B: RAJIV GANDHI GRAMEEN VIDYUTIKARAN YOJANA (RGGVY) SCHEMES:
The focus of the scheme is 100% electrification of village and rural households .
RESTRUCTURED ACCELERATED POWER DEVELOPMENT AND REFORMS PROGRAMME (RAPDRP)
The Ministry of Power/GoI have launched the Restructured APDRP scheme under the 11th five year plan .
The objectives of the Restructured APDRP Scheme are to provide quality and reliable power supply to the consumers and to bring down the AT&C losses below 15% .
To achieve these objectives, MoP, GoI insist on a holistic -improvement of measuring systems on priority and to strengthen the distribution systems .
The project area will be the towns and cities with a population of more than 30,000 as per 2001 census . In addition, rural areas with heavy loads requiring feeder segregation could also be included in the project areas .
The project will be taken up in two parts where -PART– A will include the projects for establishment of baseline data and Information Technology applications for energy accounting /auditing and Information Technology based consumer service centres
PART- B will include regular distribution strengthening and improvement projects .
Ministry of power, Government of India have sanctioned Detailed Project Reports (DPRs) submitted by TNEB in respect of all the eligible 110 towns for an amount of Rs . 417 Crores and have also released an amount of Rs . 119 . 25 Crores as advance for implementing the scheme under PART- A .
Under the project initially the Government of India will provide 100 percent funds for Part-A and 25 % funds for Part-B projects .
The entire amount of loan and interest for Part-A projects will be converted into grant once the establishment of the required baseline data system has been achieved and verified by an independent agency appointed by Government of India .
During 2010-11, TNEB has proposed to avail the balance amount of the entire Rs . 417 . 00 Crores under part A of RAPDRP scheme for preparing the baseline data for the project areas covering consumer indexing, GIS mapping, metering of Distribution Transformers and feeders and Automatic Data Logging for all Distribution Transformers and feeders and Asset mapping in respect of all the 110 cities and towns qualifying under the project .
PART B: Ministry of Power has given certain definite guidelines for submission of Detailed Project Reports for Part B schemes and accordingly TNEB has submitted 22 DPRs out of which 10 DPRs have been sanctioned for an amount of Rs 103 . 91 crores and proposes to submit the remaining DPRs also by 31 . 5 . 2010 .
The Ministry of Power has released an amount of Rs . 15 . 59 crores as advance .
Under capacity building programme, training for the Class C and D staff of TNEB in the RAPDRP activities has already commenced on 27 . 1 . 2010 .
As per the scheme of things Power Finance Corporation will reimburse the entire training expenditure to TNEB .
On execution of the improvement works contemplated in the restructured APDRP schemes, the AT&C losses are expected to be reduced considerably in the project areas .
Implementation of IT enabled services under the scheme, is also likely to improve consumer satisfaction considerably .
RAJIV GANDHI GRAMEEN VIDYUTIKARAN YOJANA (RGGVY) SCHEMES
Towards achieving the goal of total electrification of households in the rural areas the Ministry of Power, Government of India have launched a scheme named RGGVY Scheme (Rajiv Gandhi Grameen Vidyutikaran Yojana) with the objective of creating Rural Electricity Infrastructure for completing the electrification of all the rural households by 2012 .
Sanction for schemes in respect of 26 districts of Tamil Nadu for an amount of Rs . 447 . 41 Crores in the first phase (out of the schemes posed for 29 districts) has been obtained from Government of India and implementation of the scheme is under process through turnkey contract awarded to M/s . TANSI .
The works envisaged under this scheme will cover installation of 11,284 Nos . 16/25 KVA Distribution Transformers and 45,911 KMs of HT & LT lines for providing access to electricity to all the 16,92,235 Nos . Rural households including 5,24,569 Nos that are Below Poverty Line (BPL) in the state, which presently do not have electricity connections .
This scheme once implemented will not only enhance the coverage of rural households to 95 . 28% but also substantially increase the per capita average annual consumption level to more than 1000 units which is the National goal to be achieved by the end of 11th Five year plan .

Hello!
Everybody.
Welcome to the MOOCs Corporate Law program.
I am Aakriti Kohli researcher, National Law University Delhi.
I hope you guys are learning a lot and reading the other modules as well.
As the present module is in the continuation of the earlier module that was on Mergers, Acquisitions and Takeovers.
I am going to take you through the recent cases of mergers and acquisitions in India.
These cases basically pertain to the year 2014-15 and 16.
Where India had witnessed lot of M&A activities.
The basics of mergers and acquisition has already been covered in the previous module.
I sincerely hope that you people have understood the fundamentals of mergers and acquisitions in India.
Nevertheless as a revision, I would take you through the basic difference that exist between mergers and acquisitions.
If you look at the difference between merger and acquisition, merger is the merging of two organization into one.
Whereas an acquisition is buying one organization by another.
Merger is a mutual decision whether acquisition can be a friendly takeover as well as an hostile one.
Merger is expensive than acquisition because it involves higher legal cost.
However acquisition is less expensive than merger.
Through merger shareholder can increase the net worth whereas in acquisition buyers cannot raise enough capital.
Merger is less time consuming and the company has to maintain so many legal However acquisition is faster and an easier transaction.
In merger, there is dilution of ownership whereas acquisition acquire does not experience the dilution of ownership.
The details of mergers and acquisition has already been discussed in the previous module.
In the present module I am basically going to discuss the recent cases pertaining to the M&A transactions.
So ,the main ones which I am going to cover is related to Sun Pharma and Ranbaxy, PVR and DT Cinemas, Lupin and Gavis, Ola and Taxi for sure and Myntra and Jabong.
Through these cases, you will able to better understand the practicalities of the transaction and also the entities that have been involved the what actually happens when an merger and acquisition takes place.
Which would involve the change in the culture.
That would involve the change in the people, brand, product etc.
So, coming to the first case that is Ranbaxy Laboratories and Sun Pharmaceuticals.
As far as the transaction details are concerned when there is such kind of merger then what would happen? Under this merger has been touted as one of the biggest M&A deals in India.
So under the agreement, Ranbaxy shareholders will receive 0.8 shares of Sun Pharma for each share of Ranbaxy.
This exchange ratio represent and implied volume value of rupees 457 for each Ranbaxy share.
A premium of 18% to Ranbaxy 30 day volume weighted average share price and a premium of rupee of 24.3 % to Ranbaxy’s 60 day volume weighted average share price.
So this is basically what would be Ranbaxy shareholders would get when it merges into Sun Pharma.
And what would be the value of each share which they held previously in Ranbaxy.
Now, the transaction is expected to represent a tax- free exchange to Ranbaxy share holders who are expected to own approximately 14% of the combined company on a pro forma basis.
Why this merger was the need of the hour because it was a crucial time for Ranbaxy.
If we go into the Ranbaxy’s past, you would see company has been incurring significant losses and suffering a decline in net worth since 2011.
Which can be attributed to few key circumstances.
These basically includes settlement amount of US dollar 515 million.
Paid to the U.S. Department of Justice that is D.O.J.
In May 2013, after Civil and criminal charges were lodged against Ranbaxy pertaining to the data and irregularities found in two of its facilities in India.
Thus the merger of the company with Sun Pharma comes at a crucial time when Ranbaxy was already struggling to improve its financial position and many irregularities had also been highlighted.
If you look at the regulatory approval that were involved because as you have read in the previous module for a mergers and acquisition to happen.
They are set of regulatory approvals that are required to be done, either it is from high court or it is from the competition commission or from the registrar office.
By August 2014, Sun Pharma and Ranbaxy had obtained clearances from both the stock exchanges in India NSE and BSE as well as from anti-competitive authorities in all applicable markets except India and US.
The CCI had also interestingly scrutinized this deal and approve the acquisition of Ranbaxy by Sun Pharma on December 5th, 2014 but there were some preconditions that were involved.
Which was that 7 brands constituting less than 1% of the total revenue of the combined entity in India be divested in order to prevent the merger from negatively impacting competition in the market.
So ,there were some divestment that was required to be done.
So that the combined consolidated entity does not become dominant in the relevant market.
On February 2nd, 2014 , both companies announce that US FTC that is the Federal Trade Commission had granted early termination of the waiting period under the hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust improvement Act of 1976.
Coming to the cinemas now, as we all know PVR Cinemas and DT Cinemas.
There was at acquisition that was involved.
This is the India's leading multiplex operator PVR Cinemas which has acquired real estate, DLF cinema which is DT Cinemas for rupees 433 Crores.
Now pursuant to the deal PVR took over the operations of 32 screens of DT Cinemas from June 1.
Initially the deal was for 39 screens valued at 500 Crores, but due to the regulatory tussles and because of the scrutinisation of the deal by Competition Commission of India, the deal had come from 39 screens to 32 screen leading to the the lessening the value of the deal.
This was again a major consolidation that had happened in the recent past.
If you look at the regulatory approval and the competition concerns that are involved.
So, this deal was brought under the CCI scrutiny.
Now the commission had ordered some systematic changes that were to make to be required in the deal.
These include commission and ordered to exclude 2 properties of the DT Cinemas.
This was basically done so that the PVR does not become a dominant entry in most of the markets in Delhi and NCR.
So the commission had ordered to exclude two properties of DT Cinemas that was in DT-Savitri that is 1 screen and DT Saket 6 screens.
So that would remain under the ownership of DT Cinemas and PVR Cinemas will not acquire the same.
That is again a much welcomed order.
The watchdog had also asked the PVR to offload some of its assets in order to approve the transaction.
In pursuance of the order, PVR agreed to scrap its plans.
So there were some new plans for the investments were required to be done by the PVR but for the time being those investments are kept at hold as the commission head specifically asked PVR to delay those investments.
And those investment which were basically under construction projects of PVR which included Garden Galleria Mall in Noida and a 7 screen property at Airia mall in Gurgaon.
PVR has also agreed not to spend in these 2 regions organically or via acquisitions for the rest of 3 years.
As part of the deal, DT Cinemas has been asked by the CCI to sell the other 7 screens in South Delhi to any other competitor except PVR.
So, this is the major, if you see this is an attempt to see that the merging entity does not become dominant in the market.
So Commission has done a really good job by actually suggesting that the PVRs should not acquire particular DT Cinemas which are located in Savitri.
Savitri which is 1 screen and DT Cinemas Saket that is 6 screens.
Now the road ahead, what would be the impact on overall market after this deal.
The impact would be after merger PVR presence will increase to 141 locations with 551 screens in 46 cities across India.
The largest multiplex operator in India now has 519 screens in 133 locations.
PVR will be able to add 7,939 of DT Cinema’s seats, taking its tally to 126 to 672.
Its closest competitor INOX operator over 420 screen followed by Mumbai-headquartered Carnival Films with 330 screens.
So this basically gives you an idea who all will be the major players that will operate in our country after this consolidation and what are the screens that we can expect them to own.
So you can just go through the instant slide and see what is the road ahead that lies for cinemas in our country.
This is another major deal that has happened in the pharmaceutical sector.
Lupin Limited and Gavis Pharmaceuticals and Novel laboratories.
Lupin limited, as you know is one of the large third largest Indian pharma company, which has completed the acquisition of privately held.
So, Gavis Pharmaceutical is a privately held US Pharma company.
So there has been a recent acquisition by Lupin of US privately held Gavis Pharmaceuticals.
Now Lupin has announced this deal to acquire Gavis for dollar 880 million in a bid to strengthen its presence in US market.
So this move of Lupin was mainly to strengthen is present in the US market because there will be lot of synergies involved if Lupin acquires Gavis Pharmaceuticals addition to the manufacturing plant.
The takeover gives Lupin a combined portfolio of 120 US approved generic drugs.
what is the synergy set are involved.
Once the Lupin acquires Gavis Pharmaceutical what will it get? It would get access to 120 us approved generic drugs and 185 pending ANDA applications.
Now what are these ANDA applications? Its abbreviated New Drug Applications, including first 2 file that is FTF products offering 180 day market exclusivity.
These are all the benefits that are involved once a Lupin acquires Gavis.
These are mutual synergies that are always involved in an in a consolidation.
So it would get access to the generic drugs that are being manufactured by Gavis.
It would get access to ANDA applications that have been filed by Gavis.
So this is a huge stake that is involved once the Lupin acquires Gavis and it would have its present in the US market as well.
Now going on to the regulatory approvals, of course it wasn't easy if you look at it the takeover was approved by US FTC on the condition Gavis sold assets for 2 generic products.
Those product are mesalamine and monohydrate to rival G and W.
So, this was mainly done so that once these entities merged, once there consolidated they do not get they they are not in control of most of the generic drugs.
So the control should be given to the other entities as well.
So that the drugs are made accessible to the common man.
Gavis would make mesalamine for G and W and give firm access to knowledgeable production staff to allow the firm to seek FDA approvals for the product.
US FTC felt that the acquisition will be anti-competitive and to preserve competition Lupin and Gavis will have to sell the right and assets for to generic drugs.
Of this one, one is used to treat bacterial infection and other to the ulcerative colitis.
Now what are the outcomes and resulting synergies.
As I have already mentioned whenever there is a merger or an acquisition the resulting synergies or benefits or contributions that are involved for both the entities.
So if you look at the outcome in the resulting synergies, Gavis brings to Lupin a highly skilled US based manufacturing and research organization which would complement its Florida based R and D Centre for inhalation products.
So, of course Lupin would also spread its wings in the US market and Gavis would provide all the necessary facilities that are required for Lupin to access the US drug market.
The combined company will have a portfolio of over 120 in-market products, more than 185 cumulative filings pending approval and a deep pipeline of products under development for the US.
So these are the basics synergies that are involved in this deal.
#Course Name: Corporate LawDirectors, Position, Appointment, Qualification, Power, Duties and Liabilities:My self Dr. Ashish Kumar Srivastava L.L.M. , Ph.D. Assistant Professor Faculty of Law, University of Lucknow will be making this presentation before you.
In this presentation the directors of the companies are the core issue.
As we know that the company is made for maximization of profits by buying and selling goods and services.
And in the process of buying and selling goods and services we need very enthusiastic people who can take decisions in the best interest of the company in a optimum way, for the better management of the wealth as well as the better management of services of the workforce.
So we see the directors and the company stand hand in hand.
The company cannot run without directors because directors are like captain of the ship.
So if the directors are thinking in a similar or in a optimum manner wherein they are the best judge of the interest of the company the company will be smoothly functioning the company will be a profit making company otherwise the company will convert in a white elephant that is a loss making company.
And most of the PSU’s in India we are saying that, they are not doing good because they are not mind by good people.
And good people in corporate governance means the directors only,because the usual diseases which will be taken initially will be taken by the directors and they are subsequently confirmed by the shareholders of the company in the corporate governance process.
So the directors are need for optimum use of corporate resources in the best interest of company and they are very important people in the life of company.
And they being in that positions have huge potential wherein they can misuse their position for their personal and vested interest.
And now we can see that in the corporate governance regime of the India we have different types of directors and these directors get a place on the board of the company and as we know that board of the company just like cabinet in the parliament.
Wherein all important decisions are taken by the board and subsequently ,they are confirmed by the shareholders and we know that the corporate governance process also runs in the same line of the democracy where decisions are taken by rule of majority.
Moving on we will like to see now what would be the learning outcomes by this module.
The learning outcome of this module will be at the end of the module,you will be able to learn that who is the director? What is his position in the company? How a director is appointed in company? What are the qualifications of a director? How a director is removed from his office? What are the powers of a director? What are the duties of a director? What are the liabilities of a director?
Now switching over to the first issue that who is the director of the company.
Now we see that in the company affairs directors hold a very important positions and often they are known as executive of the company.
Some company name them President or Vice President also.
Certain companies name them governors are governing Council members also but you see the Indian Corporate Law therein the term Corporate law that may prescribe for these persons is simply the directors and in the directors we have different categories for different purposes.
But if you try to find out the definition then the old Act was defining the term director in a different way and the new Act is defining the term in a different way.
Now old Act was defining term director in a way wherein a director is any person, who occupies the position of Director, but now the term is defined in a different way and that is director means a director appointed to the Board of a company and this is much more comprehensive than the old definition that was there in the old Act.
So in the new definition we find that any person who is serving the board will be a director of the company.
Moving on if we see that who are the directors actually.
So the directors as the name suggest direct the company, company direct the direction where in the company will be steered for maximization of profit that is essentially the Crux of the definition.
And if we try to analyze the provision that is there in the companies at ,a very large area of sections cover the term director and the different dimensions of directors.
As we know now that only individuals can be appointed as director and Supreme Court in a very important case Oriental Metal Pressing Works Limited versus B.K. Thakoor, analyzed why we should have individual has directed because as I told you that the company is meant for maximization of profit obviously .
But it is also having certain moral obligations like employment like the development of the vicinity where it is situated and tax payment and the overall development of nation by having wealth are creating wealth and contributing to the GDP of the comp of the nation .
That's why Supreme Court hold that because directors play very crucial role in a Corporate Affairs of the company and if they do not take right decisions that would end up the companies in loss making concern.
And those companies are utilizing the corporate capital that is arranged by the shareholders.
So this is the People's money which is going in the corporation and upon which they are having an Empire erected.
And if they are not using it in a proper way they should be held accountable.
So this gives a very clear idea why the directors should be very important persons in the corporate life of the company.
Moving on, now would like to deal with a issue that what is the position of directors in the company? So regarding the position of the directors in the company we can see by three aspects .
The directors are either agents of the company, directors are either the officers of the company, directors are either the trustee of the company.
So in these three areas we can see that directors play very crucial role and because of their crucial role they are depicted as agent or the trustee, or the officers of the company.
So far so agent is concerned as we know in agency the agents are appointed by principal in order to establish, maintain and analyze the relationship of third parties with the principal.
And for that they have necessary authority also.
But in case of the directors, there is no such principle and there is no such appointment as agent.
And their authority with comparison to the agents are much more wide, much more pervasive, that's why actually speaking they look like but actually speaking they are not agents of the companies.
Moving onto the different dimensions about his role or positions in the company they are often termed as the trusties of the company.
As we know that trust is defined in a section 4 of the Indian Trust Act wherein the trust is created by an author for the beneficiaries which is managed by a management trustee.
But here also actually speaking there is no creator and there is no management Trustee role of the directors.
But we can say the directors are a bit ,in a sense it trustee of the company.
Moving on because we have defined now the officers and officers as default in the Companies Act ,new Act that is section 2 subsection 59 to subsection 60 wherein we find later director to be used and these directors are officers of the company .
Being officers of the company they are also held accountable in various sections of the Indian Companies Act.
So we can formally say the directors are officers of the company.
One issue which is left to be dealt with is whether directors are servant of the company or not or directors are the employees of the companies or not.
Speaking legally we can refer a case Lee versus Lee air farming Limited wherein the Lee versus old shareholder of the company as well as he was the director of the company as well as he was the pilot of the company .
So, this case clearly illustrates that the a director can equally be the employee of the company as well as a servant of the company.
If that is not prohibited by the articles of the company.
So, speaking about it director also can be a servant or an employee of the company.
So, this explains the legal positions of the director.
Now about the number of directors they are required in the corporate governance process in public company ,we need to have minimum 3 directors in private minimum 2 and the maximum number is 15 which can be raised by special resolution, if the requirement maybe.
Often we see that there is large size of Board and large size of board is not quite productive also because there may be deadlock in the management.
That's why now the companies Act that has kept the size of the Board very small that is maximum 15 minimum 2 or 3 as the case may be and that gives precisely better accountability ,better transparency in the corporate governance process.
Ones more there is once more provision that one woman director will be there on the board of the company and there will be one minority shareholders director in the board of the company.
So these features are very unique in the new Act wherein the minority director or the woman director will be representative the interest of their class.
So we can see that the Board is an amalgam where ,there are so many people coming in on the Board who are having a representation of so many interest.
Like on we see that now the board is also required to have independent director.
Earlier there was no provision in the Indian companies act regarding independent director but the provision was in the corporate governance class clause 49 of the listing agreement.
If the company is a listed company then the company has to sign a listing agreement wherein, if the chairman of the board is an outsider then the company need to have the one third of the companies as the independent director.
Now if the chairman of the board is an insider then two third of the company need to be the inside independent directors.
Now ,there is provision that out of the Board size one third has to be the independent director.
Moving on the Companies Act , new Companies Act that also provides for a cap regarding the inter-directorship that means that one person can be director in how many companies and the cap there is in case of public and private both companies the total number is 20 companies he can direct at a time.
But in case of public companies where the Enterprises are big he is need to or needed to be have this limit up to 10 companies only.
And this also shows that if your tasks are less you can manage the companies in a better way and most of the companies are turning to the last meeting concerned only because of the miss management on the part of the directors.
Now ,we will see how many types of directors are there in the corporate governance process and we see we have different nomenclature for different purposes and they serve different purposes on the board of the company.
There are interested directors, there are nominee directors, shadow directors, executive directors, non-executive directors, independent directors, celebrity directors, additional director, casual director, alternate director, women director, whole time director, retiring director, deemed director, minority director and managing director and chief managing director.
So, if we see that the vistas of the corporate governance in terms of board of directors is very colorful where all interests are getting representations.
Now we will see the appointment and qualification processes of these directors.
And regarding the appointment of directors there is a help providing by the stock exchanges of the India.
And we have Bombay Stock Exchange which maintains a database where in people can pick and choose the number of independent directors they want to have on the board.
So director database is a service which is maintain by the stock exchange where from people can be picked and choose who has a better knowledge about the corporate affairs of the company that is one thing.
Second requirement is they have to have director identification number in order to get their identity identified and this DIN number are director identification number they have to get and file with the ROC in the company information process.
After that there was a requirement in the old act that was regarding golden shares.
Golden shares basically are qualification shares where in the articles of the company provides that in order to be appointed in the company you are to have certain amount of shares.
But now this new Companies Act do not provide anything regarding qualification of shares are golden shares.
And because of that there is no requirement by the Indian Companies Act for the qualification of shares or qualification shares but if the company wants in order to attach the director with the company emotionally and sentimentally they can provide in the articles for the golden shares.
And golden shares bring better responsibility on the part of companies director.
So these are the affirmative qualifications which the director needs to have in order to get appointed.
Then there are certain disqualifications or negative qualifications which is mentioned in section 164 1 and 2.
164 section 164 of the Indian Companies Act basically provides for the disqualification of the directors wherein if a director has been declared incompetent and he has been declared incompetent in a way that he does not have a sound mind or he is of unsound mind then he will not be appointed as director.
And if he is un-discharged insolvent, if he is convicted for moral turpitude offences for 6 months and the cooling off period that is a 5 years is not elapsed, if he is convicted for serious offences with 7 years imprisonment, if he is disqualified by the National Company Law Tribunal, if he is convicted for related party transactions under section 188, then also he will not be appointed as a director.
And next disqualification is that if he is not responded the calls for the payment of prices regarding the share because we know that calling is a procedure where whenever the demand by the company is made regarding the payment of prices, the shareholder has to pay it.
So if he has defaulted in responding to the calls also he will not be appointed as a director.
Then one more disqualification is that if he has not received the DIN number and without having the DIN number a director identification number he is acting as a director he will be disqualified to be appointed.
Then if he is breaching the inter directorship limit which I have explained earlier that in case of public company he can be appointed directors only in 10 companies and in cases of other he can be maximum up to 20.
So he is breaching this limit he will be disqualified to be appointed as a director.
And then 164 section 164 plus 2 provide final and additional disqualification wherein only people who have a better track regard meaning thereby if they are in a process where in they have directed a company which is a loss making concern then they will not be given further chances.
It will virtually keep them on their toes and the provision is that if a director is a director of company which has defaulted to file its annual financial statement of 3 preceding financial year he will get no chance to be appointed in a new company.
So if we see that these qualifications as well as disqualifications meaning thereby affirmative and negative elements are very important in the appointment process where we are saying that this over people who are academic, who are business minded, who are moral also has a opportunity to direct the company in a better manner.
After having these qualifications as well as disqualification they will be appointed by the shareholders or by the board, or by the National Company Tribunal.
So now we will be dealing with the appointment process and if we see the appointment process of the company we have the three different types of appointment process.
The first is that the appointment by the shareholders.
The second is appointment by the board and the third is appointment by the National Company Law Tribunal or the third parties.
Now dealing with the first appointment by the shareholders: Section 152 of the Indian companies act provides that first directors of the company as the requirement is 2 and 3 in case of public and private they will be appointed by the company within the one year from the data fin corporation.
And if the company fails to appoint then the subscribers of the memorandum shall become the deemed director of the company and they will be also the first director of the company.
And subsequently all the directors will be appointed by the shareholders in a Annual General Meeting or General Body Meeting as we call it.
And in that appointment process one has to be cautious the depending upon the size of board certain reservations has to be made like one third independent directors will be there.
Two third directors of the whole size will be retiring directors.
And rest can be executive directors.
So mostly the executive directors are in house members of the company they are very closely associated for the formation process they are also initiating or furthering because of the company.
They are the in house number and the non executive directors are the IDs basically who are the outsiders and they are there to have better transparency and accountability feature.
Then after this appointment the board of director can also appoint certain directors and they are additional director, alternate director, casual director and this appointment process is discussed in section 161 when in additional director can be appointed when the appointment process by the general body is failed then to fill certain contingency or dis contingency the board of director can appoint directors who will be known as additional directors.
And if there is an absenteeism on the part of a director who is outside India for 3 months then for that we will appoint a alternate director and all other casual or other casual vacancies which is on account of illness on account of death or on account of inability can be filled in by casual directors.
So additional alternate and casual directors will be appointed by the board of directors.
Apart from this if the National Company Law Tribunal finds a situation that there is a miss management on the board then in order to control the management of the board they can also have their directors on the board and they are known as nominee directors.
And that can equally be done by the third parties who are giving loan or any kind of financial assistance to the company because those nominees will be seeing that the fund provided by these third parties are public financial institutions are being utilized for the right and resourceful for the right cause or not.
And whether the fund is not being diverted for the personal use.
So this is the appointment process in the corporate affairs of the company.
Now moving on we will like to deal with vacancy removal and resignation.
So far so resignation is concerned directors are free to resign from the company by signing a letter in writing.
So when they are tendering their resignation the resignation letter will be effected from the date of letter to be issued by them to the company.
And there can be vacancy and removal on certain disqualifications are these certain tainted qualifications which they are having while being appointed and that is mentioned in section 167 which says that a director shall have to vacate the office or shall be removed from the office if he is tainted with any disqualification which is mentioned under section 164 that I already discussed with you that is, if he is declared a person of unsound mind, if is declared and un-discharged insolvent, if is found to be guilty of moral turpitude offences, if is convicted for serious offences.
So for that he will be removed from his office and there will be an automatic vacancy in the office of the director.
And then the next clause is that if he absents himself from the meeting of the board for one year without explaining or without leaving any reason for this.
So in that situation also his office will be taken as automatically vacant and he will be removed from his office.
Next is if he is not disclosing his material interesting transactions with the companies having with a third party and if he appears to be an interested director then he is liable to vacate the office and he may be removed from the office as is mentioned in section 184 of the act.
He can equally be removed or his office will be vacant if he is disqualified by the National Company Law Tribunal if the Tribunal finds out that the company was being managed by person whose morals are not sound.
Moving on we will now deal with the powers of the board of directors and directors.
If we see the powers of the directors then the corporate life is basically having too many things and in that corporate life we have certain things which are very important and we have certain things which are not that important which may be superficial also.
So we can classify power into two sections regarding that certain powers are superficial powers or routine powers which are day-to-day business will be run on those.
And certain powers are substantial power.
So where the powers of substantial, the board of directors has to take collective decisions by board meetings and that would be a firm subsequently by the shareholders in the general body meeting.
But where powers are not that important those powers can be exercised either by one director in isolated capacity or by a committee of directors who have a delegation actually of those powers from board of directors.
So if we see what are the powers which a directors actually exercises in the corporate affairs.
We have to refer section 179 onwards and it goes from 179 to basically 185.
179 and 180 talks about those powers which can be exercised by the board of directors.
And those powers also which will be exercised board of directors plus the shareholders in the general body meeting.
So if we see the collective power they are mentioned in section 179 and they say general power general powers.
The general powers are all those powers which company can exercise and company can exercise borrowing powers as I told you company can exercise the contractual powers, company can exercise the proprietary powers and these powers basically are general powers.
But there is a further classification that the powers which are collective in nature meaning thereby that would be exercised by board and would be consented by the shareholders of the company.
They are many the first one is to make call.
The second is to authorize buy back.
Third to issue securities, IPO, debentures.
Third next to borrow moneys to invest in funds of the company inter corporate investment, to grants loans, to approve financial statement and boards reports, to diversify the business of the company, to approve amalgamation merger or reconstruction, to take over a company or acquire a controlling or substantial stake in another company or any other matter which is prescribed.
So if you see this power this power basically is exercisable by board of directors collectively but out of this certain power which is basically power to make call power, to authorize buyback power, to issue securities can also be delegated to the committee of directors by the board of directors.
Moving on we will now you see that what are those powers which run as a restrictions about the powers of the directors.
As we know the directors are having the general power as well as collective powers and there should be some check and balance regarding the abuse of the power.
That's why section 180 provides four specific categories where those will be running as a restrictions on the powers of the directors and these are especially attach with the diverging of the fonts diversion of the corporate funds, fussing of the accounts and illegally disposing of the properties of the company.
So if someone is trying to drain the company out of his assets then that can be held accountable under section 180 of the Companies Act.
It specifically provides to sell, lease or otherwise dispose of the value of the property to dispose of whole or substantially the whole of the undertaking of the company.
To invest interest securities amount of compensation received by it as a result of any merger and amalgamation, to borrow money, to remit or give time for the repayment of any death.
So these restrictions are limitations and the powers of the company.
Then there are certain other limitations and those limitations are mentioned in section 180 to 184 and 185.
Section 182 talks about political contribution and that is very controversial because the companies tries to influence the quality of a particular nation and thereby wants to have certain favorable decisions in their favor that's why the political contribution is limited that new companies cannot contribute to the political parties only old companies will contribute and those companies must be in the Corporate Affairs business for three financial years.
So they can contribute up to 7.5% of the net profits of the average of the three financial preceding years.
But a government company cannot contribute to any political party.
Then the next restriction on the power of the companies that the people who are interested in the material transactions they will not be allowed to be the party of those contractual agreement which the companies having with the third party meaning thereby that is also an outcome of a principle of administrative law that will know as the principal of biasness.
So if directors are having any personal interest they are biased in the transaction they should disclose it and if they disclose it they will not will let to take part in those transactions if they are taking part they will held accountable for the profit they are making in those transactions.
They are also criminally liable and then the next restriction is that they will not take any loan from the corporation because as I told you power to grant loan is a power which is actually initiated by the board and is confirmed by the shareholder but shareholders can easily be manipulated that there can be a firm in which the director is also a partner through that firm can fetch money from the a company where the director is employed.
That's why there is a restriction that if loan is granted to such a company that loan will be nullity in the eye of law but there is an exception that the management director and whole time director can be granted loan in recognition of their services.
So if we see that power have been granted but all these powers are running with limitations and this is the best in the interest of the shareholder as well as the other stakeholders of the company.
Now I will come to the duties of the director.
As we know the director stands in the fiduciary capacity to the company that's why he has duty to good faith duty of good faith, duty of reasonable care and duty not to delegate his powers.
These duties earlier were the common law duties which were made by these judgment laws.
Now they have been recognized well by the institute and they are mentioned in section 166.
They are moral or less same that if a director is there he will exercises his duty with due and reasonable care.
He will avoid conflict of interests.
He will not take any undue gain in any transaction that is being entered into by the company.
A director will also not assign his office he will not sale his public office and any assignment so made shall be void.
And if he breaching and office duty he shall punishable with fine which shall not be less than one lakh rupees but which may extend to five lakh rupees.
So we see now that those duties which have been identified by so many decisions in the common law countries they have been now recognized and made statutory duties in the New Companies Act.
Now if we try to find out that there are certain duties which are there in the institute mentioned particularly like as I told you the duty not to mislead the people by offer document section 34, 35, duty not to induce investors for buying shares, duty not to issue irredeemable preference shares, duty to file annual return, duty to hold statutory general meetings of the company, duty to maintain P&L account of the company, duty to ensure planning and execution of CSR that's very important feature in the new act.
That company has to contribute to the society also CSR feature section 135.
Then duty to get DIN as I told you Director Identification Number.
Then he has not to perform certain activities which I told you he will not make any political contribution.
He will not be interested director, he will also not give himself a loan by the company.
So if we see these are other duties which are mentioned that so many other places of the company.
So far so liability of the director is concerned because the director is in a fiduciary capacity of the company.
So if he breaches his liability then our duty then that results in liability also and he can be held accountable for ultra vires act.
He can be held accountable for negligence.
He can be held accountable for Mala Fide Acts.
He also owes liability to his co-fellows because if we see what is the liability aspect.
The liabilities is stands from one feature because he stands in fiduciary capacity to the company.
So if he is trying to do something beyond the powers of the company that stands as ultra vires.
As we know ultra vires doctrine is very old doctrine but even now this is a valid doctrine as was held in as very case that's a very landmark case in this regard.
Moving on the new companies act in order to ensure the fairness on the part of directors at various places hold him criminal liable, he can be made criminally liable for misstatement in prospectus, he can be made liable for criminally liable for issue of bonus shares, discounted shares, irredeemable preference shares, calling and falsification of share certificate.
He can also be made personally accountable criminally liable for filing not return, not filing return, for not holding AGM, for not distributing the dividends, for not getting the DIN number, for exceeding the maximum limit of inter-corporate directorship.
So these are the conditions where he can be made criminally liable.
Now coming to the last aspect of the directors as we know that directors powers are unlimited with regard to the corporate affairs to the company.
So they are to be exercised cautiously and mostly they are to be exercised by the board by the rule of majority.
And their depending upon the size of board, one third sell be the quorum where in the initial process of decision making will start because if a decision starts in a bad faith it will end up making the corporate bank corrupt are that may be a very region of termination of the existence of corporation.
So we see that there is a provision in section 173 which talks about what would be the structure and conduct and convening of the board meeting with says that a board has to meet within a year four times, first of all and within two meetings there will be a gap of 120 days.
And now the new act for the very first time applies and uses the electronic devices in electronic modes for holding meetings they are postal ballets and they are electronic mails.
So if we see this new structure of the company that gives a better access to the directors who can collectively decide that how the decisions in the best interest of the company shall be taken.
Lastly to conclude this module I would like to tell that directors are very important persons in the company and the directors are the like cabinet of the Lok Sabha.
So if they are on the most important pedestal of governor they have to be the best man who will be guarding the interest of all the stakeholders of the company.
Thank you.
Promoters, their positions, powers, duties and liabilities: While introducing this subject the promoters, I must deal with the basic aspects of the promotions of the company.
While promoting a company a person uses the company as a legal device for maximization of profit which is basically known as the business or trading activities.
So, promoters basically in a society are known as entrepreneurs who exercise in their fundamental right to do business; uses the corporate cover the corporate companies for maximization of profit.
The promotion is a very difficult task wherein the promoters while promoting the company travel through ranges of activities.
Therein, he incorporates the company, manages as the capital for the company, gives the necessary directions to the directors of the company.
In this module the learning outcome for you will be: who is a promoter, what is promotion, what are the duties of promoters, what are the liabilities of promoters, what is the remuneration of promoters and what is pre in cooperation agreement? Now, we should switch to the first issue that is the promoters and promotions.
As we know that promotion is a very technical and nontechnical task wherein the promoters are engaging certain associates are aids to help them out while promoting a company.
Promotion of company right from the joint stock companies act has been a very technical issue wherein the law recognize a certain individuals as an association of persons and then give them the corporate cover which they can exercise and use for maximization of profit.
This promotion has been up 3 types: Individual Promotion, Institutional Promotion and Professional Promotion.
In individual promotions the people who are very much jealous enthusiastic, they come together, they form a company and therein the company.
In the institutional promotions in order to pursue the objectives which are set by the people and the companies which are in public dealings.
So, there in the public companies can promote another company and third categories professional promotion where in the company is corporate or incorporate a company.
And those companies; the first business is incorporation Investments.
And mostly it is a west formula where the people give this assignment of promoting the company to the professional companies and we have certain companies, like: UBS, Merrill Lynch; who promote the company and the professional bases and for that there are fare charges.
Moving on, we will come to the stages of promotion what task a promoter is assigned to and how he moves on?So, this starts with the conception of idea because I told you that this is a modus operand die of doing business and because it's a device of doing business then if you plan it better that what kind of Corporate cover do you want, what kind of cooperation do you want for your particular type of services and goods?Then, half the task is all done.
So, its start with conception of idea, it moves to the next stage that is the most important states that is called incorporation and then next stage come, which is called flotation wherein the promoters manage the capital of the company and then the last stage comes which is called commencement of business.
Moving on, we will now try to define the term promoters.
I must make you clear that this last year in 2013 the New Company Act was passed by the Indian Parliament that is Companies Act, 2013.
In that for the first time we have tried to define the term promoters.
Otherwise, the term promoter was not defined in the old act and there was a proper definition that was given by house of lord in a judgment that is Whaley Bridge Company versus Green.
Wherein justice Bowell try to conclude the term by saying that promotion is an activity where there is a culminations are the confluence of two activities one is technical the other is non technical.
And in technical aspects he says arranging the knowhow, having a project planning, having a feasibility study; these are the technical aspects of promotions of the company.
And in non technical aspects of the company which is basically the incorporation of the company you have to have the required assemblies of the subscribers.
You have to get documented the documents of the company that is the memorandum and articles of the company and you may have to draft the prospectors if you are going for the initial public offer are the other types of private placement.
So essentially, if you see promotion; the promotion basically is founding a company so it's just like a father giving birth to a baby.
The next wonderful definition that we gets is the definition which is there in the security exchange in commission rule of US which is equally a very important definition to know wherein the rule defines the term promoter as a person who acting alone or in conjunction with other persons directly or indirectly takes the initiative in founding are organizing the business enterprise.
It also very much emphasizes the term founding are organizing the business enterprise.
So, doing anything for finding the company for maximization of profit leads to the conclusion that, that is the promoter.
Now, in the 2(69), 2 sub section 69 of the Indian companies act has define the term promoter because we have seen that the most of the companies now being used as a mode of scams or mode of what we call ‘ghotalas’ in Indian term.
So, in that there was a need there was a dire need to define the term promoters.
And because of that we have defined it in section 2 subsection 69 with basically is 3.
That any person whose name appears on the prospectors of the company are whose name appears in the annual return of the company is a promoter.
Then any person who controls the affairs of the company directly or indirectly then he is also a promoter of the company.
And last in accordance with whose device the directors are instructions of the board of directors of the companies custom to act and this does not include the professional people were engaged with the company, like: lawyer, the company secretary; they are not included.
So, if you see this definition the close analysis maybe that promoter is a person whose name appears in the official documents of the company and promoter is a person who has a full control over the affairs of the company.
Now, we will move to the activities which a promoters does while promoting the company.
So, if you see the activities of promoters it ranges from the so many activities, like: when he starts for having the idea of the company the most important things comes to the mind that he wants to do business by buying and selling and buying and selling goods and services.
So, he has to see what can be sold, first of all.
So, feasibility survey that what can be salable and what is in demand that is the first task that has to be done and then the second task is that how you can better sell that thing by which company because we know we have different types of companies.
Now, we have OPC One Person Company, we have a small company also, we have producers company, we have service company; we have so many companies.
So, depending upon what you want to sell is suitable type of corporate device can be picked and choosed.
So, that is the first thing which we know that conception of Idea and when you conceptualize an idea, conceive a baby that what kind of baby are what kind of company who want to have then the features and far those features you need to have so many things to be done in a while, like: you shall have to apply for so many numbers now, that is the CIN number (Corporate Identity Number) then GLN number (Global Location Number) TAN and PAN number as we know because they are subject to the tax realization.
Then, the next requirement is that you need to have the required number of subscribers because as we know that we need 2 or 7 subscribers for making public and private companies.
So, you have to have those required number of subscribers you have to have the numbers which are very much required by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs now.
And then, moving on you have to go for the next important aspect that is incorporation of company wherein you shall have to apply to the ROC with required documents and fees plus you have to have the documents of the company that is articles and memorandum.
They are the most important thing in the life of the company.
Then you have to have a very bulky document which is prospectus in the prospectus because by the prospectus you invite people to come and invest buy share in the company.
So, you have to have draft a prospectus also.
After that you have to have so many intermediaries: the Bankers, the Registrar the Depository Participant, the depositories the custodian and they will be involved in the process of share subscription which we know as flotation.
And therein the issuer, investors and intermediaries will arrange capital for the company.
And after that are within the process of that the promoters also will be doing so many waiting and compliance activities while drafting the prospectus are arranging the capital by way of IPO or private placement.
And in all these activities he is doing all such activities for the company which is non existence because as we know that company comes into an existence forth with after the getting certificate of incorporations.
So, so long the certificate of incorporation is not there, there is no birth of the company and for that for each thing that is to be done for founding and enterprise the promoter is responsible.
And for that he enters into an agreement that is known as pre incorporation active act.
And these pre incorporation agreement can be used by the promoters for getting everything the technical knowhow for the business, the employment for the workforce, getting a land for the business enterprise, getting a land for the headquarter of the business enterprise, getting a land for the manufacturing unit of the business enterprise, signing so many a number of agreements with the supplier, with the trader, with the warehouse keepers.
So, in all these you have to use the pre incorporation agreement.
Moving on, we will now try to find out what is the legal position of the promoters.
As we know that the Indian Companies Act, 2013 does not define the role actually are the promoters but promoters are in a very better positions in regard to the information and access to the material and confidential information about the information process of the company.
That's why sometimes they are known as agents and sometimes they are known as trustee.
But, in a very important case which was Erlanger versus New Sombrero Phosphate Company Limited, the Cairns Lord Justice defined that the promoters undoubtedly stand in a fiduciary capacity or fiduciary positions.
The term fiduciary has defined by different law lexicon means that where the people are having mutual trust and faith.
Duties of promoters: So, as I told you that, promoters have a fiduciary role to play in the company formation process and that specifically leaves two duties are that casts 2 duties on the promoters.
The first is: duty not to make secret profit, the second is: duty to disclose.
So, duty not to make secret profit, basically; is casted upon the promoters because the promotion may be a sentimental attachment or may be a matter of sentiment and promotion maybe also misused.
And we have seen so many cases where the corporate veil have been abused.
So, where the corporate veil is being abused by fraudulent people in order to wash off the properties are in order to dump their unproductive properties be tangible and intangible in the companies then they can make secret profit.
And where they are making secret profit without disclosing then they will be bound to return it bound to restore it with the company.
And I would like to share why this situation arises in the company formation process.
Because in company formation process, the promoters are in the positions who are knowing everything about formation.
And they also know what objective they want to achieve by making that company and this gives a very better understanding about the position, actual positions and the information regarding the pricing of the things.
And there they can make a attempt to dump their third rated products with the company on very high price.
And we have very fine example of cases like Gluckstein v Barnes where are the promoters tried to dump their products which was known as Olympia and tried to make 20,000 pound secret profit which was actually restored back to the company.
And then, there is a very fine case which I stated before also Erlanger versus New Sombrero Phosphate Company where the promoters tried to have make profit out of exhausted minds which actually coasted the 5,000 pound for 1 lakh 10 thousand pounds without disclosing to the company.
So, these examples these illustrations show how promoters having better access to the information and having a better position in the company regarding to the pre incorporation agreement can misuse their positions by making profit.
I must make it clear at this moment that making profit is not disallowed you can make profit, provided you disclose it to the company.
Then, the second duty out of the fiduciary capacity of the promoters that is duty to disclose interest in the transaction.
This duty again is based upon on the principle of natural justice that the persons who were dealing with the Corporate Affairs of the company they must be very much meticulous, very bonafide and they have to disclose everything about everything which they are knowing about any product.
So, if these duties are not performed by the promoters then the company can designed the contract and the company can also suit for recovery of profit.
But the companies shall have to prove that actually the promoter was in a position where he can have a better access and where he has actually misused his authority by not disclosing material fact to the company are by making a secret profit.
So, if he is making a secret profit then he shall have to restore it back.
And in order to check it out whether he has made any secret profit and the first AGM is dedicated just to investigate and examine why and what were the route of promotions and what kind of promotional activities have been initiated by the promoters while promoting the company and actually the promoters made any profit or not.
So, by these illustrations we can see that promoters are under a moral obligations to promote the company in the best effort or in the best suitable manner.
Moving on, we will be now dealing with a very small aspect of the duties that when this duty starts and when this duty terminates.
So, the duties start with the conception of idea.
The moment the people the entrepreneurs who want to do business by way of corporations for maximization of profit conceived the idea that we have to do business by the corporation this duty starts immediately.
And the duty basically does not terminate in a sense because so long the company will be running the promoters will like to have a better grip over the company because this is their baby and when they have promoted the companies they will like to have their control over the affairs of the company.
That's why they use the controlling shares which we now have EDVR(Equity With Differential Voting Rights)where they will have lesser amount of equity but that would give them a better control in the Corporate Affairs of the company.
So, actually speaking their duty never dies; their duty continuous.
But so far so duty regarding the promoters liability is concerned then the promoters duty terminates at the moment when the first directors are appointed and if no directors are appointed the same promoter become the deemed director of the company.
That's why if directors are appointed their duty terminates, if directors has not appointed their duty continues but in a different role as a director of the company.
Liabilities of the Promoters: As I told you that this year we have made this act very comprehensive where we have tried to pluck the loopholes which were earlier there in the old act.
That's why we find at so many place, mentioned the liabilities of promoters and those liabilities are civil as well as criminal.
And these are result of the recent scams that took place in the Corporate Affairs as we know these were Satyam, Enron like scandal.
And because of that we made the provisions of the Companies Act more comprehensive, more covering and more reaching in terms of un stipules promotions.
And we have two terms in the Companies Act which is very much pivotal that is ‘officer’ who is the officer of the company and ‘officer in default’.
And the officer in default is punished for every type of wrong decisions that is been taken for every type of wrong compliance of the corporate laws which is there in the Companies Act.
So, we know see that the term officer and officer in default is very comprehensive enough to cover the promoters.
So, if we see the liabilities of the promoters it is thought as I told you from the conception of the ideas to the incorporation then the flotation then it goes for the commencement of business and lastly if the companies is promoters continues to control their power or want to have a controlling power over the company it continues till the death of the company that is the winding up of the company.
Now, the Companies Act is a very pivotal in regard to making of the company, so if someone is furnishing wrong information thereby getting the company incorporated that is punishable in section 7 of the new act.
And there is liability of the promoters as an officer in default for making in misstatement in the prospectus and these liabilities civil well as criminal and promoters are also liable for inducing people for buying shares in a corporation.
And then promoters are equally liable for making periodic disclosures which are meant for bringing transparency and accountability of the corporations and they are the annual letter and the annual financial statement which is very important to be filed under section 92 of this act.
As I told you that the company is required to appoint First Director.
Usually, they are appointed by the articles of the company but if company fails to appoint them then the same promoters will become deemed directors.
So, here also the role changes but the liability doesn't, they will be liable in a different role.
Then, the promoters also play very pivotal role in the corporate combination process that is merger and acquisition and amalgamations and therein they can award the hostile takeover either buyback system or by some other system.
So, in a corporate combination process they also play a very controlling role because they have controlling shares in the company and those controlling shares can be offloaded or on loaded depending upon the situation they are in if they want to have it they can offload it, they do not want to have it they can buy more securities from the market that is buyback.
Moving on, the liability is also continued when they are in the process of winding up as we know that winding up of the company is termination of the death and therein if there is winding of continuous the promoters are not dispensed with the liabilities that is there.
They will be unreliable to corporate fully with the company liquidator; with the company bench if that is there which is monitoring the winding up process.
And now we have very comprehensive criminal as well as civil liabilities of the promoters if enduring winding up process there are misusing their authority and they are promoting the fraudulent activities then they shall be liable under section 336 to 342 of the New Companies Act.
As well as they will be also liable from section 447 to 453 of the act wherein they are made liable in a very comprehensive manner for all such fraudulent activities which turns out to be fraudulent after the winding up of the company.
And there is one very specific provision section 450 which is very comprehensive and which is of residuary nature.
You can further refer the Bare Act of the Companies Act for your inclusive growth.
I will now concentrate about the very important aspect of the promotion that is the prospectus.
As we know that the prospectus is offer document by which you make people aware that this is the company and there you can invest.
And in the prospective you see that company provides 3 basic information: One is the general information of the company; what the company is, what the company is doing, what the company is going to do?Then, there is financial information of the company: basically, it is a balance sheet or PLN account of the last three preceding financial years and then the issue information that what kind of IPU you want to bring an initial public offer and by that what is your target to achieve? What is your subscribed capital, what is your paid up capital what would be your paid up capital and by that paid up capital how you are going to realise your objectives?So, in the issue part you have to provide so many things, like: you have to provide the base price, you provide for the book building process, you have to provide for the QIBs, who will be the QIBs, who will be the institutional investors, will be the retail investors and who is your stock exchange, whether you are listed on are not listed so many things you have to provide.
But the basic important feature of the IPO of process is prospectus.
As we know that drafting a prospectus is very technical task that is assigned to the company and that is more than 500 pages document which is running so wherein you have to provide everything the general information, financial information and issue information so you take help from outside and the help is provided by the SEBI Security Exchange Board of India.
Because SEBI is the regulator of the capital market primary and secondary.
So, SEBI will be helping you out and therein first; we have to draft a prospectus and file with the SEBI.
After drafting the prospectus the SEBI will do the red pencil exercise that is known as Red Hearing Prospectus and finally there will be final publication of a draft after the final publication of the draught people will buy the shares of the company.
So, we see that the role of prospectus is very important in the share subscription because it helps the prospective investors of the company to make up a decision, rational decision, whether they should invest in a company or not and weather by disclosures made in the prospectus, the companies appear to be a company which is actually going to achieve certain objectives which are moral also not only the legal.
Because legally speaking the companies meant for maximization of profit but maximization of profit cannot be an objective of any society.
It is also associated with all other objects; like: text, like: employment, like: supply of necessities so one has to be closely seeing all these aspects also.
He can't ignore it.
Moving on, I am dealing with the prospectus; prospectus is very important and as I told you that for drafting a prospectus which is at meticulous, you may have to have civil and criminal liabilityAnd for that I would like to quote a case which can make you better understand the prospectus and miss statement the prospectus that is a very old case, William Derry versus Henery Peek, Derry versus peek we know it often.
And this case is about how miss statement in the prospectus is a very material one.
And in this case there was a company British Tramways Companies.
British Tramways Company applied for a license with the board of trade and this license was pending but the directors assuming that they in all probably cases will g et the license they made a disclosure in the prospectus that they have got the license from the Board of Trade and they will now run the British Tramways company instead of Horse Power with the Steam Power.
But actually, the situation was the day license application was pending with the Board of Trade.
So, actually they did not receive.
So, the information that was with them was not true but they believed to be true and they made it and uncertain grounds the House of Lord held it that this is a case of misrepresentation not fraud.
That's why the directors were not held accountable but this case is a very fine example upon which we drafted our Companies Act.
And therein we provided for civil as well as criminal liability of the promoters in case there is any misleading or miss statement in the prospectus.
So, in this regard I would like to say that while drafting the prospectus we observed the Golden Rule Formula and Golden Rule Formula is make 100% disclosure about the facts which are within the information of the promoters so as to make know the prospective investors of the company the best about the company.
Moving on, as we know that I was telling you that there are provisions in the Companies Act, New Companies Act in section 34 and 35 which is civil and criminal liability regarding the miss statement of prospectus but there are general and special defenses also available to the people who are associated with the prospectus.
If they have with due their consent they will not be held accountable.
If they are working in professional capacity they will not be held accountable.
If something is creeping in the prospectus without their information they will not be held accountable.
So, this is about the special aspect of liability with regard to the prospectus especially.
Pre-incorporation Agreement: The term Pre-Incorporation agreement as I suggested you is very important because these are the soul and heart of the company formation process.
As I told you that here the corporation that is contemplation in the eye of law that is a legal device that is the legal person is speaking so that is a corporation aggregate also.
So, in this corporation aggregate we find that certain individuals are given a corporate cover and they are held as a different individual are different personality that is a corporate personality and corporate personality is altogether different from the other members who are actually the subscribers on the company.
So, the actual position is that they are doing the thing for a company which is going to come in future.
So, whatever acts they are doing now that will be validated only when the company gets incorporated.
Meaning thereby whatever agreements they have to sign in order to mobilize resources for formation of the company that has to be done in some representative character wherein they are disclosing that whatever would material, whatever resources they are getting that would be utilised for the formation of the company.
Meaning thereby whatever agreement they are signed that should be signed an account of or on behalf of a company which is going to come in future.
So, this agreement which basically is very pivotal in company formation process is known as Pre-Incorporation Agreement but the legal issue with the Pre-Incorporation Agreement is that those agreements are signed by the company which is not in existence.
And those agreements will be nullity in the eye of law as explained in a case Kelner vs Baxter and that Kelner vs. Baxter case is a fine example about the crucial issue that was involved in the Pre-Incorporation agreement.
Wherein two people Kelner and Baxter, they incorporated company promoted a company Gravesend Royal Alexandra Hotel company and therein they one person one party tried to sell the wine to the other party.
The price was 900 pound and this was done by a sale agreement which was signed on January 27 1866 within company was not incorporated.
The directors, they would be directors of the company ratified the agreement on February first, 1866 even now the companies not incorporated.
Then, it was finally, the company finally received the certificate of incorporation on 20th February and subsequently also director signed a ratification agreement on 11th April.
So, we see that there is a sale happening of wine which will be used for business by the company which is going to come and sale the agreement is actually taking place much before the date of incorporation.
And date of incorporation is very important in this regard because after that only the legal existence of the company will come.
So, in the case the court held that until the companies incorporated it cannot contract and because it cannot contract then the effect of contract will be in nullity because the company was not there being an honest.
There was no existence of the company that’s why Pre-Incorporation Agreement will not be valid and all those things which are being mobilized the liability for that will be held.
A liability for that will be borne by the promoters.
So, because of this technical issue regarding the Pre-Incorporation Agreement there was a kind of repelling factor which stops the promoters promoting a company because they may be in a situation that company may with all those agreement subsequently to the incorporation process because as I told you in the first AGM the promoters are made accountable that whatever pre incorporation agreement they have signed that would be checked and verified.
That's why the Jenkins Committee in 1962 in England recommended for that we should have a provision for the protection of the promoters and therein by the recommendations of Jenkins committee.
There was an amendment made in the English Companies Act, 1985 under section 36 wherein the promoters were given a relief and the relief was that if the Pre-Incorporation Agreement is warranted by the terms of incorporations.
Then, the company cannot repudiate its liability the company cannot reject all those agreements and then in the line of that we are also a common law country we also had an amendment in our act and the amendment was made in the Indian Specific Relief Act, 1963 in the provision 15(h) and 19(e).
In both situations if there are Pre-Incorporation Agreements then in pre corporation agreements they can be made in foreseeable by company or against company if the activity which is the part or subject matter of the pre-incorporation active event is warranted by the terms of incorporation.
Warranted by the terms of incorporation is a very wide term that basically means that whatever thing, whatever services, whatever activities has been done in the name of Pre-Incorporation Agreement that is within the term of incorporation or not depends upon the situations.
Like, as I told you that if a company is being formed then promoters may have so many other opportunities but if those opportunities are being availed by the promoters for their vested interest then the company can obviously avoid it, holding it ultra vires; meaning thereby that was not warranted by the terms of incorporations.
Like, having a holiday while promoting a company when he is going to sign a technical, a technology transferred agreement with some other country can be a situation which will be not warranted by the terms of incorporations.
So these are the situations regarding the pre-incorporation agreement.
Remuneration of Promoter: As we know that Promoter stands in a fiduciary capacity where he is believed to have mutual trust and obligations and moral obligations for promoting the company.
So, naturally the promoters and not given any kind of remuneration for promoting a company.
And I told you that promoters basically give birth to a company and father does not charge anything from this baby that is the basic code that we have from the Robert R. Pennington’s book.
But we see that because the promotion is a very technical task it involves so many activities to be done that's why the promoters are required to be paid something which have some monetary value in eye of law.
So, promoters can be paid by fully paid up shares as was done in ‘Solomon Case’.
Promotion can also be given commission on shares sold.
Promoters can also be paid a lump-sum amount also and the articles of the company may also provide for the promotional remunerations.
Apart from that after the incorporation process there can be a separate covenant or there can be a separate agreement with the promoters for the payment of the remuneration.
So, while remunerating the promoters the company should also be mindful that promotion is not a very simple task and if the promoters are in anticipation or in apprehension the day shall be paid for their promotion.
They will not be ending up doing scams, they will not be ending up making secret profit they, will not be concealing very material information from the company.
So, remunerating the company is a very important thing while formation of the company.
And in this regard, I would like to say that if the company he is being sold property which actually of the promoter.
Then, the company can in lieu up that assign him the fully paid up shares which is the best mode of payment or boast made of remunerating the promoter.
Moving on, as we have seen that in the promotion activities that the promoters are very important persons in the Corporate Affairs of the company so they have a very better control over the management of the company and they keep this control throughout the life of the company and the promoters are also the persons who actually sink and swim with the corporate life.
I would like to close the module which I was talking with you on the promotions and I would like to say that promotion is very important activities wherein a promoter is involved in making a business enterprise which shall be used for maximization of profit.
Hello everyone, welcome to MOOCs program on Corporate Law.
I am Anant Vijay Marya.
I practice in Delhi High Court.
I hope you are reading other modules on corporate and learning as well as reading extensively on Corporate Law.
Today, I will be presenting on Foreign direct in a foreign direct investment in Indian companies.
The learning objectives of which should be, first the concept of foreign direct investment in Indian companies.
Second, Investment, how is it regulated in India.
Third, different Institutions involved in the process.
Fourth, kind of routes available prohibited and permitted.
Fifth, would be what are the investment criteria for different entities when it comes to foreign direct investment in India.
The overview of the module will be that students will be able to understand the concept of Foreign Direct Investment in India.
They will understand the nuances of such investments methods and types.
They will also learn prohibited and permitted sectors as well as different criteria for different entities.
The policy of the government behind the investment will also be brought to knowledge for the purpose in this case.
The student will also learn about the Foreign Exchange Management Act.
In the light of the liberalisation policies introduced in 1991, the government at that point of time wanted to infuse a lot of foreign capital into the economy in order to promote the dying sectors of the economy.
So, what it wanted to do was open up the economy, liberalise economy and try to globalise the economy.
How to liberalize and globalize the economy by infusion of Foreign Direct Investment.
There existed an act called as Foreign Exchange Regulation Act and which was the regulating act on the foreign exchange in India.
So, during the process of economic liberalization related to foreign investment and foreign trade the government realised that FERA needs to be amended and to be brought in light with the present practices that the government wanted to introduce.
Also that it was felt that the time for FERA has you know ended and the new act should be introduced in order to incorporate the new world.
So, taking into consideration such development and a substantial increase in foreign exchange reserves, growth in foreign trade, rationalisation of tariffs, current account convertibility, the foreign exchange management bill to repeal the foreign exchange Regulation Act was introduced in Lok Sabha.
But unfortunately, at that point of time the Lok Sabha dissolved and the bill could not be passed.
So, the foreign exchange management act then was later introduced in Lok Sabha.
The president give assent on 9 December, 1999 and was brought into force from 1 June 2000.
Now, the foreign companies invest in India to take advantage of relatively low wages, special investment privileges such as tax exemption etc.
For a country where for investors invest, it means that they are giving technical know how to the country and as well as their generating employment.
Now, they are becomes important elements as to when we understand foreign exchange and foreign investment.
There are two transactions that we really need to learn.
The current account transaction as well as a capital account transaction.
The current account transaction is under Section 5 of the FEMA where it says that any person to sell or drop foreign exchange to or from authorized person is such sale of withdrawal is the current account transaction as defined under section 2J of the act.
However, the central government may in public interest and consultation with the Reserve Bank impose reasonable restrictions for current accounts transaction.
So, what are the some examples that we can stipulate is for opening of letter of credit, use of international credit card, International debit card or ATM card or any other thing where the effect of creating for an exchange liability happens.
Now, the second concept is Capital Account Transaction.
Capital Account Transaction is mentioned under section 6 of the FEMA or the Foreign Exchange Management Act whereby it allows for exchange or for creation of foreign foreign currency where by the Reserve Bank of India is to specify consultation with the central government any class or classes of Capital Account Transaction permissible and the limit up to which foreign exchange shall be admissible for such transaction.
However, Reserve Bank shall not impose any restriction on the drawl of foreign money.
In Brownfield Investment relating to existing investments or business activities.
Following are the various type and kinds of Brownfield Investment.
First, share purchase.
Second, conversion of ECB, reincorporation payables royalty.
Third,  bonus share or EOP.
Fourth, Demerger and Amalgamation.
Fifth, gift of shares.
Sixth, share swap.
So, why we were discussing what is Foreign Exchange Management Act? Now, it also becomes very imperative on us to understand what are the various authorities that control Foreign Exchange Management Act? For the purpose of this act there are two authorities that control the foreign exchange in India.
First is the central government second is the RBI.
Further bifurcation can be made under central government in the form of Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion that is DIPP and second will be Foreign Investment Promotion Board FIPB.
And under RBI, there is a Foreign Exchange Department which regulates the entire gamut of what the RBI role should be.
Now let us come the what are the various criterias for FDI in India where resident entities.
First we will discuss FDI in Indian company.
Indian companies including and not limiting to medium, small and manufacturing enterprises in issue capital against FDI.
FDI in partnership firm or proprietary concern.
Second, in this there are several criterias or guidelines in order for us to analyse.
The first would be a non-resident Indian or a person of Indian origin that is NRI or PIO can invest by way of involvement in capital of a firm or a proprietary concern in India on non-repatriation basis.
However, certain fact is need to be kept in mind which are, first, either through inward remittances or any out of NRE, FCNR or NRO accounts kept with authorised dealers and authorised banks.

Third would be investment by non-residents other than NRIs and PIO.
Any other person except NRIs/ PIO who is a resident outside India can make an application before RBI for the purpose of investing by way of contribution to the capital of firm or proprietorship.
The application will obviously be decided in consultation with the government of India.
Now, comes the fourth point that are restrains.
All options comes with NRIs or PIOs for the purpose of investment in a firm or proprietorship except real estate, print media, immovable property and agricultural and plantation business that exist in India.
Now, let us understand the Foreign Currency Account.
In Indian companies which are eligible to issue shares to persons resident outside India under the FDI policy may be allowed to retain the share separation about in foreign currency account with prior approval of RBI.
Now, how to transfer of shares and convertible debentures? First, subject to FDI sectoral policy.
Foreign investors can invest in Indian companies by purchasing or acquiring existing shares from Indian shareholders or from other non-resident share holders.
General permission is required for be granted to non-resident as well as PIO for acquisition of shares by way of transfer subject the following criterias.

Fifth, a person resident in India can transfer by way of sale, share convertible debentures of an Indian company under private arrangement to person resident outside India subject to specified guidelines.
Sixth would be that general permission is also available for transfer of share convertible debentures by way of sale under private arrangement by a person outside India to a person resident in India subject to specified guidelines.

Seventh point would the firm FC, TRS should be submitted to the AD category one bank within 60 days from the date of receipt of the amount of consideration.
The owners of submission of the firm within the given time frame will be on the transferor or transferee resident in India.
Now, second under this will be the sale consideration in respect of equity instruments by person resident outside India remitted into India through general banking channels shall be subjected to a KYC or Know Your Customer norms check by remittance receiving AD category.
One bank at the time of receiving of funds.
In case the remittance receiving AD category one is different from the AD category Bank handling the transfer transaction.

Third, escrow account.
AD category one banks have been given general permission to open escrow account and special account of non- resident corporate for open offers or existing offers and delisting of shares.
The relevant SEBI regulation or any other applicable SEBI regulation shall apply here.
Prior permission of RBI in certain cases for transfer of capital instruments.
The following instances of transfer of capital instrument from resident to non-resident by way of sale require prior approval of RBI.
First, transfer of capital instruments from resident to non-resident by way of sale where the transfer is at a price which was falls outside the pricing guidelines specified by the Reserve Bank from time to time at the transaction does not fall under the specific guidelines of as specific exception.
Clause B would be transfer of capital instrument by the non-resident aquaria involving deferment of payment of the amount consideration.
Further, in case approval is granted for a transaction the same should be reported in form FC TRS to an authorised dealer category one bank for necessary due diligence within 60 days and from the date of receipt of full and final amount of the consideration.
Second would be a person resident in India who intense to transfer any capital instrument by way of gift to a person resident outside India has as to approach RBI for prior approval and while forwarding the application to RBI for approval for the transfer of capital instrument by way of gift, the specified document should be enclosed.
So that RBI can process it and as well as then look into the matter.
So, the Reserve Bank of India considers the following factors file processing such application.
The first would be (A) The proposed transferee is eligible to hold capital instruments under scheduled 1,4 and 5 of notification number F.E.M.A 20 of 2000-RB dated may 3rd 2000, as amended from time to time.

Such other conditions as stipulated by Reserve Bank in Public Interest from time to time.
Now, what are when we study the foreign exchange we also need to study the foreign the conversion of external commercial borrowings or the lump sum fee or the royalty into equity.
Conversion of ECBs or royalty into equity.
Following factors need to be considered while conversion of the external commercial borrowing takes place.
Which are that Indian companies have been granted general permission for conversion of external conversion borrowing in inconvertible foreign currency into shares and preference shares subject to the following condition and requirements.
First would be the activity of the company is covered under the automatic route for the FDI other company has obtained government approval for foreign equity.
Second, the foreign equity after conversion of ECB into equity is within the sectoral limit.
Third, pricing of shares is as per FDI policy.
Fourth, complainance with the essential as prescribed under any other law statued, en force.
Fifth would be, the conversion facility available for such ECBs which can be availed under both the routes and is applicable to ECBs due for payment or not.
As well as secured or unsecured loan available for non-resident collaborators.
Now, let us also understand several instruments that are available with us when it comes to issue to the foreign investors.
First, would be issue of write or bonus shares.
The right of bonus share is covered under FEMA as it allows Indian companines to freely issue it to the existing non-resident share holders subject to observance of sectoral cap as well as the as such as companies act or this SEBI ICDR guidelines 2,000.
The price priority needs to be maintained at all levels so that there exists no problem with approval.
Second, prior permission of RBI for right issue to erstwhile OCBs.
Automatic existence or entertainment of right has been discontinued post September 16, 2003.
Therefore, companies which desired to issue such write to erstwhile OCBs will have to take permission from RBI now.
Now, third will be acquisition of shares under scheme of merger, demerger or amalgamation.
Merger, Demerger and amalgamation of companies in India are administered by an order issued by the court.
Whereby a scheme is presented before the court and the scene is approved by the court in order that a merger of the transferee company of the new company is allowed to issue shares to the shareholders of the transferor company resident outside India, subject to two conditions.
First is, the percentage of share holding patterns of person resident outside India in the new company does not exceed the sectoral cap.
Second would be the new companies not engaged in any activities as prohibited under the FDI policy.
Now, the next category of instrument would be issue of shares under the employee stock option Schemes or commonly known as ESOPs schemes.
ESOP schemes the listed companies are permitted to issue shares under the ESOP schemes to its employee or employees of a joint venture or wholly owned subsidiaries abroad who are resident outside India other than to the citizens of Pakistan and of Bangladesh.
ESOPs can be issued with the prior approval of foreign investment promotion board or FIBB.
And shares can under ESOPs be also issue directly through a trust or fulfillment of the condition such as (A) Compliance of relevant regulation.
Second, the face value of the share the allotted under the scheme should not exceed 5% of the total paid up capital.
Third would be that a mandatory notice of 30 days needs to be given.

And sixth is Gambling and Betting including casino and also area such as the the not open to Private Sector Investment.

Modes of entry in India.
So, the first one we were discussing was Wholly Owned Subsidiaries.
The wholly owned subsidiary arises when the parent company owns the subsidiaries entire shares that is the 100% shares.
Since the parent company owns all of the subsidiary shares, it has the right to appoint the Subsidiaries Board of Director which controls the subsidiary.
Wholly Owned Subsidiaries may be part of the same industry as well as of an entirely different industry.
A person operating in more than any one country may choose to operate a business to a Wholly Owned Subsidiaries.
They investment is subject to compliant of FDI policy.
Second will be subsidiary.
A foreign company can open a subsidiary company in India that can be done either by accruing the majority of the shares, that is more than 50% of the company or where controlling the composition of Board of Directors of the company.
Both holding and subsidiary companies, a separate legal entities and their related to each other by virtue of subsidiary and holding company relationship.
They are also subject to FDI policy.
Third is the joint venture.
A foreign company can enter into India by forming a strategic alliance with an Indian partner.
In general practice, it is defined as a business agreement in which the parties agree to develop for a finite time a new entity and a new asset in which they both are equally contributing equity.
The ratio of foreign party in shareholding can be anywhere between 0 to 50%.
By mutual agreement, they may exercise control over the enterprise and consequently share revenues, expenses, asset and liabilities may be divided.
It can be incorporated either as private limited company or a public limited company which has to be registered under the Companies Act, 2013.
And subject to exchange control regulation and foreign direct policy of the Government of India.
The investments are subject to the complaints of FDI policy.
Now, when we came to the definition of place of business under the Companies Act with the permission of RBI, there are three methods by which we can say what are the places of the business.
The first will be branch office.
Second will be the liaison or the representative office.
And the third can be project office.
The first that is branch office can be essentially anywhere, where the related activity is carried out by its head office and the purpose of such offices is essentially is expansion of business and to diverse location.
Thus, help in increasing the customer base.
Second will be the liaison or the representative office.
Foreign companies can also a setup a liaison or representative office whereby the role is only subject to collecting of information about market opportunities and providing production information about the parent company to future customers.
Third, as I discussed is project office which it means a place of business to represent the interest of the foreign company executing a project in India but does not include a liaison office.
Foreign companies can be set up temporary project and site offices for executing the specific projects.
The RBI has granted permission to a foreign entity for setting up project office in India.
Now, other important material changes that are brought under the Companies Act, 2013 when it comes to foreign investment in Indian companies.
The first would be foreign companies can now establish either a private or public limited company in India without any mandatory limitation under section 47 of the Companies Act, 1956.
Mandatory requirement of minimum one resident director who has to stay beyond a period of 180 days also has been reduced.
The new addition of video conferencing keeping in mind the recent developments that have been taking place is allowed subject to that a directory must attend a meeting within a period of 12 months.
The director responsibility statement in board shall disclose that their device proper system to ensure due compliance with the provisions of all applicable laws under the act.
The cross border merger has been allowed as per the provisions of Companies Act, 2013 subject to certain condition.
Also, the new companies act introduced the policy of class actions suit whereby the class action as constituted can be can bring a suit before the company law tribunal for the purpose of adjudication.
The dormant company concept has also been introduced in India.
Now, let us discuss this new amendments that have been brought by the FDI policy, 2015 as well as the FDI policy 2016.
The FDI policy has brought the following changes.
First, Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs in order for it to consider a proposal the pecuniary limit has been increased.
Second, prior approval in respect for any transfer of shares and mergers can be done away with the mandatory filing of FC-TRS for the transaction on stock exchanges.
Fourth will be prior approval is required if any additional foreign investment is required to be done.
The changes that have been brought by FDI policy 2016 is in light of doing ease of business in India.
There have been several changes that has been introduced in order to open the new sectors which were closed before and also to increase the existing sectoral caps where they were in limitation.
The government has taken steps in order to open and expand new sectors for the purpose under the FDI policy 2016.
I will now list out several important points under the new FDI policy 2016.
First is, 49% FDI under automatic route is permitted now in insurance and pension sectors.
The second is foreign investment upto 49% in defence sector is permitted under automatic route.
Third will be the FDI limit for defence sector mid applicable to manufacturing of small arms and ammunition covered under manufacturing arms, 1959.
The FDI, up to 100% under automatic route is permitted in teleport direct to home cable networks mobile TV head headed in the sky broadcasting services also.
100% FDI under automatic route is also available for the Brown Field airport projects.
Next, FDI limit for Scheduled Air Transport Service, Domestic Schedule Passenger Airline and Regional Air Transport Service is raised to 100% with FDI upto 49% permitted under automatic route and FDI beyond 49% through government approval.
Foreign airlines would continue to be allowed to invest in capital of Indian companies operating scheduled and non scheduled air transport services up to the limit of 49% of the paid up capital.
Next, in order to provide clarity to the e-commerce sector, the government has issued guidelines for foreign investment in the sector.
100% FDI under automatic route is permitted under the market model place of e-commerce.
100% FDI is also a proof of retail trading as well as through e- commerce and other such activities.
Also for all those who look into financial institution, 100% FDI is also allowed in ARC or also called as asset reconstruction companies under the automatic route.
Now, coming to certain market statistics that will make us understand the government figures and facts regarding how FDI is being increase in 2015 and 2016.
We have already taken China.
When it comes to foreign direct investment in India.
In 2015 India has the most amount of foreign investors when it comes to the global economy.
Certain as a fact was that the according to DIPP that is Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion, the total FDI in India in 2015-16 period was US dollar 40 billion which indicates that the government effort to increase the ease of doing business is totally working.
Since, the foreign investors are now encourage to invest in India further on.
The second will be that the highest FDI equity flow of US 6.9 billion dollars was also followed by the computer hardware sector and the software sector in India.
Third would be, India received the maximum FDI equity flows from Singapore and by Mauritius.
Then followed by USA and Netherlands and Japan .
So clearly, the Prime Minister's effort to increase the ease of doing business and to increase the inflow of foreign exchange in India is clearly working.
The next will be India witness 29% of increase in foreign foreign direct investment in India which reached to 40 billion dollars during April, 2015 and March, 2016 as compared to 30 million dollars last year.
The next is, the budget 2016 has proposed several reforms in FDI policies in areas of insurance and pension, asset reconstruction company, stock exchanges and for easier fund raising norm in order that clarification of tax has also been issued by the government so that there is more ease of doing business and the FDI can come easily.
Next is that in order to make India more attractive foreign investment destination.
The Finance Minister this year has also included something called as the resident permit policy whereby he is allowing the people to stay and to invest a further of USA 2 billion dollar to upscale the amount of inflow in the housing as well as the residency permit.
The Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP) has allowed 100 % FDI in Asset Reconstruction Company from this year on worth under the automatic route.
The next would be the government has relaxed FDI policy in 15 Sectors and as well as increase the sectoral caps in so many sectors benefiting so many people in employment know how facilities and as well as the technical know how.
The government also relax the FDI policy norms non-resident Indians.
Under this, the non repritable investment made by the PIOs, overseas citizens of India and NRIs will be treated as domestic investment and will not be treated as FDI caps.
India cabinet also cleared a proposal which allows 100% FDI in railway infrastructure excluding operation.
Though the initiative does not allow foreign firms to operate trains, it allows them to invest in areas such as creating the network and supplying trains for Bullet Trains.
India is also likely to grant most favored Nation to 15 member Nation that rather in talk regarding the agreement on RCEP that is Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership and would allows significant easing of investment rules for these countries.
In conclusion, FDI after 1991 has constantly increased and several factors and several areas have open and will keep on opening.
FDI is very important for any country to broom and prosper as we have seen in the case of China.
Friends ,I really wish you luck for the self assessment and examination.
All the best!
What exactly do mean with by business? Business and organisation or enterprise which is engaged in commercial industrial or professional activities.
A business can be for a profit entity.
Such as publicly treated corporations or for non profit organisations engaged in business activities such as agricultural cooperative.
L.R.DICKSON has defined business as a form of activity pursued primary with the object of earning profit for the benefit of those on whose behalf the activity is conducted.
Business involves production or exchange of goods and services to on profit or in a border sense to earn a living.
Profit is not the sole objective of the business.
It may have other objective like promotion of welfare of the workers and the general public.
Now, will discuss about the nature of business.
A business enterprise has the following characteristics.
First dealing in goods and services.
The first basic characteristics of a business is that it deals in goods and services.
Goods produced or exchange maybe consumer goods.
Such as bread, rice clothes etc. or capital goods such as machines, tools etc.
The second nature of business is production and exchange.
Every business is concerned with production and exchange of goods and services for value.
Thus, goods produced or purchased for personal consumption of presenting to others as gifts do not constitute business because there is no sale or transfer for value involved.
Third is regularity and continuity in dealings.
1 single cell transaction cannot strictly constitute a business.
A sale of a product can be called a business if it undertaken frequently.
Fourth is uncertainty or risk.
It is true that the element of risk is present in almost all economic activities.
But it is undoubtedly more significantly present in business activities.
Last is profit motive.
First production function.
What do we mean by production function ? Under this function, a business organisation transform its inputs like manpower, material, machinery ,capital, information ,energy into a particular output as demanded by the society.
The second function of business is marketing function.
This is concerned with the distribution of goods and services produced by the production department.
As we all know that in order to make a business successful how important is marketing.
The marketing department guides the production department in product planning, development in price of various products produced by the business is an it also promotes the sale of goods through advertisements and sales promotion.
Third is finance function.
Money is an important factor in any business.
Thus arrangements of sufficient capital for the smooth running of the business is an important function for a business organisation.
To undertake many important decisions such a source of finance, investment of funds in the productive ventures in levels of inventory for various items are undertaken under this finance function.
will discuss about the different forms of business organisation.
The first form of business organisation is sole proprietorship.
Business which runs under the exclusive ownership and control of an individual is called the sole proprietorship or single entrepreneurship.
Under this form and individual may run the business alone with the help of his own skill and intelligence or may employ a few employees for helping him in conducting the business.
It is the simplest and the oldest form of business organisation .
some of the features of sole proprietorship.
First, this is owned by 1 man who contributes capital for conducting business.
Secondly, he has absolute control over the affairs of the business.
Third, the liability of the sole proprietor is unlimited as he earns all profit.
Fourthly, a sole proprietary concern is free from government regulations.
No formalities are to be observed in its formation management or in its closure.
It is not a separate entity.
Consequently, the business comes to an end with the permanent disability that or insolvency of the proprietor .
some of the merits of sole proprietorship.
First, no legal formalities are required to complied with in order to start a sole proprietary business.
It is one of the most easy form of business organisation to start with and it is easy to form as well as to dissolve.
Second business secrecy is maintained .
And to face the challenge of the competition in the market maintenance of business secrecy provides an edge to the form over its rival firms.
Thirdly, sole proprietorship offers the scope for flexibility in business operations by alloing the business to adapt.
And it was itself to the changing times and situations.
Fourthly, as the size of a sole proprietorship business is small and the owner maintains a personal touch with the employes and customers, it brings inefficiency and motivation.
Then the government interference in the business activities.
And this form of business organisation is leased and the day to day running of the business.
Also there is no interference by the government.
some of the demerits of the sole proprietorship.
First ,large units which require enormous capital cannot be started find individual as he can contribute only a limited amount of capital in the business.
Secondly, as the liability of the sole trader being unlimited, even his private assets are in danger of being lost .
And in order to meet liabilities office business, there is an uncertainty of continuity.
Lastly, it's very difficult to lock maximum advantage under this form of business organisation.
As the financial resources are very limited.
The second form of business organisation is Hindu Undivided Family.
The joint Hindu family is a form of business organisation in which the family possesses a property, inherited property and the 'kartha' the head of the family manages its affairs.
It comes into existence by the operation of Hindu law and not out of contract between the members of coparceners As a result the joint Hindu family business is a business by a coparceners of a Hindu undivided estate.
Some of the features of Hindu undivided family are.
First, membership of a family business is the result of status arising from birth in the family and hence there is no question of members been discriminated in terms of minority and majority on the basis of age.
The death or insolvency of a coparceners or even that of the kartha does not affect the membership of Hindu undivided family.
some of the merits of Hindu undivided family.
Irrespective of the contribution made, every coparcener in the successful running of the business gets an equal share of profit.
Secondly, as different generations of family works in the same business the younger generation gets an advantage and help to develop and acquire expertise without much difficulty.
It serves as an insurance cover for maintaining the children, widows, ailing or invalid members of the family.
some of the demerits of Hindu undivided family.
As all the coparceners and equal right to share the profit made out of the joint business ,there is no encouragement to work hard and to earn more.
And it makes the members of the family very unenterprising.
Secondly, it has been seen that some times the 'Karta' of the family , his freedom for his own personal benefits and gains.
Thirdly, there is a fear of disintegration under this form of business organisation.
the third form of business organisation is partnership firm .
Section 4 of the Indian Partnership Act, 1932 define partnership as the relation between persons who have agreed to share the profits of a business carried on by all or any of them acting for all.
Persons entering into partnership agreement are known as partners and collectively as firm, partnership firm.
The name with which the business is started is known as "FIRM NAME".
some of the features of partnership firm.
At least 2 persons are needed to form a partnership firm.
The Partnership Act, fixes no limit on the number of partners to form a partnership firm.
Whereas the Companies Act limits on the number of the partners.
And its fixes some limit.
It lays down that any partnership or association of more than 10 persons, in case of banking business and 20 in other business operations.
Whereas according to the Companies Act, 2013 the maximum number of persons in any association or partnership may be up to such number as may be prescribed by not exceeding 100.
This restriction will not applied to any association of partnership constituted by professionals like lawyers ,Chartered Accountants ,company secretaries etc.
Who are governed by their special laws.
Under the Companies Act 1956 there was a limit of maximum 20% partners and there was no exemption granted to the professionals.
Under this form of business organisation ,agreement form the basis of a relationship And not the status as in the case of Hindu joint family.
There must be an agreement between 2 or more person to enter into a partnership.
Simply holding a property in joint ownership cannot be considered as partnership.
It should be accompanied by certain business activities And the partners must agree to carry some lawful business.
There must be an agreement to share the profit and losses of the business of the partnership firm.
However sharing of profits is not conclusive proof of partnership.
Fundamental test to test the existence of partnership firm is that there must be an agency relationship between the partners.
some of the merits of partnership firm first this form of business organisation like sole proprietorship is also relatively free from legal formalities.
In terms of its formation registration of partnership firm is not mandatory under the Partnership Act ,1932.
There is a flexibility in the functioning of the day to day business of the firm .
As partnership business is not regulated by any law in its day to day businesses .
Just as a company business is regulated by the company law.
A partnership firm is able to make decisions without delay because partners can meet and discuss the business problems more frequently.
Since the liability of the partners is unlimited, they are more cautious in the running of the business.
No major amendments can be made effecting the basic nature of the partnership without the unanimous consent of all the partners.
Thus every partners view voice carry weight in partnership firm.
some of the demerits of the partnership firm.
First, there is insecurity with the business after the death, retirement or insolvency of a partner.
Secondly, it fails to inspire public confidence.
As a partnership business is not subjected to detailed regulations just as company business.
Thirdly, a partnership is even words than sole proprietorship.
It makes investment in the partnership business reluctantly difficult.
the fourth forms of business Organisation is company.
A company is an incorporated voluntary association of person in business having joint capital divided into transferable shares of a fixed value.
Along with the features of limited liability common seal and perpetual succession.
it may be a public, private, foreign small associate holding and subsidiary company.
Companies may be incorporated with limited liability of its members of with unlimited liability.
Liability of members maybe limited by share or by guarantee.
some of the features of the company .
First, a company is an artificial person created by law to achieve the objectives for which it is formed.
A company exist only in the concentration of law.
It is an artificial person as we have already discussed earlier in the sense.
And sense that it is created by a process other than natural birth and doesn't process the physical attributes of a natural person.
This form of business organisation, as a continuous existence and its life is not affected by the death, lunacy, insolvency , retirement of its members.
Member may come and go.
However the company continues its operation so long as it fulfill the requirements of the law under which it has been formed.
sum of the merits of the company.
First by issuing shares and debentures to the public. A public company can raise large amount of money.
Secondly ,under this form of business organisation shareholders have limited liability of shares as they hold in the company.
And their private property is not attached pull to recover the dues of the company.
Thirdly ,this form of business organisation has a continuous existence and its light is not affected by the death, lunacy insolvency or retirement of its members.
Members may come and go.
However the company continues its operation so long as it fulfills the requirement of the law under which it is formed.
Fourthly, transferability of shares.
Shares of a public company are freely transferable.
There as the restrictions are place in case of transfer of shares and case of private companies.
some of the demerits of the company.
First, largest number of legal formalities has to be fulfilled by this form of a company for which provisions of Companies Act are to be complied with.
There is a divorce between ownership and management of the company.
Under this form of business organisation, it has been seen that though every shareholder has the right to participate in the Annual General Meeting.
But in practice ,companies are managed by a small Number of persons who are able to perfect with that power over the company from year to year.
the fifth form of business organisation is cooperative society.
A Cooperative organisation is established principally with a view to rendering service to its members.
In a particular to the society in and in general also.
Yet this does not mean that such an organisation will not work for profit.
The capital of the Cooperative organisation is collected from its members in the form of share capital.
But as we know this constitutes only unlimited source of Business Finance.
As a result major part of capital is raised either by way of loan from the government or by way of grants from the government.
third is separate legal entity.
Fourthly, the management of a Cooperative organisation vest in managing the committee elected by member.
It is the General Body of the members which lays down the brode framework of policy within which the Managing committee has to function.
Some of the merits of the Cooperative Society .
First, it is easy to form a cooperative society as it is voluntary Association which does not required long and complicated legal premunirise.
As lays down by the law.
Any 10 adult persons can voluntary form themselves into an association and get it registered with the registrar of cooperative.
Secondly, the management of a Cooperative organisation invest in a managing committee elected by the members only.
And it is the General Body of the members which lays down the broad framework of policy within which the managing committee has to function.
Thirdly, members in a cooperative organisation have limited liability in contributing the capital shares as shareholders have in a company.
Fourthly, similar to the company the Cooperative also enjoy a separate legal entity of its own. Independent of the entity of its members who own it.
That's why the life of a cooperative organisation remains unaffected by the death insolvency of a member.
some of the demerits of a Cooperative Society.
First, the amount of capital that a cooperative can collect is very limited as of the member ship remains confined to a particular locality or region .
And also because the principle of one man one vote.
Secondly, in the day to day functioning of cooperative state government subject them to a variety of regulations which leads to the interference and slow growth.
Thirdly ,lack of secrecy is seen in the form of business organisation.
will discuss about corporate personality.
What do we mean by corporate personality? Corporate Personality is a creation of law.
Both English and Indian law recognise legal personality of a corporation.
A Corporation has a legal personality of its own and it can sue and can be sued in its own name.
It does not come to end with the death of its individual members and therefore has a perpetual existence.
However unlike natural persons a corporation can only act through its agents.
Besides corporation ,the banks ,railways, universities, colleges, church, temple, hospital etc. are also conferred legal personality.
Union of India states are also recognised as legal or juridic person.
Corporations are of 2 types .
First Corporation aggregate.
What do we mean by Corporation aggregate? This is an association of human beings united for the purpose of providing that certain interest.
A limited company is one of the best examples of Corporate etiquette.
This kind of cooperation is formed by the members who are in agreement to contribute to the capital of the company in furtherance of a common object.
Thus their liability is limited to the extent, the share holding in the company .
This principle of Corporate personality was recognised in the case of Salman vs Solomon and Company.
The Second form of cooperation is cooperation soul.
This kind of cooperation is stated by a single person who is personified and regarded by law as a legal person .
The single person exercises of some of his functions deals in legal capacity and has legal rights and duties towards the same.
The object of a corporation soul is similar to that of Corporation aggregate.
some of the advantages of incorporation.
First, independent corporate existence.
A corprated company has an independent corporate existence.
This means it has distinct legal personality independent of its members.
Secondly, limited liability one of the principal advantages of an incorporated company is the privilege of limited liability.
This is the main feature of registered companies which attract investors.
Thirdly, perpetual succession.
An incorporated company has continued succession that means the company shall remain it's a state and prove possession as the same entity with the same privileges and immune not with standing any change its members.
Corporate existence of a company is not affected by the death or insolvency of its members .
The death or insolvency of individual members does not a in any way affect its corporate existence.
Fourth ,Transferability of shares .
Section 82 of the Companies Act, 1956 specifically provides that the shares or other interest of any members in a company shall be movable property transferable in the manner provided by the articles of association of the company.
Thus the member of an incorporated company can dispose of his share by selling them in the open market and get back the mouse in the state.
The transferability of shares has 2 main advantages.
Firstly, it provide liquidity to the investors at the same time ensure stability to the company.
Similar position regarding the transbility of share supplies in the company and 2013.
fifth advantage of incorporation is separate property.
In corporation helps the property of the company to the clearly distinguished from that of its members.
Lastly ,the capacity to sue and be sued.
A company being a body corporate can sue and can be sued in its own name .
A criminal complaint can be filed by a company by the company has to be presented by a natural person.
some of the disadvantages of Incorporation.
Far more compliance and regulations need to deal with and there is an increasing risk of penalties.
Second, a company is more complicated and costly to wind up.
Directors a person is subject to regulations and can be find a found guilty of a criminal offence for failing to comply.
Director shall be held personally liable if he or she acts beyond the provisions of the company act .
Memorandum and articles of association has been ultrawide the company or the directors.
what are the learning outcomes by the end of this module? And having completed the essential readings an activity students would be able to categorise the common form of business organisations and their main features.
Then they shall be able to delineate the legal distinction between incorporated an unincorporated association.
Lastly the shall also be able to understand corporate personality and advantages and disadvantages of the same.
we will talk about one person company in other jurisdictions.
Can I introduce to one person company in 2005 in which the promoting individual is both the director and shareholder.
Only one person is allowed to apply for opening a limited company with the minimum capital of 100000 .
The Mendel law of China allows the owner to pay the investment capital at one time which bars him from opening a second company of the same kind.
Where as an Pakistan the amended law permits one person to form a single member company by filing with the registrar at the time of incorporation.
Where nomination in the prescribed form indicating at least 2 individuals to act as nominee director and alternate director.
In Singapore Company Amendment Act, 2004 deals with it.
Where as an United States seven state permits the formation and operation of single member limited liability company.
In most of the countries the law governing companies enable is single member company to have more than one director.
And grant exemptions to such companies from holding AGMS though records and documents are to be maintained.
Today's topic of discussion is objects, powers of the companies and their internal administration.
As discussed in earlier module that for incorporation for a registration of a company 2 important document are require to be prepare and filed with the registrar of the companies.
And these 2 documents are Memorandum of Association and Articles of Association.
As observed by pamam these are the document of great important in relation to the proposed company.
The memorandum of association and articles of association are now known as memorandum and articles in the present act of 2013.
These document are consider to be very important.
As they contain some fundamental clauses which describe condition of a companies incorporation.
It also discusses the alteration that can be done in memorandum and articles of association and the effects of such alterations.
The learning objectives of the module are.
First, to explain the different clauses or contain Memorandum and Articles of Association.
To discuss the procedure for alteration of Memorandum and Articles of Association of a company.
And lastly to discuss the importance of Memorandum and Articles of a company they hold, information of any company.
We will begin with memorandum of Association definition .
Memorandum of association of a company as originally framed or as altered from time to time is pursuance of any previous companies law.
Or of this act is laid down in section 2 subsection 28.
Memorandum of association enables a party dealing with the company to know with certainty as whether the contractual relationship to which they intend to enter with the company is within the objects of the company.
It is the main document of a company which defines its object .
And lays down the fundamental conditions upon which alone the company is allowed to be formed.
It governs the relationship of the company with the outside world and define the scope of it activities.
Memorandum of association enable’s a party dealing with the company to know with certainty as whether the contractual relation to which they intent to enter with the company is within the objects of the company or not.
In Ashbury Railway Carriage And Iron Company Limited vs Riche ,an Egyptian salt and soda Company Limited case .
It was held that memorandum of association of a company is the main charter of a company.
And it defines the limitation on the powers of a company.
And its states negatively that nothing shall be done be on the Ambit which a memorandum of a company prescribes.
What is the purpose of memorandum of association? The purpose of memorandum of association is to enable the shareholders, creditors and those who deal with the company to know what is permitted in the range of enterprise.
Now we will discuss about the contents of memorandum.
The first content of a memorandum is Name Clause.
The first clause of the memorandum has to state the name of a proposed company.
As company begin a legal person should have a name.
Because name of a corporation is a somber of its existence.
There are certain things which should be kept in mind while deciding on a company's name.
Like, no company can be registered with the name which in the opinion of the central government is undesirable.
And it should not be identical with the name of another registered company.
Secondaly ,whatever be the name of the company, if the liability of the members is limited the last word of the name of the company should contain limited.
And in the case of a private company, it should contain private limited.
If a company desire's to change its name then it can be done by passing a special resolution.
And with the approval of the central government specified in writing.
This section four subsection 1(A) of the Companies Act 2013 which corresponds to Section 13 1(A) of the Companies Act 1956 talks about the name clause.
Now the second clause of the memorandum is Registered Office.
The second clause of a memorandum must specify the state in which the registered office of the company is to be situated.
This should be done within 30 days of incorporation or commencement of business whichever is earlier.
And if a company desires to shift its registered office from one place to another within the same city ,town or village ,they can do it without passing a special resolution.
But if they want to shift it from one City to a different city all together then a special resolution has to be passed.
Section 12 subsection 15 states that no company shall change the place of its registered office from the jurisdiction of 1 registrar to the jurisdiction of another registrar within the same state.
Under such change are confirmed by the Regional Director on an application made by the company regarding the same in the prescribed manner.
Section 12 of the Companies Act 2013 lays down the provisions regarding registered office of a company.
It states that on inform 15th day of the incorporation of a company.
Now, the third clause is Object and Clause.
The third and the most important clause of memorandum must state the objects for which a company is proposed to be established.
It is essential that the public who subscribes for its shares should know clearly what the objects of the company are? In the case of a companies which are in existence immediately before the commencement of the Companies Amendment Act ,1965.
The object clause had simply to state the object of the company.
But in the case of a company to be registered after the amendment.
The object clause was required to state separately the main object, the other objects and states to which other objects extend.
What do we mean by main objects? Under this clause the company had to state their main objects.
And objects incidental to the attainment of this main object.
Secondly, other objects.
Under this, the other objects had to be stated by the company which is not included in the above option.
Third was stage to which object extended.
Under this, the companies whose objects were not confined to1 state , this clause had to mention the state whose territories the object extended.
Under the Companies Act 2013 Section 4 subsection 1(c) states the object of the clause of memorandum.
Which says that it does not contain categories of main objects and the other objects like it was contained in 1956 act.
It only specifies then the memorandum of a company should specify the objects for which a company is proposed to be incorporated .
And any matter considered necessary in furtherance there off.
Now the next clause is Capital Clause.
The last clause states that the amount of a nominal capital of the company and the number and the value of the shares into which it is divided.
Section 3 of the act prescribe the requirement that a public company must have a minimum paid up share of 5,00,000 rupees or such higher amount as may be prescribed.
And a private company is required to have a minimum paid up share capital of 1,00,000 rupee such or such hire amount as may be prescribed by its articles.
Where is Section sections 4 sub clause 1E of the Companies Act 2013 lays down no amount of minimum paid up share capital in case of both public or private company.
It just says that amount of share capital with which a company is to be registered.
And division of the same into shares which the subscribers to the memorandum agrees to subscribe shall not be less than 1 share.
And the number of the shares its subscriber to the memorandum intense to take should be indicated opposite his name.
This means no separate subscription clause is laid down in section 2013 as it was laid down in ccompanies act, 1956.
we will discuss about the Articles of Association.
Articles of Association are the second document which has to be registered along with the memorandum of articles of association of a company in case of some companies.
Companies which must have articles of association are unlimited companies.
Companies limited by guarantee and private companies limited by shares.
This document contains rules, regulation and by laws for the general administration of the company.
They may be prescribed as the internal regulation of the company governing its management emboarding the powers of the directors.
And officers of the company as well as the powers of the shareholders.
They lay down the mode and the manner in which the business of a company is to be conducted.
In framing of articles of association a care must be taken to see that regulations framed do not go beyond the past of the company itself.
And as as contemplated by the memorandum of association and nor should they be such as would violate any of the requirements of the Companies Act itself.
All clauses in the articles ultra-virus the Memorandum or the act shall be null and void.
we will discuss about the contents of articles of association.
Articles generally contain provisions relating to the following matters.
First share capital, different classes of shares of the shareholders and variations of their rights.
Second, allotment of shares.
Third, Calls on shares.
Fourth, Issue of share certificate.
Fifth, Issue of share warrants.
Sixth, transfer of shares.
Seventh, transmission of shares.
Eight , alteration of share capital.
Ninth, borrowing powers of the company.
Tenth , Rules regarding meetings.
Eleventh , Voting rights of the member.
Twelvth , Accounts and Audit.
Thirteenth , directors, their appointment and remuneration.
Fourteenth, Payment interest of the capital.
Fifteenth , common seal .
And sixteenth , winding up of a company.
According to Section 5 of the Companies Act ,2013 articles of a company contain the regulations for management of a company.
They contain prescribed content but additional content may be added if necessary for management of a company.
The articles may provide for entrenchment which means that entrance regulations or entrenched clauses of articles can be altered only under conditions which are more restrictive than the special resolutions.
Which is generally required for alteration of articles.
Provisions for entrenchment may be made at the time of formation of a company or later on by an ordinary resolution in case of a private company.
And while special resolution in the case of a public company.
Now, how can alteration of articles of a company be done.
Section 31 of the Companies Act ,1956 grants power to the every company to alter its articles whenever its desires by passing a special resolution.
Second distinction.
Fourth distinction is memorandum every company must have its own memorandum.
Whereas under the companies act it is necessary for all types of companies to have articles.
Fifth distinction is any act of the company which is ultra vire.
The memorandum is holy void and cannot be ratified even by the whole body of shareholders.
Where as under articles, any of the act of the company which is the ultravire the articles can be confirm by the shareholders if it is intra vires the memorandum.
we will talk about the doctrine of constructive notice.
What do we mean by the doctrine of constructive notice? Every person dealing with the company is deemed to have a constructive notice of the contents of the memorandum and articles of the company.
A person is expected to inspect the basic document of the company which are memorandum and articles.
And they are available at the office of the registrar of a company.
An outsider dealing with the company is presumed to have read the contents of the registered documents of the company.
The further presumption is that he has not only read inspected the documents but also have understood them fully in the proper sense.
So, the doctrine of rule of constructive notice is a presumption operating in favor of the companies against the outsider.
we will talk about the Doctrine of Indoor Management.
This doctrine is an exception to the doctrine of constructive notice.
This Doctrine has been applied to many companies liable in case where they deal are made by the directors.
First, whose appointment was defective.
Second, who were appointed properly but why yet to be delegated necessary authority.
Thirdly, who had not yet been appointed as directors.
Fourthly who have been delegated authority in a meeting which had been lacked quorum.
There are some exceptions to this Doctrine of Indoor Management.
Though the doctrine outsiders protection while dealing with registered companies.
Court in the case of Royal British Bank vs Turquand did not find it proper to apply the Doctrine in following cases and the protection was denied.
The first exception is knowledge of irregularity .
When a person dealing with the company has actual or constructive notice of the irregularity as regards internal management, then he cannot claim the benefit under the rule of indoor management.
He may in some cases be himself be a part of the internal procedure.
Second exception is negligence.
Where a person dealing with the company could discover the irregularity.
If he had made popular enquiries, he cannot claim the benefit of the rule of indoor management.
The protection of the rule is not available where the circumstances surrounding the contract a so suspicious as to invite enquiry and the outsider dealing with the company does not make proper enquiry.
Third is forgery.
Fourth is acts outside the scope of apparent authority.
If an officer of a company enters into a contract with the third party.
And if the act of the officer is beyond the scope of its authority, the company is not bound.
The Companies Act, 2013 stipulates the process of registration and incorporation of companies in India for all types of companies including private and public companies minimum 2 directors and 2 shareholders are required for incorporating a private company where is minimum 3 directors in 7 shareholders are required for incorporating a public company.
Minimum paid up share capital of a private company at the time of incorporation should be 1 lakh rupees and it should be rupees 5 lacs for a public company .
Companies which are set up with the foreign investment have to be incorporated under the Companies Act, 2013 with the registrar of the companies.
Once the company is registered in India, it is guided by the Indian laws.
A company is formed by registering the memorandum and articles of association with the registrar of companies of the state in which the office of the company is to be located.
Now will discuss about the registration of companies, doing business in a company form of organization gives it's promoters all the advantages of a corporate personality, which includes separate corporate existence.
If you incorporate a company you will not be held personally liable for certain accidents and liabilities consequently ,you may find it easier to obtain business insurance or attract investors.
Since they don't know, you are not personally responsible for the company's wellbeing, following the above reasons registration of a company is an important part of starting a business.
Therefore before registering a company one needs to fulfill some legal formalities for which promoters must make a decision regarding the type of company they want to start.
That is a public company or a private company or Limited or unlimited company and accordingly prepare documents for incorporation of company.
In this connection the memorandum and articles of association now known as memorandum and articles respectively in the Act, of 2013 are fundamental documents to be prepared.
Now formation of a company: section 3 of Companies Act, 2013 lays down the process of forming a company.
The section states that a company can be formed for any lawful purpose by 7 or more persons in case of public company and 2 or more persons in case of private company and by 1 person in the case of 1% company which is regarded as a private company by the 2013 Act.
They can do that by subscribing the names to a memorandum and complying with the requirements of the Act to Act, of 2013 in respect of a registration.
Section also states that the companies formed under subsection 1 May be either a company limited by shares or a company limited by guarantee or unlimited company ,provided that the memorandum of one person company shall indicate the name of the other person with his prior concern for the same and for the purpose of becoming a member of the company in the event of the subscribers death or his in capacity to contract .
It is also laid down in the Act, that the written consent should be filed with the registrar at the time of incorporation of the 1% company along with it a memorandum and articles by the said other person nominated should we filed.
It is further provided by the Act that if such other persons want to withdraw his consent he can do the same in the prescribed manner only.
In case of 1% company ,if some changes are brought in in regards of change in the name of the person or any other change then the company shall intimate to this registrar in the manner prescribed.
Now will talk about the memorandum and articles of association of a company.
In the case of Moosa Goolam Arif versus Ebrahim Goolam Arif, it was held by the court that the certificate of incorporation is a conclusive evidence for all purposes.
Now will talk about the pre incorporation contracts.
Sometimes contracts are made on behalf of a company even before it is duly incorporated.
But no contract can bind a company before it becomes capable of contracting, by incorporation .
2 consenting parties are necessary to a contract, whereas the company before incorporation is a non-entity and this was held in the case of Kenya versus baxter.
A company has no status prior to incorporation.
It can have no income before incorporation for tax purposes .
Shares cannot be acquired in the name of the company before incorporation and the transfer form is liable to be rejected where the name of a proposed company is entered in the column of a transferee .
Before incorporation of a company is concerned and done and this was held in the case of English and colonial procedure company.
In order to get the benefits of a corporate personality it is very necessary for an association of person to become incorporated under the Companies Act.
It would be a matter of inconvenience that an association of persons cannot perform any official business operation in the name of company before its incorporated.
Therefore promoters of a company may enter into the agreement for the benefit of the association of person or prospective company and these agreements are known as pre incorporation contracts.
One might question that why is company not liable even if it is beneficiary to contract or might also question that doesn't promoters work under principal agent relationship answer to such question with simple.
The company is not in legal existence at time of pre incorporation contracts.
A person not in legal existence cannot be a party to a contract as we all know and the previty to contract doctrine excludes company from this liability and this was held in the case of Canada versus Baxter and Phonogram Limited versus Lane case.
This position was confirmed , in pure common law sense, pre incorporation contracts does not bind the company.
But there are certain exceptions to this contract and these exceptions were developed in USA India and later in England.
These exceptions are first under the Specific Relief Act 1963, Section 15(h) and section 19(e) are the two important sections for pre incorporation contract .
Section 15 is about strangers right to sue, if he is entitled to a benefit or has any interest under the contract.
Although it has certain limitations, section 15(h) talks about the company being a stranger to Prem Corporation contract has the right to sue to the other contracting party.
But the necessary condition is that the contract should be warranted by the terms of its Incorporation .
This provision clearly negates the Common Law Doctrine which says that the company cannot ratify or adopt the pre incorporation contract.
Under this provision promoters can give his right to sue to the company whereas the relevant portion of section 19 sub clause(e) states that except otherwise provided by this chapter, specific performance of a contract maybe and enforced against ,when promoters of a company have before its incorporation entered into a contract, warranted by the terms of the incorporation provided that the company has accepted the contract and communicated such acceptance to the other party to the contract .
This position was accepted in the case of Vali Pattabhirama Rao And Anr. vs Sri Ramanuja Ginning And Rice Factory Private Limited.
The second exception is novation of contract .
What do we mean by novation of contract?In the situation of novation of contract, the company can replace the promoter from the pre incorporation contract.
But one might say that such contract would not be called pre incorporation contract ,but it should be called post incorporation contract because novation of contract result into a new contract.
This position of novation of contract was accepted in the case of Howard vs Patent Ivory Company manufacturing company.
Now will talk about the incorporation of company under the Companies Act, 2013 .
Under the Companies Act, 1956 for incorporation all the important documents are filed with the registrar of the company .
There as under 2013 section 7 talks about the incorporation of a company and its states that the documents shall be filed by the company to the registrar within whose jurisdiction the registered office of a company is proposed to be situated.
Subsection 1 of section 7 Lays down the list of following documents and information which is required to be filed by the company for incorporation.
Sub section 3 of section 7 of this Act states that on inform the date mentioned in the certificate of incorporation the registrar shall allow to the company a corporate Identity Number ,which will provide a distinct identity to the company and will also be mentioned in the certificate.
Under the present Act of 2013 the company shall also maintain and preserve at its registered office all the documents and information filed and if any person furnishes any false information, he shall be liable under section 477 of the given Act.
Regarding the above penal action or Tribunal may pass an order, as it may think fit for regulation of the management of the company or may direct to remove the name of the company from the register of the companies on being satisfied.
After the certificate of incorporation issue the registrar shall allot the company corporate Identity Number as we have already discussed.
Provided that before passing any order in regard the Tribunal should give a company a reasonable opportunity of being heard and the Tribunal shall take into consideration the transaction entered by the company including the obligations if any contracted or payment of any liability.
Now we will talk about the commencement of business under the Companies Act, 1956 a private company had the right to commence its business right from the date of its Incorporation.
However in the case of a public company a certificate of commencement of business have to be obtained .
For this purpose the following additional formalities had to be complied with section 149(7) of the Companies Act, 1956 .
If a company had a share capital and had issued a prospectus ,then first shares up to the amount of minimum subscription must be allotted.
Secondly every director must have paid to the company one company on each of the shares which he has taken same amount as the public have paid on such shares .
Thirdly no money is or may become payable to the applicants of shares or debentures for failure to apply for or to obtain permission to deal in in those shares or debentures in any recognized stock exchange.
Fourthly a statutory declaration in form 19 signed by one director or the employee, company secretary or a company secretary in whole time practice that the above provisions have been complied must be filed.
And if a company has share capital but did not issue a prospectus, then what happens in this case?First it must file a statement in lieu of prospectus with the registrar of the companies.
Every director must have paid to the company on each of the shares which he has taken same amount as the other members has paid on such shares.
Thirdly a statutory declaration in form 20 by 1 director or the employee a company secretary or a company secretary in whole time practice that the above provisions have been complied with must be filed.
Once the above provisions have been complied with the registrar of the company grants certificate of commencement of business after which the company can comments is activities.
Under the Companies Act, 2013 a company having a share capital is not entitled to commence its business or exercise borrowings pars unless firstly a declaration is filed by the director of the company with the registrar of the companies that every subscriber to the memorandum has paid the value of the shares agreed to have been taken by him and the paid up share capital of the company is rupees 5 lacs.
In case of a public company and 1 lakh in the case of the private company secondly the company has file with the registrar of the companies of verification of its registered office.
In case no declaration is filed by director of the company within 180 days of the incorporation of the company the ROC has reasonable belief that the company is not carrying on any business or is not in operation and he may initiate action for removal of companies name from the register of the companies.
Now let's look at the procedure for formation of a company in India.
What are the different steps a person has to follow to form its company under Indian law the first step is to obtain directors identification number for the proposed directors of the company.
Third step is to file an application for the approval of the name of the company fourth step is preparing the memorandum of association and articles of association of the company which are very important document.
Fifth step is to have the appropriate Number of persons to subscribe to the Memorandum of the company minimum 2 in the case of private company and minimum 7 in the case of public company as we have already discussed it.
Sixth step is to submit all the documents along with the required fees to the registrar of the company .
Seventh step is registrar of the company should issue a receipt of certificate of incorporation after all these documents are filed by the company in prescribed manner, then the eighth step is in case of a public company obtain a certificate of commencement of business from ROC.
Finally after doing all these formalities a company come into existence and you can start your business.
Now let's talk about companies incorporation fourth amendment rules, 2016 and simplified process for incorporating companies electronically that is SPICe form.
The Ministry of Corporate Affairs in exercise of the parts conferred by subsection 1 and 2 of section 469 of the Companies Act, 2013 by its notification dated October first 2016 and amended the rule and introduced rule 38.

Hello everyone I am Dr. Aparajita Bhatt from National Law University Delhi.
The topic for this modulus is Compromise, Arrangement, Reconstruction, Mergers and Amalgamation of companies in India.
You shall be able to understand about the concept of corporate restructuring, merger and amalgamation other learning objectives are that you shall also be able to understand about the legal provisions related to mergers and amalgamations under the Companies Act, 2013.
And you shall also be able to understand about the role of Judiciary on National Company Law Tribunal in sanctioning the scheme of merger or amalgamation.
We shall discuss under this module the meaning of corporate restructuring, the need of corporate restructuring, various forms of corporate restructuring and the legal issues pertaining to mergers and amalgamations in India.
Now before we proceed we must understand and discuss the meaning of corporate restructuring as to what is meant by this term.
Corporate restructuring is a general term used for various kinds of business transactions which are required for the growth of a company.
Such business transactions are governed by different regulations in different jurisdictions.
Now what is the need for corporate restructuring we must understand this.
Companies restructure themselves they have to mandatorily reach restructure themselves for two basic purposes.
The first one is the survival of the purpose of basic sustenance in the market in the industry and the second important reason is growth.
There are various forms of corporate restructuring which are prevalent in the corporate sector.
One such form is organic or which is also known as internal restructuring.
Organic restructuring is done within the organ of the company within the system of the company.
It can be divided into following categories: Operational restructuring, financial restructuring, managerial restructuring.
Now all these three kinds of restructuring are done within the organ of the company and therefore they are known as organic restructuring or internal restructuring.
Another kind of restructuring is inorganic or external restructuring.
They can be divided into say mergers, amalgamations, acquisitions.
All these are forms of inorganic or external restructuring because an external company or an external element is involved into the entire process of restructuring.
There are various other common forms of corporate restructuring exercises and they include expansion.
In case of expansion the most common forms of expansion are merger, amalgamation, tender offers and joint ventures.
Another category is sell offs which includes spin offs, split offs, split ups, divestitures and equity carve outs.
Another kind of corporate restructuring activity is corporate control which includes exercises such as premium buybacks, standstill agreements, anti-takeover amendments, proxy contests etc.
And the last category can be the changes in ownership structure which includes share repurchase, various exchange offers and going private such as LBOs and MBOs that is Leverage Buyout and Management Buyout.
Now there are many reasons why company should restructure themselves which we’ll discuss under this topic that is reasons for corporate restructuring.
The most common reason are for example such has economies of scale, synergy.
So therefore we can divide these reasons into following categories: One can be the companies wish to concentrate on area of core competency or area of their specialization.
Another can be to achieve economies of scale by expansion.
Companies also restructure themselves for geographical and product diversification.
They also wish to achieve operational synergy and efficient allocation of managerial capabilities.
Another important reason for corporate restructuring is the revival and rehabilitation of sick companies.
Vertical integration it enables acquiring constant supply of raw material and access to scientific research and technical knowhow and companies also restructure themselves to improve corporate performance and bring it at par with their competitors.
Now let's discuss and understand the meaning of each one of these forms of corporate restructuring exercises very briefly.
The first one is merger.
What is a merger? Merger is the combination of two or more companies into a single company where one survives and the other loses its identity.
Now in case of a merger all the assets, all the liabilities and all the shareholders that are transferred by the transferor company to the transferee company.
And the consideration in such a case is in the form of equity shares debentures or a combination of two or three modes.
So merger the difference of the amalgamation.
In case of merger there are two companies A and B so when they merge either A would survive or B would survive, whichever is the stronger company whichever is the healthy company.
But in case of amalgamation when both the companies so amalgamate or blend into each other to form a third new entity that is <eqn>A plus b is equals to C</eqn> then that is a case of amalgamation.
So what exactly is an amalgamation? An amalgamation is the blending of two or more companies existing undertaking into one undertaking.
The shareholders of each blending company they become the shareholders of the company which is the blended one which is the new entity.
And the assets and liabilities of both the companies are transferred to the newly formed entity.
In such a case the offer is to purchase some or all of shareholder shares in a corporation.
The price offered and tender offer is usually at a premium to the market price and it can be either friendly or unfriendly.
What are joint ventures? Joint ventures are intersection of only a small fraction of the activities of the companies involved.
It is done for a limited duration of 10 to 15 years or even less.
The companies may represent a separate entity in which each of the parties makes cash and other forms of investments.
It is a business agreement in which parties agree to develop, for a finite period and the new entity and new assets by contributing equity.
In case of a joint venture the companies exercise control over the enterprise and share revenues, they share expenses and they also share assets.
And because of this sharing nature they are known as joint ventures.
And in this case cash or equivalent consideration is received by the divesting firm.
The buyer is an existing firms so that no new legal entity results in case of a divestiture and it simply represents a form of expansion on the part of the buying firm.
Similarly equity carve-out is another variant it is the Initial Public Offering that is IPO of some portion of the common stock of a wholly owned subsidiary.
They are also referred as the "Split-off IPOs".
It involves the sale of a portion of the firm via an equity offering to outsiders.
New shares of equity they are sold to outsiders which give them ownership of a portion of the previously existing firm.
And in this case a new legal entity is created.
Similarly premium buy-backs say an another form of corporate restructuring exercise wherein the repurchase of a substantial stockholders ownership interest at a premium above the market prices is done.
A standstill agreement is written and it represents a voluntary contract in which the stockholders simply agrees not to increase his or her ownership beyond the ownership which is there in the hands of the management which presumably would put him or her in an effective control position.
Antita keover amendments they are changes in the corporate by laws to make an acquisition of the company more difficult or more expensive.
Similarly proxy contest, in this case an outside group seeks to obtain representation on the firms board of directors.
"Dissidents" or "insurgents" who seek to reduce the control position of the "incumbents" or existing board of directors.
And therefore in this case usually it is regarded as directed against the existing management of the company.
This is the proxy contest.
Changes in ownership structure in such a case the exchange offers where in the exchange of debt or preferred stock for common stock is done.
And in case of share repurchase the corporation buys back some fraction of its outstanding shares of common stock.
Another firm is going private transaction which includes activities such as LBOs that is Leveraged Buyout and MBOs that is Management Buyout.
Going private transactions typically include members of the incumbent management group who obtain a substantial proportion of the equity ownership of the newly private company.
When the transaction is initiated by the incumbent management it is referred to as management buy-out.
And in case of leveraged buy-out a type of aggressive business practice whereby the investors or a larger Corporation utilizes borrowed funds or debt to finance its acquisition.
Now integration or merger can further be divided into vertical merger, horizontal merger, conglomerate merger.
In case of an horizontal merger two firms which operate in the same kind of business activity they merge with each other, the main purpose of this kind of merger is to obtain economies of scale to reduce the investment in operations and broadening the products line, reduction in investment in working capital, elimination of competition concentration, in products reduction of advertising costs and increase in market area.
And an example of horizontal merger can be a merger between two steel firms would be a case of horizontal merger.
Similarly in case of a vertical merger or vertical integration it is done to expand espousing backward integration to assimilate the sources of supply and forward integration towards market outlets.
In case of a vertical integration the acquiring company through merger of another units attempts on reduction of inventories and it implements its production plans as per objectives and economizes on working capital investment.
In a vertical combination, the merging undertaking would be either a supplier or buyer using its product as intermediary material for its final production.
And in case of a conglomerate merger this is a merger between two unrelated business firms.
So the basic purpose of conglomerate amalgamations remains utilization of financial resources and enlarged debt capacity through reorganizing their financial structure.
It also enhances the overall activity of the acquirer company and creates balance in companies total portfolio of diverse products and production processes.
Demerger is another form of corporate restructuring exercise in which a case the corporate splits or divide the companies.
It’s a division of the company.
It signifies the movement in the company just opposite to merger just opposite to combination.
This particular kind of restructuring exercise is common in developed nation such as U.K and U.S.A and also in developing nations like India.
We find many examples of demerger taking place in Indian corporate sector a common example is when Reliance Industries Limited demerged into various other undertakings.
Another variants is or a form of corporate restructuring is reverse merger, this is also known as reverse takeovers or reverse IPOs and it is a way for private companies to go public.
It is a simpler, shorter and expensive way to restructure itself.
A conventional IPO is more complicated and expensive, as private companies they have to hire and invest bank to underwrite and issue shares of the soon-to-be public companies.
So reverse merger is a good alternative to the traditional IP route.
After having discussed these various forms of corporate restructuring exercises now let us discuss the legal provisions relating to mergers and amalgamations under the Companies Act 2013.
Companies Act 2013 is the new at and it has replaced the provisions of the Companies Act 1956.
But the sections related to mergers and amalgamations under the Companies Act 2013 they are still not notified and they are still not enforce.
Still the main provisions are given from section 230 onwards the corresponding provisions were given under section 391 to 396 of the Companies Act 1956.
To merge or to amalgamates is a power of the company which is conferred on the company by the Companies Act 1956 and now the Companies Act 2013.
So Companies Act 2013 section 230 makes it a power to compromise and make arrangements with creditors and members.
In this case there is an entire procedure given by the act which the companies have to mandatory follow.
One such procedure is to come out various disclosures, so the company is required to disclose the following information to the Tribunal.
The first information is that all material facts relating to the company, such as latest financial position, the latest auditor's report, pendency of any investigation of proceeding against the company they have to be disclosed.
Another important disclosure is that is there if any reduction of share capital of the company if there is any then it should be included in the compromise or arrangement and another disclosure is that any scheme of corporate debt restructuring consented to by not less than 75% of the secured creditors and value.
So therefore for this power to be exercise under section 230 the companies have to obtain at least 75% of the consent of secured creditors in value.
Similarly it requires and it mandates that notice of the meeting with has been convened or conducted or called upon by the tribunal and by the high court under the Companies Act 1956.
Such a notice of this meeting should be individually sent to all the creditors and their classes to all the members and their classes and to all the debenture holders classes.
Such notice should be placed on the website of the company.
If the company is a listed company then all these documents shall be notified to SEBI that I Securities Exchange Board of India and also the stock exchanges where the securities of the companies listed.
The notice shall also be published in the newspaper and the notice shall be sent to all the regulatory authorities another sectoral regulator's.
It is a mandatory provision that now for all the purposes of transparency and to make sure that things are done in a fair and just manner.
The notice should be sent to all the regulatory authorities including SEBI including Central Government, the state government, all the stock exchanges where the stock the shares of the company are listed, the RBI registrar of companies and therefore it should be sent to all sectoral regulators and all other regulators.
The tribunal has to satisfy itself on various grounds before sanctioning the scheme.
No scheme shall be sanctioned unless a certificate by the companies auditor has been filed with the tribunal to the effect that the accounting treatment is in conformity with the accounting standards.
Now before sanctioning the scheme there are various grounds depending on which the tribunal will sanction the scheme.
The grounds are that the scheme should be just, the scheme should be fair, it should be reasonable, it should not be against public interest and it should not be against interest of the minority shareholders.
Now under the Companies Act 1956 section 391 is supposed to be or was supposed to be a complete code in itself and it was considered to be a single window clearance system.
The whole purpose is to reconstitute the company without the company being required to make a number of applications under the Companies Act.
For various alterations which are required under the merger scheme and which may be required in the memorandum and the articles of a company.
So therefore all such alterations are done at the stage of section 391 under the Companies Act 1956 and under section 230 under the Companies Act 2013.
And this is one reason why it is known as a complete code in itself a single window clearance system.
But now there is a complete contract from the previous act to the new act that because consent has to be taken, representation has to be made by all the sectoral regulator, notice has to be sent to all the sectoral regulators, it is no more a single window clearance system now it has become a multiple window clearance system.
We also discuss that the scheme should not only be just and fair but it should also appear to be reasonable.
What is meant by reasonableness of a scheme? It means that the arrangements can reasonably be suppose by sensible business people to be for the benefit of the class which they represent.
Now there are various case laws to be disclosed under this.
One such case is Sidhpur Mills Company Limited In re, decided the 1980 by Gujarat Court.
It was held in this case that the scheme should be looked at from the view point of ordinary reasonable shareholder acting in a business like manner taking within his comprehensions and bearing in mind all the circumstances prevailing at the time when the meeting was called upon to consider the scheme.
Though the court would see whether a scheme is fair and reasonable, the initial burden in this respect would be that of the petitioner.
The same ratio was followed in another case that is in Navjeevan Mills Limited.
 decided in 1972 it was also held that the scheme should not contravene any law and should not be mala fide for a collateral purpose.
Other court would look into or the National Company Law Tribunal would look into the bonafides of the proponent, it would see that whether it is in public interest and reasonable and also in the interest of creditors of the company.
Another landmark judgments in this respect is that of Hindustan liver Employees Union vs Hindustan Lever Limited decided in 1995 by the supreme court.
It was held in this case that unless it is shown that there is some illegality or fraud involved in the scheme the court cannot decline to sanction scheme of arrangement.
It was also held that where a scheme of amalgamation is sanctioned almost unanimously by the shareholders, debenture holders, secured creditors, unsecured creditors and preference shareholders of both the companies there must exist very strong reasons for withholding sanction to such a scheme.
With holding of sanction in such a case may turn out to be disastrous for shareholders and employees and also for the economy of the country.
Now it is the discretionary power of the court or the tribunal under the Companies Act 2013 which is exercise.
On the issue of "discretion of the court" the court enjoys vast powers, wide powers of discretion.
Such power of discretion ranges from ordering the meeting, refusing a meeting, sanctioning a scheme, rejecting a refusing a scheme, making order to modify the scheme, as well as to wind up the companies where schemes are not workable.
An important case law in this regard is Mahendra Kumar Sanghi vs. Ratan Kumar Sanghi.
In this case it was held that it is obligatory upon the court to scrutinize the scheme and to see whether it conforms to the standards of reasonableness.
It must also be ensured that the majority having interest of its own clashing with those of the minority whom they seek to coerce.
So therefore the minority vs. majority interest should also be checked before sanctioning approving the scheme of merger.
Another important decision was that the scheme once passed or once approved by the court or the tribunal it becomes binding on the company, on all the creditors or members or the classes or in case of a company being wound up on the liquidator and the contributories of the company.
It shall have the same binding effects as the order of a High Court.
No scheme shall be sanctioned unless a certificate by the company’s auditor has been filed with the tribunal to the effect that the accounting treatment is in conformity with the accounting standards.
Now under section 231 of the Companies Act 2013 the tribunal enjoys vast power to enforce compromise and arrangement.
And as we just discuss these powers are of the nature of the tribunal can order a meeting, it can sanction a scheme, it can reject the scheme, it can modify the scheme, as well as it can make order to wind up the companies, if the ground for winding up are present there.
Now mergers and amalgamation of companies provisions relating to this are provided under section 232.
Section 232 is a facilitator provision it facilitates mergers and amalgamation under the companies act.
It says and states that whether it is shown to the tribunal that the compromise or arrangement has been proposed for the purpose of reconstruction of the company and under the scheme the whole or any part of the undertaking, property or liability of the transferor company is required to be transferred to the transferee company.
The tribunal may order a meeting of the creditors or members or their classes.
The tribunal in such a case may make the following provision: The transfer of the whole or part of the undertaking property or liability of the transferor company to the transferee company.
The allotment or appropriation by the transferee company of any shares, debentures, policies or other instruments in the company.
The continuation by or against the transferee company of any legal proceeding pending by or against the transferor company on the date of the transfer.
Dissolution it can also order direct dissolution of the company without winding up of any transferor company.
It can also order or make provision for the transfer of the employees of the transferor company to the transferee company.
And also make provisions such for such incidental, consequential and supplemental matter as are deemed necessary to secure that the merger and amalgamation is fully and effectively carried out.
Section 234 of the New Companies Act 2013 provides and facilitate cross border mergers.
Now this profession is a little different from the similar provision under the previous companies Act.
Whereas under the Companies Act 1956 it allowed only one way cross border merger that was anybody corporate was allowed to merge with an Indian company which is incorporated under the Indian companies Act whereas the vice versa was not allowed.
Now under section 234 two way cross border mergers and amalgamations are allowed.
So now an Indian company can merge with the foreign company and also a foreign company can merge into a Indian company.
This is subject to the approval of RBI the central bank.
And that through with selected jurisdictions only.
Amalgamation of companies in public interest is provided under section 237 of the New Companies act 2013.
This particular provision it provides us with faster process of amalgamation of companies.
The power in this case to order such a kind of amalgamation is vested directly into the hands of central government.
It provides for redressal mechanism for the dissenting shareholders and provides that any person whose aggrieved by the assessment of compensation made by the prescribed authority within a period of 30 days may prefer an appeal to the tribunal.
Another important provision under the New Companies act is with respect to mergers and amalgamations for revival and rehabilitation of sick companies.
This is given under section 261 of the new companies Act.
It provides that the company administrator may draft a scheme and provide for the amalgamation of the sick company with any other company or any other company with the sick company.
So both way merger and amalgamation is allowed.
The scheme so drafted by the administrator may also provide for the takeover of a sick company by a solvent company.
Now after having discussed these important legal provisions we also should understand and analyze as to what is the role of judiciary in sanctioning the scheme of merger.
Under the Companies Act 1956 High Court enjoyed and still enjoys wide powers to sanction a scheme and approve such scheme.
The powers of the tribunal now under the 2013 act they include power to sanction the scheme, power to stay proceedings, power to reject or modify the scheme and power to order winding up of the companies.
Important case laws are required to be discussed here which would help us to understand the role of judiciary in not only explaining the meaning of important terms as well as also making us understand the entire procedure before sanctioning the scheme.
One such important case is Saraswathi Industrial Syndicate vs. CIT, Haryana decided in 1991 by the Apex court.
It was held and the Supreme Court explained the concept of amalgamation.
The court stated that is in amalgamation two or more companies are fused into one by merger or by one taking over the other.
When two companies are merged and are so joined as to form a third company or one is absorbed into the other or blended with another the amalgamating company loses its identity.
There may be amalgamation either by transfer of two or more undertakings to an existing company.
Similarly another important case General Radio and Appliances Limited vs. M.A.Khader, decided in 1986 by the Supreme Court.
It was stated in this case that after the amalgamation of two companies the transferor company acquires a new status and it is not possible to treat the two companies at partners or jointly liable in respect of their liabilities and assets.
Very important issue which arises here is that whether anyone has the right to raise objection to the scheme or not.
Now, because the entire procedure of sanctioning the scheme is based on a fundamental principle of corporate democracy.
It is important to give this right to raise objection and make representation to the stakeholder.
Now there is a difference on this point between the Companies Act 1956 and Companies Act 2013 whereas under Companies Act 1956, any interested party was allowed to raise objection at any stage before the court approved the scheme.
Under the Companies Act 2013 only those shareholders can raise an objection who hold at least 10% of shareholding or only those creditors can raise objection who hold at least 5% of outstanding debt.
Therefore the New Companies Act that has provided a criteria for those people, for those shareholders, stakeholders, creditors who have a right to raise objection and now it is not that anyone can raise objection anytime this is just to make sure that they are not many frivolous preparations of frivolous applications for the rejection of the scheme that a put up of pending before the Judiciary before the court or before the tribunal.
Therefore now we conclude today under this module we discussed the concept, the meaning of corporate restructuring, various forms of corporate restructuring, the need for corporate restructuring.
We also discussed what are the various forms of mergers that is vertical merger, horizontal merger, conglomerate merger then we discuss the legal provisions pertaining to mergers and amalgamation under the New Companies Act 2013 and finally we also discuss few relevant, few important judgments of the Supreme Court.
Wherein the court explained the concept of amalgamation, explained the concept of merger and also explained various criteria for example it was laid down in Miheer H Mafatlal vs. Mafatlal Industries Limited.
Also in the case of Hindustan Lever Employees Union Limited that any scheme of merger should not be against minority interest, should not be against public interest.
It should be just, it should be fair, it should be reasonable.
Therefore these are various criteria’s which the judiciary, which the tribunal has to make sure of before approving or before sanctioning a scheme of merger or amalgamation.
Hello everyone, I am Dr. Aparajita Bhatt from National Law University Delhi.
The topic for this module is takeovers and acquisitions.
The learning objectives of this module are that you shall be able to understand the concept of takeovers and acquisitions.
You shall also be able to understand and appreciate the difference between takeover, acquisition and mergers and you should also be able to understand where is legal provisions governing takeovers in India.
We must understand what is meant by takeover.
Takeover and acquisition is a form of inorganic corporate restructuring where the management of the company changes its hands.
A takeover takes place when one company acquires controlling interest over another company.
There are many kinds of takeovers which are prevalent in the corporate sector.
One is friendly takeover for example when Dabur required Balsara group that’s an example of friendly takeover.
Another category is hostile takeover for example when HP acquired Compaq and the third new category which is altogether different is Bailout takeover.
Now let us briefly understand the meaning of all these 3 kinds of takeovers.
In case of a friendly takeover when it is done with the consent of board of directors or board of management of the target company.
So, because the elements of consent is present, it is a friendly takeover.
In case of a hostile takeover, when such a takeover is done without the consent of the board of management of the target company if the board rejects the offer then the bidder continues to pursue it.
Therefore this against the wishes or without the consent of the board of management of the target company and therefore it is a hostile takeover.
And a third category which is altogether different from friendly or hostile is a bailout takeover.
In case of a bailout take over the financially weak company which is the target company is bailed out to a strong company with the interference of a financial institution or a bank.
Now let us understand the difference between a takeover and merger because both of them are inorganic or external forms of corporate restructuring exercises.
In case of merger or amalgamation both the companies become one they blend into one, they merge into one with each other, whereas in case of a takeover, there continues to be two distinct companies and the assets, liabilities and stocks they are not shared or merged.
We must also understand the difference between takeover and acquisition both these terms takeover and acquisition they sounds to be and are used to be synonymously.
But there is the difference between both these terms.
In case of an acquisition it necessary involves the purchase of shares of the target company.
Which can further leads to acquisition of voting power.
When such an acquisition of voting power or such an acquisition of shares or the purchase of shares it is within intention to take control of the target company such kind of acquisition becomes a takeover.
Therefore irrespective of whether there is a takeover of a company or not there is necessarily present an acquisition of shares and it occurs whenever shares of the target company changes hands.
Therefore in case of a takeover the element of intention to control the management of the target companies present whereas in case of a simple acquisition of shares this element of intention to control the target company is necessarily not present.
Now there are various kinds of companies as we know there are private companies in public companies which can further be divided into listed and unlisted Company.
So, the takeover procedure or mechanism of listed and unlisted company are different.
Takeover of unlisted company or presently governed by the companies act under section 395.
Under this section it is both a power as well as a duty of the acquirer company to acquire shares of the target company.
Because this is a takeover of the unlisted company it requires lesser procedural compliance but which whatever is required is mentioned under the companies act.
And the dissenting shareholders they are offered of compensation a fair compensation and they also have an option to exit the company to exit the offer if they are not interested to be involved in the process of takeover.
Whereas takeover of listed companies because they are listed on stock exchanges they are governed by SEBI the Securities Exchange Board of India.
So, takeover of listed companies is governed by SEBI takeover regulations 2011.
Now, there is a set of regulations which governs takeovers and acquisitions in India.
These regulations include the Indian Companies Act, the SEBI SAST takeover regulations 2011, the Securities Contract Regulation Act 1957 and also the Listing Agreement.
Before we proceed and discuss the legal provisions relating to take over and acquisition under the takeover court 2011.
Let us try and understand that what was the need to have this takeover code in our country.
The need to govern takeovers and acquisitions, it emerge from the need to govern those companies and those corporate houses which made it a fashion to acquire controlling interest in other companies.
Takeover turns hostile when it is done without the consent of board of directors of the target company.
So, there are all probability that such an acquisition would adversely affect the interest of minority shareholders, the other stakeholders of the target company and as we all know that take over is a corporate decision it should be beneficial not only for the acquirer company but also it should be beneficial for the shareholders at large and not merely for the benefit of the individuals.
Because of the complexity of the nature of takeover and also to protect the interest of small investors as well as the target company a need were felt to develop a code to regulate and to govern the entire process of acquisition and takeover which is base on principle of transparency, which is based on principle of fairness and equal opportunity to all.
A greater need was felt and it was realized only after the introduction of the LPG model as we all know its the liberalization, privatization, and globalization model which was introduced in 1991.
So, only after introduction of this LPG model in 1991 it was felt that we need to have a set of regulation, we need to have a code which could govern the cross border corporate restructuring activities, cross border takeovers, cross border, amalgamation and acquisitions.
Therefore this LPG model it opens the gates of Indian economy for foreign investors and it began a trend where in the companies wanted to restructure themselves by inorganic means such as merger and amalgamations.
The most important reason behind having a proper takeover regulation was to achieve the objective behind the SEBI Act.
And the main objective behind the SEBI Act is given under section 11 of the SEBI Act that is to protect the interest of the shareholders of the target companies besides achieving the desired target of the acquirer companies.
Need was felt to have a code to have a regulation which could imbibed within itself the principles of corporate democracy, the principle of transparency, fairness and equal opportunity for all.
With such brought objective SEBI enacted the takeover regulations 1994.
Which was further amended in 1997 and still further amended in the year 2011.
And now what we have to govern the takeover or acquisition activities in India is the SEBI SAST regulations 2011.
In the light of the changing market policies and changing needs of the corporate world there was again in need felt for new regulations to govern mergers and acquisitions.
Thus, in 2009 a committee which was constituted under the chairmanship of Achuthan Mr.
Now let us also discuss the trend of takeovers and acquisitions in India.
The trend of takeover and acquisitions in India it witnessed significant regulatory changes in 2011 as we just discussed.
And when this new takeover regulations 2011 came into force it brought with several unique feature which now govern the takeover transactions the acquisition transactions in a country.
And specially replies to public listed companies.
The basic principles which applies to an acquisition and the takeover is that in case of a takeover compliance of both the takeover code as well as the act is necessary.
While in case of only acquisitions specially in case of acquisition of unlisted companies compliance only of the actors required.
Similarly there are other variance which can be added to it so when acquisition becomes a takeover the provision of SEBI takeover code 2011 becomes applicable as we all know.
Similarly if an acquisition results in a combination then along with the takeover code 2011, the provisions of the Competition Act 2002, which were for the amended in 2007 would also apply and the approval of competition Commission of India is required in such a case.
And if the acquisition results in either inflow or outflow of funds to and from India then the provisions of FEMA 1999 that is the Foreign Exchange management Act 1999, would also become applicable along with the takeover code 2011.
Now after having discussed the basic, the fundamental concepts, the meaning of takeover acquisition and the differences between them now let us discuss the various legal provisions.
SEBI is a body is an authority which has given to us a very comprehensive set up regulation which governs all forms of takeover activities in India.
And therefore all kinds of takeover whether friendly, whether hostile have two necessarily go through the procedure which is given under the SEBI takeover code.
This code involves the acquisition of shares in a substantial percentage which leads to acquisition of control and finally takeover of a target company.
It also applies to acquisition by a company.
this acquisition can be acquisition of shares, acquisition of voting power and acquisition of control.
Acquisition of shares can be either direct acquisition or indirect acquisition.
Now what is direct acquisition? A direct acquisition is when control of a public listed company is by way of acquisition of shares of the target company directly.
Whereas an indirect acquisition it is done by acquiring shares of a holding company or a parent company of the target company.
Therefore both these forms of acquisition they are given under SEBI takeover code and are governed by the same regulation.
SEBI takeover code also gives to us a process which is known as an open offer process.
The takeover code mandates an open offer process for both direct as well as indirect acquisition of shares, voting rights or control if such acquisition triggers the threshold prescribed under the takeover code.
Now what is this threshold we need to understand this.
This threshold is given under regulation 3 of the takeover code 2011.
Regulation 3 gives to us the concept of substantial acquisition of shares, voting rights and control.
This percentage which is given under the takeover code 2011 was quite low under the previous takeover regulation.
It was only 15% but now they have increased it to 25% which comes in the form of relaxation both to the acquirer companies as well as to the shareholders.
The open offer process requirement should be fulfilled only when there is a substantial acquisition of shares of voting rights or control.
Having done substantial acquisition of shares or voting rights or control by making a public announcement if an acquirer has to acquire additional shares, which entitles him to exercise more than 5% of voting rights in a financial year he is again required to make public announcement of an open offer.
From this week gets the concept of creeping acquisition.
The concept of creeping acquisition allows an acquirer to acquire additional shares every year I mean every financial year up to 5% for which he is not required to follow the open offer process.
So, if he acquires 5% up to 5% in one financial year for that he is not required to make public announcement, he is not required to follow any open offer process.
So, therefore this is a slow acquisition, this is a creeping acquisition.
This can be done only once he has acquired substantial acquisition of shares, he has done substantial acquisition of shares or control or voting power.
Now under the Takeover code of 1997, as we just discussed and an acquirer was mandated to make an open offer if he alone or through persons acting in concert with him, they were acquiring 15% of more of voting right in the target company.
This threshold of 15% has been increased to 25% under the takeover code 2011.
Now what is meant by acquisition of control? Acquisition of controls substantially differs from acquisition of shares and voting power.
Takeover code mandates making of a public announcement of an open offer for acquisition of control which is done either directly or indirectly over a target company.
This is irrespective of acquisition or holding of shares or voting rights in a target company.
The code of 2011 under regulation 5 gives to us the concept of indirect acquisition of shares of control.
In case of an indirect acquisition of shares or control, the acquisition of shares, voting rights or control over any other company which would enable the acquirer of shares, voting rights or control to exercise such percentage of voting rights which would otherwise have triggered and open of a process and which would enable him to enable the acquirer to exercise control over of a company, then this becomes a kind of indirect acquisition and not a direct acquisition.
Thereby it is meant and thereby it is concluded that even in case of an indirect acquisition he has to follow the open offer process.
The concept of deemed direct acquisitions is a little different from indirect acquisition.
Few or certain indirect acquisition they are regarded as ‘deemed direct acquisition’ or ‘deemed to be direct acquisition’.
If such indirect acquisition satisfies few conditions.
These conditions are that if the proportionate net asset value of the target company as a percentage of the consolidated net asset value of the entity or business being acquired exceeds 80%.
Or the proportional sales turnover of target company as a percentage of the consolidated sales turnover of the entity or business being acquired exceeds 80%.
Or the proportionate market capitalization of the target company as a percentage of the enterprise value for the entity or business being acquired exceeds 80%.
The deemed direct acquisition in all these three cases has the follow the same mandatory open offer process related requirements which are being followed in case of a direct acquisition of shares, direct acquisition of voting rights or direct acquisition of control.
Regulations 6 of the takeover code 2011 makes us understand the concept of voluntary offer.
It provides an option to make a voluntary offer under the Takeover Code of 2011 to those shareholders who already hold at least 25% or more but less than 75% of the shares or voting rights of that company.
The reason is they wish to further consolidate their existing shareholding rights in the company then this option to exercise voluntary offer is given to such shareholders.
Voluntary offer enable such shareholders to acquire further shares representing at least 10% of the total shareholding of the company.
But making a such a voluntary offer is not without restriction.
So, therefore there are certain restrictions to make a voluntary offer for example one is it put some moratorium period.
A person who either individually or together with the persons acting in concert has acquire shares or voting rights of control in the preceding 52 weeks.
Otherwise then pursuant to an open offer is not entitled to make a voluntary offer.
Similarly, during the offer period of such voluntary offer, acquisition of shares in the target company are prohibited.
Another restriction is that the acquirer who makes the voluntary offer is not entitled to acquire any shares of the target company for a period of further six months after the completion of that voluntary offer, except by way of another voluntary offer or a completing offer.
And another restriction is that the shares proposed to be acquired under the voluntary offers should not be in such number so, as to reduce the public shareholding of the target company below the minimum permissible limit assuming that the offer is accepted in full.
Therefore these restrictions have to be followed in case of a voluntary offer and this facilitator provision or option is given to those shareholders who want to further consolidate their shareholding only after they have already made a substantial acquisition of shares or voting rights or control in the target company.
Similarly there is another requirement to be followed under the Takeover code that is what is the offer size.
we have to be aware of this particular fact that all these provisions are given under the Takeover code to make sure that a takeover or an acquisition even if done in a hostile manner or friendly manner is not against the interest of the minority shareholders or investors of target company.
Therefore what should be the offer size and a takeover is provided under regulation 7.
Regulation 7 explains that any acquirer who has already made substantial acquisition of shares or voting rights or control can make an offer for at least 26% of the total shares of the target company within a period of 10th working day from the closure of the tendering period.
Now, what does that mean? It means regulation 7 allows to make an offer size of 26% and the acquirer has already made a substantial acquisition of 25% as allowed by regulations 3.
Therefore under the New Takeover code 2011 an acquirer company in one go can acquire 25 plus 26% that is up to 51% of shareholding or voting power or control in the target company which gives a very broad scope to the acquirer company to acquire shares in the target company.
The voluntary Open offer made through public announcement under regulations 6, it enables the acquirer to acquire at least search number of shares as would entitle him to exercise an additional 10% of the total shares of the target company.
But the post acquisition holding of the acquirer should not exceed the maximum permissible non public shareholding applicable to such target company.
The limitation in terms offer size is not same in case of a competing offer.
If the offer is a competing offer and the acquirer has made a voluntary offer then he is entitled to increase the number of shares within a period of 15 working days to such number as he deems fit.
And after the lapse of these 15 days the acquirer shall not be able to increase the offer size.
Regulation 8 provides us and states as to what should be the offer price and how it should be calculated.
Which again has been stated or mentioned in the interest of the shareholders of the target company.
In case of a direct or indirect acquisition of shares or voting rights or control over the target company the offer price shall be the highest of the following: It shall be the highest negotiated price per share of the target company for any acquisition under the agreement attaching the obligation to make a public announcement of an open offer.
Or the volume weighted average price paid or payable for acquisitions whether by the acquirer or by any person acting in concert with him during the 52 week immediately preceding the date of public announcement.
Or the highest price paid or payable for any acquisition whether by way of acquirer or by any person acting in concert with him during 26 weeks immediately preceding the date of the public announcement.
The volume weighted average market price of such shares for a period of 60 trading days immediately preceding the date of public announcement as traded on the stock exchange, where the maximum volume of trading in the shares of the target company are recorded.
During such period provided such shares are frequently traded where the shares are not frequently traded the price determined by the acquirer and the manager to the open offer taking into account valuation parameters and such other parameters as a customary for valuation of shares of such company.
And the per value computed under sub-regulation 5 file if applicable.
So, therefore whichever is the highest price out of these that shall be the offer price under the takeover code 2011.
Now, what shall be the mode of payment? This again is mentioned under the takeover code under regulation 9.
The mode of payment can be either in cash or by issue exchange of transfer of listed shares and the equity share capital of the acquirer or listed secured debt instruments issued by the acquirer or issue exchange or transfer of convertible debt securities and the code also permits a combination of all these modes.
Now, the code is not without exemptions, there are few categories which are exempted from the regulations, from the procedure mention under the code these gentle exemptions are mentioned under regulation 10.
The first is acquisition pursuant to inter se transfer of shares amongst qualifying persons being immediate relatives persons named as promoters in the shareholding pattern filed by the target company in terms of listing agreement or these regulations for not less than 3 years prior to the proposed acquisition.
another exemptions is a company or its subsidiary, its holding company, other subsidiaries of such holding companies, person holding not less than 50% of the equity shares of such company or other companies in which such persons hold not less than 50% of the equity shares and they subsidiary subject to control over such qualifying persons being exclusively held by the same persons.
The exemption also includes such persons for acting in concert for not less than 3 years prior to the propose acquisition and disclose as such pursue into filings under the listing agreement.
It also applies to shareholders of a target company who have been persons acting in concert for a period of not less than 3 years prior to the propose acquisition and are disclosed as such pursuant to the filing under the listing agreement and any company in which the entire equity share capital is owned by such shareholders in the same proportion as their holdings in the target company without any differential entitlements to exercise voting rights in such company.
Therefore all this together form general exemptions under regulation 10 of the takeover code 2011.
Now after having followed all these provisions with respect to making an open offer or making a public announcement, after having understood that how voluntary offer is made, what is meant by direct and indirect acquisition, what should we offer size and what should be the offer price.
We should also understand that when this process of acquisition should be comply to be should be completed.
Therefore the provisions relating to and the procedure relating to the completion of acquisition is given under regulation 22.
Regulation 22 states that the acquisition process gets complete only after the expiry of the offer period.
The takeover code mandates the opening of an escrow account into which the amount in cash equal to 100% of the consideration as fixed between the parties has to be deposited.
That means that total hundred percent amount in cash has to be deposited into the escrow account.
After the period of 21 working days from the date of detailed public statement that is DPS, the code allows the parties to act upon the agreement and acquire shares or voting rights for control over the target company.
The maximum period for the acquirer to complete acquisition processes is 26 weeks from the expiry of the offer period.
This time period of 26 weeks may be extended by board of directors in case there is an extraordinary circumstance.
And the board of directors before granting such extension would look into the interest of investors in general.
The main issue which arises here is that if once the open offer is made or substantial acquisition offer is made then whether in a acquirer company can be withdraw such an open offer.
So, withdrawal of open offer mentioned under regulation 23 of the code.
There are only certain circumstances under which the open offer can be withdrawn otherwise it is not allowed to withdraw this open offer.
The circumstances are that if the statutory approvals required for open offer or for effecting the acquisition, attracting the obligation to make an open offer under these regulations have been finally refused by the authorities, subjects to such requirements for approval having being specifically disclosed in the detailed public statement and the letter of offer.
Another circumstance can be that the acquirer being a natural person has died.
Another situation to withdraw an open offer may arise wherein any condition stipulated in the agreement for acquisition, attracting the obligation to make the open offer is not met for reasons outside the control of the acquirer.
For such reasons which are outside the reasonable control of the acquirer and such agreement is rescinded, subject to such conditions having being specifically disclosed in the detailed public statement and the letter for offer.
Or another ground can be such circumstances as in the opinion of the board, merit withdrawal.
So, in these cases in these circumstances and open offer Once made can be withdrawn also.
But if the open offer is withdrawn then the acquirer within 2 working days is required to make an announcement in the same newspaper in which the public announcement of the open offer was published.
The code mandates information to be given in writing to the board, to all the stock exchanges on which the shares of the target company are listed and the target company at its registered office.
This is only to make sure that there is enough and there is proper communication done to the investors, to the shareholders, to the board of directors of the target company.
Now, after having discussed and , after knowing all these important provisions relating to takeover procedure, we should also understand as to the what is the role of independent directors under the takeover code.
The Takeover Code of 2011 it makes it mandatory for the board of directors of the target company to constitute a committee of independent directors.
Now these independent directors they are also entitled to seek external professional advice on the same.
So, once this committee of independent directors will be constituted, they have to provide written reason recommendation on such Open offer which the target company is required to publish.
Therefore today we discussed the concept and the meaning of takeover and acquisition.
The difference between these two important terms, they are two important inorganic corporate restructuring activities which companies undertake to acquire shares or stock or voting power or control over the target company.
But because to make sure that this is not done in an arbitrary manner, the code provides set mechanism to be followed to be complied.
It provides various unique features which were not present under the previous code.
Such as, it provides exit option for public shareholders to exit.
it also provides and states, it allows the raising of threshold for making an open offer from 15% to 25% whether it is a direct Open offer or indirect open offer.
And also it gives the revised list of exemptions and many more such unique features are there which were not present earlier.
Therefore it would be right and correct to conclude that Takeover Code 2011 focuses on the principles of corporate democracy, transparency, fairness and it also ensures the interest of investors which is the main, which is the primary objective of the SEBI act.
Thank you.
I am Deepika Prakash from National Law University, Delhi and this presentation is about auditors, their duties and liabilities and the subject of Corporate Law.
This presentation will elaborate on functions of an auditor for representation of true financial status of a company.
The major focus of it is to give an overview of the duties and liabilities of an auditor under the Companies Act, 2013 for the broader objective of corporate governance as a whole.
Now, corporate governance has become the cornerstone of Corporate Law globally.
True and fair audit other co-concerns for regulators world over.
The new Companies Act has made accounts and audit a subject to special interest and has laid down detailed provisions regarding the same.
The Act has also set up a national financial reporting authority for setting the standards for the accounting and auditing.
Now, company carries on its business with the capital provided by the shareholders and other members of the investment community.
It is important for them that their investment is safe and that it has been used for the purpose it was intended to be.
The company has to maintain number of financial books, accounts and statements for the proper accounting of the income and expenditure.
Now, these account books etc must be inspected and verified by an independent person or a firm to give a true picture of the entire financial functioning of the company.
The Institute of Chartered Accountants of India ICAI is a statutory body established under the Chartered Accountants Act of 1949 which regulates the profession of Chartered Accountants in India.
ICAI lays down the pre-qualifications, accounting standards, code of ethics as well as Education of Auditors in India.
Now, only persons who are members of ICAI with a valid certificate of the institute for accounting may be made in auditor of a company in India.
The question that comes before us is what is auditing? The main objective of auditing is to evaluate the financial statements to confirm they are accurate and truly represented in the reports.
In case auditing and accounting is not done soundly or effectively financial scams like, Satyam's happened which adversely affect the investors in the company.
Let us look into the Satyam scandal briefly: Satyam scandal is also called the Indian ENRON.
Sathyam, an IT company ‘One’ the Golden Peacock Award for the best governed company in 2007 as well as in 2009.
It was India's fourth largest company.
Satyam Scandal has turned out to be Nation's biggest corporate scandal.
Now, how was the scandal revealed? On 7th Jan, 2009 the company’s then Chairman and Founder Mr.Ramalinga Raju disclosed in a letter to the Satyam Computer Limited Board of Directors that he had been manipulating the company’s accounting numbers for years.
Mr Raju claimed that he had overstated assets on Satyam’s Balance-Sheet by 1.7 million dollars; nearly 1.4 billion dollars in bank loans and cash the completing claimed were non-existent.
A number of liabilities were also left under reported in the balance sheet.
Satyam income was also overstated almost every quarter for many years.
Mr.Raju and the companies Global Head of internal audit used a number of different techniques to perpetrate the fraud.
Using his personal computer, Mr.Raju created numerous bank statements to advance the fraud.
He falsified the bank accounts to inflate the balance sheets with balances that did not exist.
He also inflated the income statement by claiming interest income from fake bank accounts.
Mr. Raju also revealed that he had created about 6,000 fake salary accounts over the past few years and appropriated the money after the company deposited it.
The company's Global Head of internal audit created fake customer identities IDs and generated fake invoices against the name to inflate revenues.
The Global head of internal audit also was board resolution and illegally obtained loan from the company.
Now, the Founder of Satyam was subsequently arrested after he admitted falsifying the firm’s accounts.
Mr. Ramalinga Raju was charged with several offence including Criminal Conspiracy, Breach of Trust and Forgery.
Satyam share fell to an all-time low in the stock market.
The auditing company Price Water House Coopers audited Satyam book from June, 2000 until discovery of the fraud in the year 2009.
PWC has been severely criticized to give inaccurate and unreliable audit report as well as failure to detect the fraud.
Now, looking at the Satyam scandal, role of an auditor and auditing in corporate governance has become quintessential for the welfare of the company.
They also play a vital role in securing the interest of shareholders and investing communities in India.
For fair and accurate auditing the New Companies Regulation in India which is the Companies Act, 2013 under chapter 10 has brought several changes in the position and responsibility of an auditor in a company functioning in India.
Let us look briefly into this profession: the very first provisions regarding auditors are about appointment.
Section 139 of the companies at lays down that an individual or a firm which includes a Limited Liability Partnership under section 134 ,139(4) and I suppose 141(2) can be appointed as an auditor in a company.
The first auditor of a company is to be appointed at a board meeting within 30 days of registration of the company.
In case the board fails to appoint within 30 days the Auditor then the board will inform the members and the member shall appoint the auditors in the Extraordinary General Meeting of the company.
Every appointment will be for 5 years.
Provided that the company places is the matter relating to such appointments for ratification by members at every Annual General Meeting.
Auditor or Auditing Firms so appointed must give in writing consent on such appointment and certificate for himself or it that the appointment has been made in accordance with the conditions prescribed and the auditor satisfies the criteria provided under the Act.
A notice of disappointment must be filed with the registrar of the companies within 15 days of the meeting which appoints the Auditor.
These were some general rules regarding the appointment of an Auditor in company.
Now, coming to certain additional conditions of appointment under Section 139: Under Section 139 subsection 2 of the appointment revision no listed company or some other company as notified shall appoint as well as re-appoint an individual for more than one term of the five consecutive years or an audit firm for more than two terms of the five consecutive years.
Any audit firm which has a common partner with the audit firm whose tenure has just expired with the company may not be appointed as well.
The companies are required to comply with these requirements within three years of the implementation of the Act, that is from 2013 onwards.
Now let us look at the provisions on rotation of an auditor.
Section 139, subsection 3 says the members of a company may resolve to rotate in the audit firm appointed the auditing partner and his teams.
They may also resolve to get audit conducted by more than one auditor.
The rules regarding the rotation are provided in detail in the companies rules.
Now there are accepted provisions for appointment in case of a government company.
Under sub section 7 of Section 139, in case of a government company or company which is owned or controlled by the central government or State government or by both Central and state government, the first auditor shall be appointed by the Comptroller and Auditor General of India within 60 days of registration of the company .
In case the Comptroller and Auditor General of India does not appoint the first auditor within the 60 days, the board of director shall appoint Auditors within the next 30 days.
In case of failure of the board to appoint the first auditor within this period the members finally shall appoint such auditors within next 60 days.
Sachin appointed auditor which is the first auditor shall hold office until the conclusion of the first Annual General Meeting.
Now under sub-section 5, the auditor of a government company or a company controlled by Central Government or State government or partly by both, the Comptroller and Auditor General of India shall appoint within a period of 180 days from the commencement of financial year to hold office till the Annual General Meeting has concluded.
Therefore this is the entire procedure to be followed for the appointment of an auditor in a government company in India.
Now let us locate the provisions on casual vacancy of an auditor under Section 139, sub Section 8 of the Companies Act 2013.
Now when a casual vacancy arises in a company which is not a government company and if the vacancy is due to resignation of the auditor then the new appointment shall be filed by the board of directors within 30 days.
If the vacancy is due to resignation then the new appointment shall be approved by the company at a General Meeting convened within 3 months of the recommendation of the board and the auditor shall hold the office till the conclusion of the next Annual General Meeting.
Now when a casual vacancy arises in a government company the new appointment has to be made by the Comptroller and Auditor General of India within 30 days.
In case he does not fill the vacancy within the set period, the board of directors shall fill the the vacancy within the next 30 days.
Now there are certain provisions regarding reappointment of a retiring auditor which have been mentioned under section 144 of the Companies Act 2013.
Now subject to subsection 1 of section 140, a retiring auditor may be reappointed at an Annual General Meeting if first is not disqualified for reappointment, second he has not given the company a notice in writing of his unwillingness to be reappointed and third a special resolution has not been passed at the meeting appointing some other auditor or providing expressly that he shall not be appointed.
Under subsection 10 of Section 139 of the Companies Act 2013 where at any Annual General Meeting, no auditor is appointed or reappointed or the existing auditor will then in such a condition will continue to be the auditor of the company.
The Act also lays down appointment in case of an audit committee which has been mentioned under Section 139 subsection 11.
Under it where a company is required to constitute an audit committee.
Under section 177 all appointments including the filling of a casual vacancy of an auditor under this section shall be made after taking into account the recommendations of such committee.
Now let us look at the provisions regarding the removal of an auditor which have been given under section 140 of the Companies Act 2013.
An auditor of a company may be removed before the expiry of his time period only by a special resolution of the company.
This is to be obtained only after the approval of the central government has been taken in the prescribed manner mentioned under the Act itself.
Now what is the procedure when the auditor resigns? In the situation where the auditor has resigned from the company he shall file within a period of 30 days from the date of resignation the following statements depending whether the company is a government company or any other company.
Now coming to a government company, the auditor must file first, a statement is in prescribed form with the company and the registrar and second ,a statement with the Comptroller and Auditor General of India indicating the reasons and other facts as may be relevant with regards to his resignation.
Now what are the statements in case of a company other than Government Company that the auditor has to provide in case he is resigning? The resigning auditor has to firstly submit a statement in the prescribed manner with the company as well as the registrar and the Act actually provides for a penalty of rupees 50,000 in case the auditor does not comply with this procedure.
Now chapter ten also makes a provision for a special notice.
Section 148 provides for the procedure in which a retiring auditor is being reappointed.
When a retiring auditor must not be appointed? If he has completed five consecutive tenures or 10 as the case may be.
A special notice is required to be given on this behalf to reappoint or not to reappoint.
Before a resolution at an Annual General Meeting is taken up on such a matter.
Once the notice is received for resolution the company is to send a copy of the same to the retiring auditor and the retiring auditor under this section will make a written representation to the company which is to be notified to the members of the company as well.
This has to be sent by the company, so as to first state the facts of the representation having been made and second send a copy of the representation to every member of the company to whom notice of this meeting is sent whether before or after the receipt of the representation by the company.
Now in case the copy of representation is received too late or not send in the first place then the auditor will have the right to represent orally or read at the meeting itself.
A copy of the representation has to be filed with the registrar as well.
Now the Act lays down certain disqualifications under the section 141.
It says those people who shall not be eligible for appointment as an auditor of a company are there are number of points mentioned under it.
I will name some of them.
First, a body corporate other than a limited company partnership.
Second, an officer or employee of the company.
Third, a person who is a partner of who is in the employment of the officer of the employee of the company.
Fourth, a person who or his relative or partners first is holding any security of or interest in a second in is indebted to third has given a guarantee or provided any security in connection with the indebtedness of any third person to the company, its subsidiary or its holding or it’s association company or a subsidiary of such holding company.
Fifth, another person who is disqualified is a person or a firm who whether directly or indirectly has business relationship with the company or its subsidiary or its holding associate company or subsidiary of such holding company or associate companies of such nature as may be prescribed by the Act also cannot be appointed.
Sixth, a person whose relative is a director or is in the employment of the company as a director or key managerial person is also disqualified from being appointed as an auditor.
Then a person who is a full time employee elsewhere or a person or a partner of a firm holding appointment as its auditor.
If such person or partner is at the date of such appointment or reappointment holding appointment as auditor of more than 20 companies cannot be appointed as the auditor of the company.
Then a person who has been convicted by a court of an offence involving fraud and the period of 10 years has not elapsed from the date of such conviction is also disqualified and lastly any person whose subsidiary or associate company or any other form of entity is engaged as on the date of appointment in consulting and specialized services as provided under section 144.
Now, Let us look at some of the services under section 144.
They are: Accounting And Bookkeeping Services, Internal Audit, Design and Implementation of any Financial Information System, Actuary Services, Investment Advisory Services, Investment Banking Services, Rendering of Outsources, Financial Services, Management Services and any other kind of services as may be prescribed.
Therefore, we can conclude that these restrictions will prohibit and auditor from rendering certain prescribed non-audit services to the company and its holding a subsidiary company in India.
Now, once the auditor is appointed he has been granted certain powers along with certain duties to carry out.
They can be divided under various heading after analysis of the provisions of the Companies Act 2013.
Let us discuss them: first power is the right to access.
Every auditor of a company shall have a right of access at all times to the books of account and vouchers of the company whether they are kept at the registered office or any other place.
He is under this provision entitled to ask the same from the officers of the company all the information that he considers necessary for the performance of his duty as an auditor.
Section 143(1) A to F lays down the list of matters on which the auditor may seek information.
Right to access is available to an auditor or a holding company of a holding company as well under the following categories: for proper security of loans and advances, transactions by book entries, sale of asset in securities in losses, loan and advances made shown as deposits, personal expenses charged to revenue accounts and and cases where shares allotted for cash.
In all these cases right to access is given to the auditor.
The second is a duty to report; it is a duty of the auditor to make a report on every financial statement which was required by the Companies Act to be laid before the company in the General Meeting.
This report is to be in accordance to the accounting and auditing standards required under the Act.
This report has to be placed very importantly before the members of the company at the end of the financial year.
The report shall state points like, whether he has sought and obtained all the necessary information and explanations which to the best of his knowledge and belief for his audit and if not the details therefore and the effects of such information on the financial statements, then weather in his opinion proper books of accounts as required by law have been kept by the company.
So far as appears from his examination of those books and proper returns adequate for the purpose of is audit having been received from the branch not visited by him and the observations of comments of the auditor on financial transactions or matters which have adverse effect on the functioning of the company.
A more detailed list is given under the act which may be referred.
Another duty of an auditor is to prepare the branch report.
The branch auditor shall also prepare a report on the accounts of the branch examined by him.
This report is to be sent to the auditor of the company who shall deal with it in his report in such manner as he considered it necessary.
Then, one of the major duties of auditor is to conduct audit and prepare the report as per the accounting standards recognized by law.
The central government notifies these standards after consulting with the national financial reporting authority created under the Companies Act, 2013.
Then, there is a duty to report a fraud.
A critical duty under this section is, that has been assigned to the auditor is that whenever during his appointment he has reasons to believe that an offence involving fraud is being committed against the company by its officers or employees he has to immediately report the matter to the Central Government within such time and in such manner as prescribed under the Act.
Sub section 13 elaborates on this duty by adding that an auditor will not be made subject to contraventions of any other duty by reason of his reporting the fraud if it is done by him in good faith.
Then there is another duty which is to sign the audit report.
The auditor has to sign the audit report or sign or certify any other document of the company in accordance with the provisions of sub section 2 of section 141.
Now, all the observations qualifications as well as comments of the auditor on the financial transactions or matters which have adverse effect on the functioning of the company and which have been mentioned by the auditor in his report have to be read before the company in the General Meeting and will be open to inspection by any member of the company.
Then, another right is that of the auditor to attend meetings the auditor under section 146 has to be forwarded all notices regarding the general meetings of the company.
He, unless exempted by the company itself has to himself or through his authorized representation who must be a qualified auditor as well attend the General Meeting and have the right to be heard at such meeting.
Now, coming to the liabilities of an auditor, an auditor in India can be made liable under both civil law and criminal law.
Let us look at both of the liabilities in detail, now, the two actions that can be taken against an auditor under the civil law are: liability for negligence and liability for misfeasance.
Let us look at the negligence first, now an auditor is meant to perform his duty as an agent of the shareholder and other persons who have invested in the company.
He is expected to safeguard the interest of his shareholders.
He must exercise his reasonable care and due diligence in performing his duties.
If he fails to do so and in and in consequence the principal suffers any loss then he may be made liable to compensate loss cost to the company resulting from his negligence.
Now, what about liability for misfeasance? Misfeasance is a breach of duty or breach of trust under the common law and if the auditor does something wrongfully in the performance of his duty or he does not perform his duty properly in the first place resulting in a financial loss to the company he may be liable for misfeasance.
Now, let us move on to the criminal liabilities of an auditor under the Companies Act, 2013.
The first is the penalty for non-compliance.
Under section 147 of the Act, if any provisions stated under Section 139 or 146 are contravened, the company shall be punishable with a fine, which shall not be less than 25,000 but which may extend to rupees 5 lakhs.
Now, the auditor, so convicted, has to refund the remuneration received by him to the company as well as pay damages to the company or bodies or authorities any person for loss arising of any incorrect or misleading statement made by him in the audit report.
Second penalty is for failure to report a fraud.
It is the duty of the auditor under section 143 of the Companies Act (1) 2013 to report any fraud that he has reasons to believe companies officers or employees are committing against the company.
Subsection 15 lays down a fine of not less than 1 lakh which may extend to 25 lakhs, if any auditor Cost Accountant or Company Secretary does not comply with the provisions of sub section 12 regarding reporting of the fraud to the Central Government.
The third liability that is attracted under the Companies Act, 2013 by auditor by an auditor is a liability when the fraud is committed by the auditor himself.
This has been mentioned under section 145 of the Companies Act.
The company law tribunal can either suo moto or on an application made to it by the Central Government or by any other person concerned, if it is satisfied that the auditor of a company has whether directly or indirectly acted in fraudulent manner or abetted or colluded in any fraud by or in relation to the company or its director officers, it may be ordered to direct the company to change its auditor.
Once the order for changing the auditor is passed, the Act does not allowed the auditor whether individual of firm to be eligible to be reappointed as an auditor of any company any company, any company whatsoever for a period of 5 years from the date of passing of this audit report.
Now, once he has been convicted for fraud under section 140 subsection 5 there can be liability that can be attracted under Section 447 of the Companies Act, 2013.
This provision basically acts as a deterrent and preventive measure for auditors to not commit fraud.
Under it a person who has been found guilty of fraud shall be punishable with imprisonment which shall not be less than 6 months and which may extend to ten years.
He shall also be liable to be fined with an amount which shall not be less than the amount involved in the fraud but which may also extend to three times the amount involved in the fraud.
Finally, liabilities of an auditor through class action: under section 245 of the Act, any hundred or more members or deposit holders of the company or 10 percent of the total number of members or deposit holders of the company may file a class action suit to claim damages for compensation or demand any other suitable action against the auditor in the manner prescribed under the Act.
The action under section 245 can be initiated against an auditor for any improper or misleading statement of particular made in the audit report or for any fraudulent, unlawful or wrongful act or conduct.
In such an action liability will be of the order firm.
In case the audit is being conducted by a firm as well as each partner who was involved in making such an improper or misleading report.
Now, auditors form one of the pillars of corporate governance.
The auditor is responsible for verifying whether the financial statements and books of accounts exhibit a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the business.
His audit report has to be authentic and accurate.
In this module we saw, how an auditor is appointed, his qualifications, his disqualifications, tenure as well as perks and duties and liabilities which have been made under the Companies Act, 2013.
The new companies at has bought in several changes the reporting responsibilities of the auditor have under it significantly increased.
This step has been taken in order to protect the shareholder and the other investors in the company.
Therefore, auditors play a very important role in the company and protect the interest of the shareholders.
Thank you!
Hello, I am Feroze M A Khan.
I am a Professor Teaching Company Law and financing fortunately international business ,New Delhi.
Today, I will introduce you this audit and auditors under Companies Act 2013.
So besides, I will tell you the rules and regulations.
I will also tell you about integrating that regulations with the practical aspects ok.
So just you give you overview .
Chapter 10 of the Companies Act, 2013 under Section 139 to 148 deals with audit and auditors .
So, just to tell you the basic premise on which this audit and auditors are very much depending on.
So, accounts as you know accounts when you say annual accounts these are the very reliable financial statements.
Say statement of profit and loss or which you earlier we are saying profit and loss account.
Next is the balance sheet.
Next is the cash flow statement and besides other things notes to accounts and other things.
These accounts are prepared by the board of directors.
Now, these accounts when it is completed or it is accounts are completed so these have to handover to the shareholders.
Because they are going to look at how the company has manage the how that board of directors manage the company in the last 1 year.
And similarly, when the company has been manage properly.
When the company has got a profit .
So, now the company will declared dividend.
So, several sir looking forward to also the rate of dividend declared by the board of directors.
But that before the accounts are handed over though it is complete , but before it is handed over now the auditors role come into picture.
because everything when they are accounts when you say every thing is done by the company, the board of directors now it has to be waited (1:48).
It has to be verified.
It has to be audited by 1 external agency so that's why the auditor have to come into picture.
Otherwise the shareholder, they will not be relying the statements profit and the financial statement prepared by the company.
So just to ensure that the financial statement reflect to and fair view of the financial position or the net reasons of the company so the auditors play very vital role .
So, shareholders are going to realize that accounts only when it has been audit by the auditors.
Now, based on the report because when they are checking the accounts, when they are auditing the accounts.
The auditors so definitely they will come out with lot of .
The comments sometimes the comments can also be the adverse comments.
So, if it is adverse comment definitely the board of directors , they have to replay board of directors.
They have to reply to the comments so along with the comments given by the auditors plus the classifications given by the board of directors.
Now, with accounts will also be submitted together to the shareholders as per there information.
That's why in the annual report we find the beside the profit and loss account and balance sheet carry also a auditors reports.
So, now you understand that accounts are subject of Criticism the investors are looking forward to take a understanding of the profit, the company has made.
And investors, the good investors also look forward as to how the company is managing the affairs of the company.
So, how the company investing? So, ultimately future outcome also they are looking forward.
Besides the profit, they also look forward the company is going to be better and better in future to come.
So, lots of things are definitely connected.
Lots of stakeholders are connected.
It's not simply the shareholders.
It is also in the bankers, the creditors were connected even the employees, even the unions, even the government, even Income Tax Department.
What not so lot of stakeholders are connected to the company.
And so they all look forward to have a proper understanding of the accounts and finance statement.
So, they are understanding gets you know better when they see that the accounts has been audited by the auditors.
So that’s why the role of auditors comes.
if some of you can say, it, bridges the gap between the company management on one side and the several says the other side .
Now before I take you to the dipper of the rules and regulations and further integrations.
Let me tell you what is the learning outcome this module .
So, if you read this, if you watch this the video definitely you are going to relate the relevant provisions of Section 139 to 148.
So, Section 139 to Section 148 of the Companies act, 2013 to further developing and appropriate system for audit of the accounts and financial system in the company.
So, these sections are definitely going to be a kind of base.
It will create a base for developing a proper system of audit of accounts and financial system.
Similarly as we know there is a audit committee.
As you know, there is a audit committee.
In every company, the audit committee comprises the members.
Sorry, it comprises the directors of the board.
And as we also know that most of the directors, audit committee should be of the independent directors or non independent directors.
So, now audit committee is very instrumental in connecting with the auditor's and audit work .
So, audit committees are going to recommend the auditor's who are to be appointed as auditors and who are the form or the individual going to be appointed as auditors.
Similarly they are going to review also the findings of the auditors.
Even they are going to look at any loopholes or fraud or any mismanagement which is pointed out by the auditor.
So, definitely another learning outcome is there.
After watching this video , understanding the rules and regulations definitely you will be able to develop a proper understanding as to how the audit committee and the accounts department in one hand gets I mean the co-ordinate with the auditor.
So, there are 2 sides.
One is the say audit committee and accounts department the other side is audit and auditors .
So, how there is a proper conditions being maintained looking into not to forget this aspect that section 139 to 148 of the Companies Act to be complied .
So, majorly this to the outcome one is to this we can relate the sections in understanding whatever the system existing the company whether the system appropriate or not.
Second thing will also develop or understanding as to proper codeines between audit committee and accounts department.
one hand and Audit and auditors on the other hand .
Now let me quickly (6:47) talk about which are the sections, what he talks about? Section 139 deals with the appointment of auditor, section 140 talks about removal, regulations of auditor and also relates to giving up special notice.
Section 141 explains the criteria of eligibility, qualification, disqualification of auditor.
Section 142 talks about remuneration of the auditor.
Then section 143 explains power and duties.
Section 144 expects auditor not to render certain services.
Section 145 deals with provisions for signing auditor’s report.
Section 146 deals with provisions relating to auditors attending annual general meeting.
Section 147 prescribes punishments for contravention.
So the above sections from section 139 to 146 and last section is section 148 that speaks about the cost audit .
So, I will while I am talking separately each and every sections, I also tell about the analysis of that section .
So, section 139 says that subject to provision of this the companies act.
I means this chapter .
Every company sell at the first Annual General Meeting.
Appoint an individual or a form as an auditor who shall hold office from the conclusion of that meeting in the conclusion of it’s sixth annual meeting.
And thereafter till the conclusion of every 6 meeting .
And the manner and procedures of selection of auditors by the members of the company at such meeting shall be search as may be prescribed.
Similarly this section also says that no listed company or a company belonging to such class or classes of company as may be prescribed shall appoint or re-appoint.
( A) An individual as auditor for more than 1 term of 5 consecutive years and (B) An audit from as auditor for more than 2 terms of 5 consecutive years.
Now this is broadly the section talks about the appointment of the auditor but if you analysis this section definitely there are lots of finer things.
The provisions might effectely protect the nature of the auditor for 5 years.
Now coming to section 140 that talks about removal, resignation of the auditor.
So this section says that the auditor appointed under section 139 may be remove from his office before the expiry of his term only by special resolution of the company.
After opting the previous approval of the central government in that we have in the prescribed manner.
Now if you analyse this section as we understood special resolution in the companies meeting is required.
And also the approval from the central government before above reasonable opportunity of being heard should be given to the auditor.
The auditor should file report in the prescribed manner to ROC.
And the company his reasons of resignation within 30 days of resignation should be file with the ROC.
Special notice su should be required for passing reasons to not to appoint the retiring auditor.
Now, let us look at the next section that is section 141 that talks about eligibility qualification of the auditor.
Section 141 says that a person shall be eligible for appointment.
As an auditor of a company only if he is a Chartered Accountant.
Provided that the form majority of the partners practicing in India are qualified for appointment as aforesaid may be appointed at bites form name to be auditor of a company.
Section 141, further says that where a form including limited liability partnership is appointed as an auditor company, only the partners where Chartered Accountants shall be authorized to act and sign on behalf of the form.
Now let us look at the analysis of this section.
Now it is good to see that introduction of LLP that is Limited Liability Partnership as auditor and partners not having even the chartered accountant or CA degree even are allowed to work with CA .
This is similar to what has been seen as International practice.
Now, there are some terms which are being used in this section which are little subject to be better and which are suppose to be understood properly.
The terms like business relationship has given in the act as additional disqualifications request a good clarity.
Similarly other there are it is to be understood as to what constitute a business relationship whether routine business transactions at an arm's length (2:04) or even immaterial transactions.
It’s not clear as to whether a personal form an guest in providing non audit services is disqualified to be auditor of any company.
Or in that company only to unclear (2:17) services provided that doesn’t say anything else to nature of the size of the companies while resting the number of bodies to 20 companies ,.
Let us look at the next section that is 142 so that relates to remuneration of the auditor.
So, this section explain that the remuneration of the auditor of the company shall be fixed in its General Meeting or in such manner as may be determined there in.
Provided that the board may fix remuneration of the first auditor appointed by it.
This section also further says that remuneration under remuneration shall in addition to the fee payable to an auditor include the expenses.
If any inker by the auditor in connection with the audit of the company and any facility extended to him but doesn't include any revolution paid to him for any other services rendered by him at the request of the company, .
Now ,suppose you start analysing the section 142.
So, it is found that this is a big issue that why remuneration to be decided in the general meeting for all auditors except in the case of first auditor.
This is definitely a big question .
And coming to the next that is Section 144.
It says that an auditor appointed under this act shall not provide certain services.
The services are are which the auditor should not provide to the company in which he is auditing.
The accounting and bookkeeping services the internal audit, design and implementation of any financial information systems, actuary services, investment advisory services, investment banking services, rendering of outsourced financial services, management services and any other kind of services which may be prescribed.
Now, if you analysis this particular section 144 definitely people will talk about this point that there are certain non audit services which might not pose risk to the Independence.
But the way such services have been listed and define it appears that as if almost all the non audit services are risk to independence of the auditors which is dividable.
Such prescribed prohibitive practices are not at the best practices.
Now coming to Section 145 which relates to auditors to sign the auditor's report .
That explains that the person appointed as an auditor of the company sell signed the auditor's report or sign or certify any another document of the company in accordance with the provisions of these section.
And the qualifications, the observations comments of analyses transactions or mattress which have any adverse effect on the functioning of the company mentioned in the auditor's report shall be read before the company in the general meeting.
And shall be open to inspection by the members of the company .
This is very good I mean development that whatever the auditors comment that has to be read in the meeting.
So earlier the it was being only circulated .
now it has been definitely emphasize that the report should be read in the meeting.
So any adverse coming with the auditors with the functioning of the company shall be read in the of the general meeting for information of all the members this a good development.
Now coming to Section 146, which says that all notices of and other communication relating to any General Meeting shall be forwarded to the auditor of the company .
And the auditor shall unless otherwise exempted by the company at and either by himself or through his authorize representative who shall also be qualified to an auditor .
Surely, it will make the shareholder happy.
So I personally believe that this is a good development .
And this is going to really improve the ethical fabric of the company.
Now section 147 that talks about the punishment for contravening the afore said sections which what we discuss.
Now section 147 explains that if any of the provisions of Section 139 to 146 if these sections are not complied the company shall be punishable with fine which shall not be less than 25000 rupees.
But which may extend to be 5 lacks of rupees.
And every officer of the company which in default shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 1 year or with fine which shall not less than 10000 rupees.
But which may extend to be 100000 rupees or with both.
Now section 147 further says about the response of the auditor that even auditor of a company contravenes any of the provisions of Section 139 or section 143 or section 144 or 145, the auditor shall be punishable with fine which shall not be less than 25000 rupees.
But which may extend to 5,00,000 rupees.
1 interesting difference between the earlier companies act 1956 and the new Companies Act 2013 definitely as it is understood it is experience that the amount of punishment or the severity it has increase.
Perhaps it has going to really I mean curtail the wrong practices by the both the company and also the auditor.
Now there are certain terms which are definitely properly understood.
The terms like intention to receive any other persons Consultant or interested in the company.
So, these terms are very much confusing those even the words like in proper or misleading statement of particulars.
Even further likely act so these terms are the very much confusing.
Similarly so more terms are wrongful act or conductor that appears very much unclear (10:26) and would create difficulties in interpretation.
Given the unlimited liability inflecting open the auditor, the same year result in adverse impact and may give rise to disputes and conflicts.
There can be few situations when the form can be held liable for the fault of partner which is not at per the better international practices.
The provisions of the class action by the minority shareholders would bring even auditor per into per view besides you know advisors and experts against sooms action can be initiated.
Experts believe that this provision might be misused .
Now if you look at the analyses of these section definitely this section section 147 needs to be properly understood with regard to of lot of terms which are being used.
This is really needs to be properly understood .
Similarly sometimes if the auditor can go against the spirit and may report also certain very small small minor things which is again going to create confusion.
So as we understand lot of things are going to further come because of you know the elaboration has not been made in new active in.
#Course Name: Corporate LawHello dear students!
I am Anil Kumar Rai, Professor at National Law University, Delhi.
I will be dealing with the Governance Structure of Companies and this module I will briefly deal with that what are the important aspects of the governance structure with regard to the governance structure of the companies.
So when we look to the governance structure of the companies two important aspects have to be taken into account.
One is that there is a divergence in ownership of an asset and control over it and the second aspect is that legal personality is being imputed to an artificial entity.
Divergence, Now, we have to understand that whenever there is a divergence and ownership of an asset and control over it then duties will have to be imputed on the person who is in control of the asset.
Law implies that the person who is in control over the asset has owes certain duties to the person who really owns the asset in law or in equity.
So, let us take for example, the property which is held in trust, the trustee who is in control of the asset owes duties to the beneficial owner of that particular asset.
Similarly, in the law of agency the agent concerned owes duty to his principal.
In a partnership, the person concerned though its the entire partnership which is in control of the asset .
But if a partner is dealing on behalf of the asset on behalf of the partnership the asset then the concerned partner will in that particular circumstance has a certain duty to the rest of the partners.
Now, the duties can be increased or decreased by contract .
So, you can increase the duty you can decrease the duty.
Many times when the duties are provided whatever is imputed by law this is implied part of the relationship between the parties.
But, by contract duties can be reduced and in many circumstances the duties are reduced to such an extent by contract that the party concerned virtually has no duty.
This might be of some concern in certain circumstances and we will come to it later on.
Now, the second aspect which we have to take into account is that legal personality when it is given to an artificial entity.
The statute granting that particular personality will provide for rules of ascription.
The rules are a necessary part of granting of a personality because here we are dealing with an artificial entity.
When we are dealing with an artificial entity there has to be something which will say that in what circumstances the artificial entity has entered into a contract.
In what circumstances it is this it can a certain decision because unless we have rules of ascription then we will not be certain that whether the entity concern has taken a decision or it has not taken a decision or it has entered into a contract or it has not entered into a contract because whatever is unfavorable to it those who are benefiting from that entity will back out from it.
Now, we have different circumstances by which a personality can be created.
One particular circumstance is what personality is created by law.
The statute creates a personality examples of this are where weak personalities, local bodies, universities, statutory corporations.
Now, when the personal this personalities are created by the statute the statute will provide which organs of that particular body will take a decision ,which organs of that particular body will take a decision in a particular field.
What shall be the composition of the different organs? What shall be the powers of those different organs? the conflict between different organs of that legal person shall be resolved.
The extent of their powers.
Now, in another way it can also provide; first, these are the broad norms which the statute lay down, then it can lay down not just the broad norms but it will also take into account the fact that the statute cannot anticipate all the circumstances and it will not be appropriate for the statue to cover everything in detail.
So, delegated legislation can be provided for in those circumstances and statue will lay down the norms for delegated legislation.
#Course Name: Corporate LawNow, when an artificial person comes into existence under statute, like: cooperates and companies we have to understand that this is a situation which is different from the first situation which I refer to earlier. in the first situation which are referred to earlier, the purpose for which the concerned statutory corporation or body came into existence was a defined purpose.
Here, the purpose will never be a defined purpose.
It can be many purposes all of which can never be enumerated in the statue concern.
Second thing is that there are the members or can be specified it can be laid down in greater detail how the concerned body can be governed.
This is a situation which is different there has to be a certain degree of flexibility which has to be given in this situation rather than laying down in detail how these bodies can, how these artificial persons should govern them but themselves.
But, something has to be specified by the statute.
First of all it has to specify the provisions it has to specify in what situations recognition should be given to the board, the concerned artificial entity.
So, it will lay down, how the artificial and what should be satisfied when the artificial entity comes into existence.
There has to be specified in with the great degree of detail and certainty.
Second it has to provide for oversight by the authorities when it has laid down the situations when the in which the artificial entity comes into existence.
It has also to look specified for oversight by the authorities.
Statutory corporation is a different thing compared in that particular situation.
It is answerable to the government, it is answerable to the law Codes for the performance of its duties.
But here, most of the times the concerned Cooperative or the company is not answerable to the government, it's not answerable to the Law Codes.
It has a purpose purpose it has to fulfill and it is answerable only to the man powers.
The third of type of a situation which this statute has to provide for is it has to recognize the different interest which are there in that particular entity and how to reconcile the different interests or a mechanism by which the different interest should be reconciled.
Now, what are the main interests which have to be reconciled in a company? The first interest which needs to be reconciled in a company is that of the shareholders vis-a-vis the creditors.
The shareholders are the risk takers.
The creditors have to be paid-back.
But the creditors would have greater interest in the paying back of that their money then the shareholders have ,who have got a limited liability if the company fails.
The second type of interest which has to be reconciled.
The second type of situation where the recognition of interest has to be done is where one class of interest of one class of shareholders vis-a-vis the interest of another class of shareholders.
The different classes of shareholders will have interest which clash with each other and the company has to reconcile those interest.
the different class of shareholders will not be only with regard to shareholders which have one type of rights but shareholders who because of their situation in that particular company have a different by themselves are a different class.
When they derived right through the articles of association there was an opportunity which was provided to them to protect their rights and many a times in the private company ,the shareholder does have a role in the management and since it has a role in the management, he can look into that particular companies management more carefully than a normal person.
Sorry! Since, the shareholder has a role in the management he is in the know what the company is doing and how it will affect his interests.
On the other hand we take into account a listed public company.
Listed public company is at the other end of the spectrum.
The shareholder has not negotiated the articles of association in a listed public company.
Since, he has not negotiated the articles of association usually in a listed public company, the shareholder concern does not have an opportunity to take measures to protect his rights from that of of the majority.
He does not have a role in the management so there is a minimum knowledge which he has how the companies is working and how it will affect his interest? Now, these two factors: the fact you have that in a private company the shareholder has the role in the management.
While in a list listed public company the shareholder does not have a management role has not had taken any measures so as to control so as to protect his own rights.
Therefore, the scope of rights which are being given to a shareholder in a private limited company and in a listed public company will be different.
In a private limited company the statute takes into account that the shareholder has an opportunity to protect his natures.
While in a listed public company that particular opportunity is usually not available since it is usually not available the statute as to step-in and provide for it.
Now, in a similar way in, we have to look into the distinction between the different class of the rights of a different class of shareholders.
In a public company you have 2 classes of shareholders and equity and preference shareholders.
Of course there can be classes within the preference shareholder, different classes of preference shareholder but they are a class by themselves.
Now, between the equity and preference shareholder we have to take into account that the preference shareholder has got a preferential right of dividend, secondly he has also that got a preferential right of return of capital.
And since his capital is not at risk therefore it is the equity shareholder who ought to be given a greater say in the affairs of the company than the preference shareholder because the equity shareholder takes the maximum risk in the success or failure of the company.
Now, it is an artificial person and it has to act through the natural person.
Now, can it at through the natural person that is the shareholder.
Theoretically, there is no prohibition in doing it but then the advantage of having a company is taken away.
One of the purposes of having a company is that the shareholder can be separated from the date today, affairs of the company and its management can be given to a professional body which will manage the day to day affairs of the company.
The so in this way it the company is different from the partnership.
Now, the company has to act through a natural person.
Who will have been charged of the day today affairs of that particular company? That particular body which is in charge of the day-to-day affairs of the company are the directors and the body of directors is the board of directors.
They are selected by the shareholders as per the Companies Act and articles of association.
Now, though they have been selected by the shareholders they are represent the company and not the shareholders.
This is an important distinction which we have to take into account that they represent the interest of the company and not of the shareholders.
The implications of this particular distinction are that in certain circumstances for the interest of the company they can take decisions which might not be in the interest of the shareholders as such.
Now, what is the relationship between the shareholders the board of directors and the company? The shareholders and the board of directors are two organs of the company.
They speak for the company and they act for the company.
The distributions of powers are dependent upon the Companies Act and articles of association.
First, let us look into what are the powers which are vested in the shareholders? What are their rights and of the shareholders? That can be three sets of rights which are vested in the shareholders.
One it is provided to them by the Companies Act.
Second set is that which has been reserved for them by the articles of association.
The third side relates to those with the shareholders by voting have reserved from themselves.
The reason is obvious.
The shareholder never had the opportunity to provide for rights to himself in articles of association to protect himself from the majority decision.
Rights which have been reserved for the shareholders will relate to different types of situations.
So, first type is where it relate to the oversight by the shareholder of the Board.
So, approving the accounts of the company deciding of the auditors of the company.
These are the methods by which the shareholder overseas the board of directors.
What it is doing? How it is affecting its interests? So, these rights have to be reserved in favor of the shareholders.
Second type of situation laid to where there can be a conflict of interest between the board and the interest of the company.
So, oversight has to be given to the shareholder in such situation.
So, in such situations the shareholder will have to decide whether it .
second type of a situation related to where there might be a conflict of interest between that of the company and that of the board of directors that for example; the related party transactions.
In related party transactions the shareholder has to be given an opportunity to decide whether the transaction has to be entered into or not because the decision of the board cannot be relied upon.
The third type of a situation where the shareholder has to be given power is leads to where he has to be made aware of the nature of risk and its implications.
Take for example; the sale of an undertaking.
Merger of a company with another company, these are situations which will have implications on the value of the share and it has a bearing on the risk with the company which the undertaking will be subject to.
Then, there are rights and powers which are reserved by the shareholders for themselves in the articles of association of the company.
Now, the shareholders may reserve additional decision making powers for themselves in the articles of association.
They might also while reserving for rights for themselves provide for stiffer norms by which one can say that the shareholders have approved a particular action and they might provide also for special powers to one of the shareholders or a body of the shareholders.
As far as the powers which are given to the board are concerned those powers my proof certain sets of powers will flow from the Companies Act.
The reason why certain sets of powers will flow from the Companies Act is because the Companies Act recognises that in certain situations the duties of the board might be in conflict with the interest of the shareholders.
So, in a situation where the duties of the board matter in conflict with the interest of the shareholders the powers have to be given to the board.
So that they override the shareholders in that situation then powers might be given to the board or to a committee of the board by the articles of association of the company.
And lastly, shareholders might delegate certain powers to the board by voting.
Now, powers given to the board by articles, as we know the articles of association is a contractual document among the shareholders.
Since, it’s a contractual document among the shareholders.
Therefore what the powers which have been given to the board are something which is binding not only just upon the board but it is binding upon the shareholders too.
The shareholders cannot take away from the board of directors that which has been given by them to it without amending the articles even though the shareholders as a body might differ from the board by majority large enough to amend the articles.
But, till they have amended the articles it is the board which shell exercise that particular power.
Now, also one have factor we have to take into account that shareholder does not mean just the majority of the shareholders.
It means all the shareholders and some of the shareholders might differ from the decision of the majority.
Also certain rights might be given to the minority shareholders and those rights cannot be taken away by the majority of the shareholders.
So, if the board of directors decision is subject to the view of one particular shareholder, the concerned if one board of directors view is subject to so, if the board of directors decision is subject to the view of one director nominated by a particular shareholder.
It cannot be that the shareholders as a body can override that particular view of the board of directors because this is a right which has been given to a particular shareholder.
The majority if at the initial stage has reserve the right for one individual shareholder or his or one individual shareholder or a director nominated by him then the majority cannot take it away without amending the articles.
Another aspect which we have to also to take into account is that if the power has been given to the board of directors then that another aspect which we have to take into account that is that the articles of association is a public document.
The public is aware of the decision making structure of the company through this particular document.
So, if the shareholders seek to impose their view upon the view of the board of directors then there would be confusion in the public concern.
Now, decision making by the shareholders is usually by an Annual General Meeting or an Extraordinary General Meeting.
Annual General Meeting has to be as the word itself suggests has to be called annually and it will deal with the housekeeping functions like – approval of accounts, etc.
Extraordinary General Meeting is something as the very name suggests is something which will be called in extraordinary circumstances.
It is either the board of directors, the Tribunal or a certain percentage of the members, who will request the board of directors to call for a meeting and the board of directors then will call for that particular meeting.
As per the Companies Act it is 10 percent of the members who can call for an Extraordinary General Meeting.
What is a meeting? Meeting has two elements.
First is, exchange of views amongst the members and determination of majority amongst the members.
For an exchange of views there has to be for exchange of views the members have to be told insufficient detail all the aspects of a particular case and they have to be told sufficiently in advance for them to be able to form the minimum number of members which will be required for a meeting to occur will be two because there cannot be an exchange of you and the determination of majority and unless there are two members who are present.
So, if it is not a single person company for a meeting the minimum quorum requirement will be two.
But the quorum requirements will go up as the number of members of a company increase under Companies Act depending upon the number of members of a company the quorum requirements increase.
Quorum requirements can also be provided for in the articles of association of the company.
It can provide for more stringent quorum requirements then what it is provided for in the Companies Act.
Now, if the members meet and they are in agreement with a particular action which has to be taken or particular step which has to be resolved then they will pass a resolution.
The resolution can be passed by show of hands or by voting.
Voting can be either physical or in case of public limited companies it can also be by postal ballot.
The postal ballot becomes necessary because many times the the people who take a decision in a company are the minority.
It gives the majority, a view into the decision making because physical presence is usually very difficult for most of the people.
Value of vote which is caste will be dependent upon whether it's a public company or it is a private company.
In a public company each equity share will have the same vote as another equity share.
But in a private company different shares can have different weight as far as their voting rights goes.
It can be possible that one share as far is voting has got the twice the value as another share or it can be any multiple which we can think of.
Now, the resolution which is passed by the company can be a general resolution or a specialist resolution.
A general resolution is where an ordinary majority is required but in certain situations special resolution might be required.
The Companies Act provides for certain situations where special resolution is required.
Generally, they can be classified in three types: first is that which relate to the contractual relationship among the shareholders.
Articles of association and memorandum of association should be amended only if three fourth of the majority of the shareholders present and voting vote for it.
Second type of his situation laids to those which have the potential to affect the shareholder value, so in cases where at new shares have to be issued in a public limited company in the case of merger of companies, sale of an undertaking or the company making investment above a particular limit or giving guarantees extra above a particular limit of the share of shareholders funds should have the backing of three fourth of the majority of shareholders.
For the actions which have which have to be reserved for the shareholder but many times the board might have over stepped into what was reserved by the shareholders for themselves? In such a situations the shareholders also can ratify the actions of the board.
Provided it was within their powers to ratify.
One question which usually arises is – is a formal resolution always necessary for us to know that whether the whether the company has decided on a particular course of action? It’s not so but it's not so only if we we but it’s not so only if we can say with a certainty that there was an informal unanimous agreement among the shareholders and this informal unanimous agreement amongst all the shareholders should be evidenced by conduct by the shareholders.
Normally, for the passage of a resolution it is the equity shareholders who vote.
It’s their vote which is taken into account but we have to take into account that preference shareholders are excluded from voting only because that they are not at risk.
It means that the company is in financial trouble.
Once the company is in financial trouble then it's not the equity shareholders who are also interested in it, it’s also the creditors and the preference shareholders.
The creditors in any way are protected by statue.
In a financially troubled company the preference shareholders will lose and lose as much as the equity shareholders.
Another situation which we have to take into account is that where it concerns the rights and duties of a class of securities.
The members of that where it concerns the rights and duties of a class of securities it is the owners of those securities who should vote on it.
So, where it relates to the rights and duties of a class of securities as resolution has to be passed by three fourth holders of that particular class of securities and it affects any other class of securities then that resolution also has to be passed by the affected class of securities.
let us come to delisting of securities.
When we say we have listed our securities ,we have entered into an agreement with this stock exchange.
And the stock exchange will provide the facility for trading of securities on the stock exchange.
When we say delist that means now we are cancelling this agreement of listing.
So that further after that agreement is cancelled no trading facility will be provided to the those particular securities which have been delisted.
delisting can be of 2 types.
It can be a voluntary delisting and compulsory delisting.
And voluntary delisting ,when the company itself makes an application for the delisting of the securities then it is voluntary delisting.
And if it is compulsory delisting , then the stock exchange takes a decision for delisting of the securities.
voluntary is dependent upon the need of the company.
The reasons are with the company.
Compulsory delisting, the reasons are given by the delisting regulations.
And these are the reasons for which the stock exchange can go ahead with the delisting of the securities.
And there is a requirement of continuous listing under rule 19 A of the companies of SCR regulations.
And 1 has to understand over here that when it is delisting it does not mean that it is buyback of securities.
Buyback of securities is done by the company.
But in the case of delisting of securities, promoters buy these securities .
that is why the promoters they have to give their money, use their money for delisting of securities.
And delisting means now the securities will not be available in the trading platform.
The shareholders may want to exit the company because they had invested in the company to earn certain returns through the trading of the securities.
And if the trading is not possible on nationwide terminals then obviously they may would like to exit the company.
Over here 1 has to make understand that there is a difference between delisting and buy back of securities.
Let us understand about conditions of delisting.
Delisting is not permitted in certain cases.
For example, if it is pursuant to buy back of equity shares , if the company has got back securities they cannot be delisted.
They have to be extinguished as per the provisions of the Companies Act applicable to buy back of securities.
Then if a company makes the preferential allotment of securities then it cannot go ahead with the listing of those securities.
Then if securities are listed at least for a period of 3 years before that they cannot be delisted.
a minimum listing should be there for 3 years before the company goes and with the delisting of securities.
And if any convertible instruments are outstanding at the time of the delisting.
And these convertible instruments, they are convertible into the same type of securities which are proposed to be delisted then the company should not go head or rather company cannot go head with the delisting of these securities.
these are the 4 conditions or exemptions where the delisting is not possible.
And the promoters as i discussed earlier they cannot use the funds of the company for the purposes of the delisting.
And in order to provide exit opportunity to the shareholders, they have to use their own funds.
And promoters or any other person is restricted.
They are not allowed to employ any device or artifice or scheme or make any kind of transaction which operates as fraud on the shareholders.
Or which is fraudulent, manipulative or deceptive.
These are 2 conditions which the promoters have to keep in mind.
Let us understand what is voluntary delisting? As I told you, that the company itself decides to volunteer delist its securities.
The reasons can be like company does not want to further go ahead with the statutory compliance, the company has been losing on the trading of securities, company has suspended its business, company has become a sick company, it is restructuring itself, it is going at reorganization of it’s share capital.
Then the company may go ahead with voluntary delisting.
Obviously the regulations cannot provide the reasons for the delisting but if the delisting has to be done the procedure is provided by the regulation.
What is exit opportunity and when it has to be given? Exit opportunity is given to the shareholders when the securities, when those are shares are being delisted from the securities.
And they are delisted from the nationwide terminals like NSE or BSE.
If they are available on regional terminal but not on the nation wide terminal, then the promoters they have to give this exit opportunity to the shareholder.
That since from now onwards after the delisting trading facility will not be available.
In case you want to take back your money, we can pay you and we can take back your shares.
And the shares are taken back or bought back by the promoters for the shake of delisting.
exit opportunity is the opportunity given to the shareholders to exit the company.
And sell their shares back to the promoters of the company.
exit opportunity is necessary only when the nationwide trading facility is not available otherwise it is not compulsory for a company to give exit opportunities.
And for delisting also the promoters, they have to taken in principle approval from the stock exchange.
And for this purpose ,the reverse book building process supplies over here.
And What is Reverse book building? The promoters, they come up with offer of delisting and they ask the shareholders of the company that at what price they are willing to sell their securities to the promoters of the company.
a prices fixed and then a final price is fixed on the basis of the revese book building process.
On the basis of the floor price multiplied by number of securities the similar securities outstanding in the market that amount is calculated.
And the promoter has to keep that amount in the escrow account which will be used for the purposes of paying back at the time of exit opportunity to the shareholders.
The final price is decided on the basis of the reverse book building.
When the book closes, final price is decided.
Whatever is the balance required promoter has to provide the deficiency of the amount in the escrow account.
Let us now understand what is compulsory delisting.
Compulsory delisting is done by the stock exchanges.
The reasons are given under the regulation.
The first reason is that the company has incurred losses for preceding 3 consecutive years and has a negative network.
Second, there has been a suspension of trading in securities for more than 6 months.
Third, there has been infrequent trading of securities during the preceding last 3 years.
this is the fourth ground.
Fifth ground is that the addresses of the company or any of its promoters or directors are not known or the false addresses are given or the company has changed its registered office without information to the stock exchange.
And the company's public shareholding has gone below the minimum level which is required and company has not been able to raise it within the prescribed time limit.
And these are the grounds on the basis of which the compulsory delisting can be ordered by any stock exchange.
Obviously, an opportunity of hearing has to be given to the stock exchange before finalizing the decision on this.
And the decision of delisting is to be taken by a panel which is constituted by the stock exchange as it is prescribed under the regulations.
And public announcement of the delisting has to be made by the company.
And the price of the securities at which the exit opportunity will be given to the shareholders, that price has to be decided by the independent valuer.
And who will be deciding upon the determining the fair value of the delisted equity shares.
there are certain special provisions.
I will read these special provisions for you.
In the case of a small company having a paid up capital of up to 1 crore with no trading of its equity shares in 1year, immediately preceding the date of the decision of delisting.
Or the company has 300 or less number of public shareholders and the paid up value of shares held by them is less than 1 crore.
The company is not required to follow the procedure given for exit opportunities.
these are the special provisions for the delisting of securities.
Let us now take an example of Trichy Distilleries and Chemicals Limited.
This case was decided in 2011.
in this case the issue was that whether 90% of the shareholders in number or shareholders holding 90% of the public shareholding in value irrespective of their number should consent for the delisting proposal.
Whether they should be shareholders 90 in numbers or shareholders irrespective of their number.
If they are holding 90% of the shareholding of the company, they should be entitled to vote for the delisting proposal.
In this case the company was able to get consent of more than 90% of the shareholders in value but the number of shareholders giving consent did not add up to 90% of the public shareholder.
the Madras Stock Exchange refused to go head with delisting.
To approve the delisting by the company.
it was decided later on when the case went into dispute that if we go by the provisions of the companies act which says that 1 share is equal to one vote.
This means that it would lead to absurdities if the consent of 90% public shareholders in value was not accepted.
this was a case which was decided by the in the year 2011 over here there have been number of statements which have been made publicly in the newspapers now a days about delisting of regulations.
And there should be review of the delisting regulations because some of the companies are finding the process to be very cumbersome and lot of efforts have to be made by the company.
review of the delisting regulations has been proposed.
And the SEBI also wants to restrict the delisting procedures with the possibilities of manipulation in the case of delisting is avoided because delisting is totally in the hands of the promoters of the companies.
In order to have any kind of tacit understanding between promoters and if you share holders where the price manipulation of the securities can be The SEBI is under reviewing under this review of delisting regulations.
And the major changes which are being discussed are that we should reduce the time period of delisting which is given for 250 days because this is a too long a period because there are chances of price manipulations of this stock.
There can be a manipulations of the prices by the non-promoter group.
There is suspension of trading after the announcement of delisting so 250 days are a long period for that.
And some times demand of the securities is also less.
The Discussion paper was proposed by SEBI for reviewing delisting regulations.
They are working on this and although the revised regulations have not been imposed so far .
They have not been enforce so far.
of the under the review or the discussion paper, the process of reverse book building the time which is taken and informal arrangements which have to be made the procedure should be made a little simple for the companies for delisting of securities.
all these issues are under discussion with the SEBI.
Let us now take few examples of a delisting.
Then the first public announcement was made on May 16, 2014 and it was in respect of the proposed acquisition and voluntary delisting of fully paid up equity shares of the company from the Bombay Stock exchange, Madhya Pradesh stock exchange and NSC .
And later of offer was issued on may 20th to the shareholders for inviting bids from all the public shareholders.
And post offer public announcement was made on June 26.
you see that first of all an announcement is made, public announcement is made and offer letter is sent to the prospective shareholders.
Then the second public announcement is also made after the book building process is complete.
Then in another case, in the case of Piramal Glass Limited, public shareholders they were informed through the public announcement on July 22nd 2014 by Kotak Mahindra capital company limited.
On behalf of Shri Hari Trust which acted through its corporate trusty PEL Management Services Private Limited about the proposed acquisition and voluntary delisting of fully paid up equity shares of rupees 10 Each of the company vide public announcement which was made on April 25th 2014.
Acquirer head fixed the exit price of rupees 140 Per share which was calculated by the reverse book building process as we discussed.
All shareholders who tendered their shares through valid bids at or below the final price they were paid accordingly.
Promoters group shareholding increase to 90.85% after the acquisition.
And the company applied for delisting to NSE and BSE.
And the company had made an offer to residual shareholders to tender their shares at the same terms and conditions.
Over here you see that promoter shareholding increase to 90.85% after this delisting.
And we know that promoters cannot have more than 75% of the shareholdings.
After delisting they have again to reduce their shareholding to meet the norms.
While riding this module certain changes were proposed in the delisting regulations by amendment of 2015 and in these amendments, I will consider only the major amendments which have been proposed in these regulation.
First amendment which is very important is to know is what are the conditions for delisting? 1 more condition has been added for delisting.
And the regulations says the delisting is not permitted pursuant to buy back of equity shares or a preferential allotment made by a company or unless the specified securities have been listed for a period of 3 years on the stock exchange.
If any convertible instrument issued by the company are outstanding and they are convertible into same class of equity shares that are sought to be listed.
The new condition which has been added is that the delisting is not permitted, if any entity belonging to promoter or promoter group has sold equity shares of the company during a period of 6 months prior to the date of board meeting approving the delisting proposal.
Another change which has been made is about the exit opportunity and the procedure for the exit opportunities.
where in the case of voluntary delisting exit opportunities required to be given.
This proposal has to be approved by the board of directors of the company.
And public notice should be given and the application to the concerned recognized stock exchange for delisting of equity shares should also be given.
The board of directors has to approve and they have to make a disclosure to the concerned recognized stock exchange.
Appoint a merchant banker to carry out the due diligence process.
And obtain trading details of shares of the company of top 20 shareholders of the company for a period of 2 years prior to the date of the board meeting when they are working on approval or the approval of the resolution for the proposal of delisting.
Then the board has to certify that the company is in compliance with the applicable provisions of securities, laws and conditions for delisting.
As well as the delisting is in the interest of the shareholders of the company.
these are 3 changes which are made in the case of voluntary delisting where exit opportunities required to be given.
Another major change is about when an offer is deemed to be successful.
in 2009 regulations ,an offer was deemed to be successful.
If post offer is shareholding of the promoter taken together with the shares accepted through eligible bits at the final price reaches the higher of 90% of the total issued shares of that class excluding the shares which are held by a custodian.
And against which depository receipts have been issued overseas.
Or the aggregate percentage of the pre offer promoter shareholding and 50% of the offer size.
so the shares will be accepted only when the final price reaches the higher of the 2.
In 2015, amendment an offer shall be deemed to be successful only if the post of a promoter shareholding taken together which share accepted through eligible bids at the final price richest 90% of the total issued shares of that class.
And at least 25% of public shareholders holding shares in the Deemed mode as on the date of the board meeting have participated in the book building process.
you see that these conditions now they have been made more strict depending upon the promoter shareholding as well as the participation of the public share holders in the delisting process.
these are the changes which are proposed by the new amendment which is made in 2015.
Good morning I am Dr.Harpreet Kaur Professor of law at National Law University Delhi.
Today I will be dealing with corporate borrowings and investments, which will give an inside to the students as to what are corporate borrowings? What do we mean by corporate borrowings and how investments are done by the companies? I would be referring only to the provisions of the Companies Act for this purpose.
I will not be going into the types of borrowings which are governed by RBI, so I will be focusing only on the Companies Act 2013 provisions.
Now, 2013 act has made certain changes in the procedure, how a company can go ahead with the investment.
So we will take into account all these changes which are made by the Companies Act 2013.
Now first of all over here it necessary for us to understand that a company which is into a trading business or which is conducting a business has to , meet its requirements either through the share capital or it can also raise a debt.
Now a trading company has an implied power to borrow, whereas a company which is not into trading activities does not have this implied power so that there should be specific power given in the memorandum of association of the company that it has the power to borrow money for the purposes of the company.
Now if a company is collecting debt from the public that it has to do it through the issue of debt securities and when these are debt securities again the debt securities have to be listed and all the formalities relating to listing of debt securities have to be complied with by the company.
A company can also go ahead with long term loans from the financial institutions and commercial banks and in order to meet the short term needs of the finance the company is generally used method like a trade credit factoring, discounting of bills of exchange, bank overdrafts and cash credit.
ECBs are also methods which can be used by the companies for borrowing, and they are primarily cross-border debts which are raised by the company’s, Indian companies from overseas lenders with a weighted average maturity period of not less than 3 years and such borrowings are governed by RBI regulations and Foreign Exchange Management Act of 1999.
Now, it is a necessary for us to understand that a company has to make a financial analysis and it has to decide about the method of a fundraising, whether it should go with the raising of share capital, whether it should go with the borrowings, what is the interest rate at which the borrowings are applicable whether the lenders are available in the market or not, what is the investors’ confidence on its debt securities and what are the differential interest rates from the banks and the bonds, all this analysis has to be done by the company before it decides to go ahead with raising of debts through the issue of debt securities.
And investments they are also provided by the Companies Act of 2013.
So let's take the current borrowings, how many borrowings have been done by the Indian companies.
So in 2013 Indian companies they raise around 3.10 crore rupees through the borrowing and they preferred to meet, the companies preferred to meet their financial needs for the debt rather than through the issue of securities in the form of initial or further public offering and the companies they preferred the private placement of bonds and non-convertible debentures to meet their need.
Now this is the very important aspect over here, that companies were not sure whether the investors are willing to invest as a shareholders in the form of IPU or FPOs with them.
And they were able to find lenders of money which were, who were there willing to lend money to them and again when the companies decided to have debt raised from the lenders, they also preferred to go for private placement of bonds rather than the issue of public issue of debt securities.
And they also preferred for non convertible debentures that means these differences are not convertible into shares later on.
So, this indicates the sentiment of the of the market and on the basis of this, the companies they make their choices, what method they should adopt for borrowing debt from the market.
And so within the debt market are the figures are like this: If company raised about to 2.
65 lakh crores with the debt placement route 23,745 crore through non convertible debentures and 19,650 crores with the public issue of debt securities.
So over here we see that a maximum is through the debt placement route.
The second category is non-convertible debentures and third is issue of a debt securities.
Now let us understand what is ultra vires borrowing? Ultra vires means beyond the powers of the company.
So anything which is done beyond the powers of the company becomes ultra-vires and it is ultra vires borrowing, that means the borrowing has been beyond the powers of the company.
So any borrowing which is neither expressly nor impliedly is permitted that will be termed as ultra vires borrowing because it is beyond the powers of the company.
Now the question arises what are the rights of the person whose loan has become ultra vires.
Does he have any legal debt against the company or any equitable debt against the company? No he does not have such any right against the company, but he can get an injunction to restrain the company from using the money which has been lent by him, if the company has so far not used this company.
So this remedy he can, this relief he can take in the form of injunction, if he knows he comes to know that the money has not been used by the company.
Then if his money has been used by the company to pay off any lawful debt then also he can subrogate to the position of the lawful creditor of the company and then his money can be repaid by the company to such an extent he will have the right of recovery from the of the money from the company which has been lent by him to the company.
And at the third point, if he can identify and trace his loan in the original form in the original form or the products which have been brought up by the company and which are there in the position of the company, he can claim this money or he can also claim for the products from the company.
But if his money gets mixed up with the capital of the company, he loses all such rights of, when his borrowing has become ultra vires the company.
Now let us understand what is regular borrowing or what is authorized borrowing.
So any borrowing which is exercise which is done by the board of directors of the company that will become the regular borrowing.
And under section 179 of the Companies Act 2013 the board of directors of a company, they have the power to borrow money for the purposes of the company.
Now the ratios have been fixed over here.
Certain restrictions have been placed by this by section 180 it says that where the money borrowed together with the money which is already borrowed by the company will exceed aggregate of its paid-up share capital and free reserves, apart from the temporary loans which are obtained by the company from the company's bankers in the ordinary course of the business.
It can borrow money with consent of the company by a special resolution.
So this has to be kept in mind that where the money exceeds that the new loan exceeds the total aggregate of the paid-up capital plus free reserves and the special resolution of the company has to be followed has to be passed for the for further borrowing.
And what are temporary loans? The temporary loans are loans which are repayable on demand or within 6 months from the date of the loan for example short term loans, cash credit arrangements, discounting of bills and the issue of other short term loans of a seasonal character and they do not include loans which are raised for the purpose of financial expenditure of a capital nature.
So this is in brief about the regular borrowings of the company.
Now there are certain exceptions to section 186.
The exceptions says that they are not, these provisions are not applicable to a loan made or guarantee given or a security provided by a banking insurance or housing finance company in the ordinary course of its business or a company which is engaged in the financing of companies are providing infrastructural facilities because this is the ordinary business of such type of companies.
It does not apply to any acquisition made by non banking financial company, register under RBI and whose principal business acquisition of securities and exemption will be available only for its investment and learning activities and also by to any acquisition which is made by a company whose principal business is the acquisition of securities or it will also not apply to any acquisition of shares which are allotted under section 62 of the Companies Act 2013.
So these are certain exceptions which are given under the section.
Let us now understand section 187 of the Companies Act 2013, which is about investment of companies to be held in the names of the companies.
And this is perfectly acceptable proposition that all the investment done by the company should be in the names of the companies only because these are the investments of the companies only in the case of holding and subsidiary relationship, whereas holding companies, holding shares in the subsidiary company then the company can have shares in the names of its normally because the minimum shareholding number of the shareholders have to be maintained.
And I hope you understand that what is meant by holding and subsidiary relationship this is a relationship between two companies where one company is exercising control over the other company by means of either having more than 251 % of the shareholding in the other company or by controlling composition of board of directors of the other company.
So, the relationship of holding and subsidiary company comes into being, also if a one subsidiary company or another company is another company.
For example if S is subsidiary of A and A becomes a subsidiary of H then both A and S will become the subsidiaries of H.
So these are three methods, either through the method of the composition of the board of director or through the share maximum 51% of the shareholding of the company or through the third means, these are the three means through which the three methods through which a company can have a holding subsidiary apart from this a company for the purposes of collection of dividend of the interest may hold its securities or or investments with SBI or any other scheduled commercial bank for the purposes of facilitating the collection of dividend and the interest.
And it can also transfer it to the SBI or any scheduled commercial bank.
It can hold it in the name of the SBI or any other scheduled bank but where after the transfer in it if within 6 months the transaction is not completed then the retransfer of the securities are done in the name of the company itself.
This has to be kept into mind and also the companies can also transfer their securities for the repayment of the loan as a security to any other person and then can get it back to them in their own names when they have re-paid the loan.
So these documents were the instruments can be used by the company as a security for the loan also they can also be transferred to SBI or other scheduled commercial bank for the purposes of collection of dividend and the interest.
And the company has to maintain a register for it, otherwise it becomes very difficult for a company to know how many investment it has made and what investment are in the name of any other scheduled commercial bank or they are given as a security to any other person.
So a proper register has to be maintained by a company under section 187 in order to give a clear picture about the investments done by the company.
Let us now take certain examples first example which I will take is of Tata steel.
This is about issue of non convertible debentures.
So , we understand what are debentures, when we say they are non-convertible that means they cannot be converted into shares later on.
So they have to be redeemed.
That means the repayment has to be made by the company to the debenture holders.
So these were 2% non convertible debentures that means the coupon rate or the interest was 2% and the yearly yield to maturity was 9.
80% and the total amount which was made by the Tata Steel was about 1500 crores.
And these were issued at the discount on the face value of 15%.
So that means if one debenture was of hundred rupees, 15% 15% discount was offered on the face value of hundred rupees.
So this discount will make the, after this discount the value of the the face value will be 85% for the debenture holders.
So the issue was done by the company in 2012 April and the maturity date was 22 April that means the term was of 10 years and after 10 years they are compulsorily redeemable debentures.
As I told you that coupon rate was of 2% interest and this was annually payable and the rating was double A plus by care and break wares.
Now it is over here a very much necessary for you to understand that before a company goes ahead with the issue of any types of debt securities whether debts or bonds.
It is compulsory to have a rating from the companies which are into rating.
so that the investors when they are investing they come to know that what rating has been given by the company, so that becomes important for the credit worthiness of the company which is taking the loan from the company.
Let us now take another example of Tata Power, the Tata Power had launched perpetual debentures.
Now what are perpetual debentures, as we have already discussed that perpetual debentures, which are not redeemable that means the debenture holders will be the creditors for lifelong to the company and Tata Power we know it is India's largest integrated private power utility.
It launched the offering of perpetual debentures of 1500 rupees crore and they had the joint lead arrangers or the banker's for this issue were Standard Chartered Bank and Yes Bank.
So as per the debt securities, issue of debt securities regulations there should be a lead merchant banker also who should assess the company in taking the due diligence for the issue of these securities and these debentures who are perpetual in nature.
So there was no maturity of the redemption and they were callable only at the option of the company and the coupon rate which was set up on the debentures was 11.
And these debentures they rank senior only to the share capital of the company and this provided equity characteristics to these hybrid debentures.
And also what are the compliances, how many registers have to be maintained by the company, what are the purposes for which the investment instruments of the company can be used by the company.
So all this gives you an information on the and give provides one inside on the corporate borrowings and investments.
Thank you very much.
we also need to understand what is price sensitive information? Under 1992 regulations, price sensitive information means any information which is directly or indirectly related to a company.
And which, if published is likely to materially affect the prices of the securities of a company.
And certain informations are deemed to be price sensitive information.
For example, periodical financial results of the company, intended declaration of dividends of the company, whether interim or final dividend.
Issue of securities on buyback of securities any major expansion plans of the company or execution of new projects of the company, amalgamations, mergers or acquisitions or takeovers of the company.
Disposal of the whole or substantial undertaking or the part of the undertaking of the company.
Any other significant changes in the policies or plans or operations of the company.
All these were deemed to be price sensitive information under 1992 regulations.
Let's have a look at unpublished price sensitive information under 2015 regulations Over here before understanding this price sensitive information ,we need to understand what is generally available information.
Because on the basis of generally available information, the definition of unpublished price sensitive information or UPSI has been given by the 2015 regulation.
generally available information means information that is accessible to public on a non discriminatory basis.
On the basis of this let us understand what is unpublished price sensitive information? And it means any information again relating to a company or to it’s securities whether directly or indirectly.
And the information which is not generally available which upon becoming generally available is likely to materially affect the price of the securities.
And it shall ordinarily include the following but is not limited .
There are also being the unpublished price sensitive informations in this case also which are which are financial results ,dividends, change in the capital structure of the company ,mergers ,demergers ,acquisitions ,amalgamations, listings, de-listings ,disposals, expansion of the business.
And such other transactions changes in the key managerial personnel and material events in accordance with the listing agreement.
you see that here we have 2 more categories where we are talking about changes in the material in the managerial personnel as well as changes in the material events in accordance with the listing agreement.
Over here we have expanded again the scope of deemed unpublished price sensitive information over 1992 regulations.
Both the regulations they had instructed that there should be code of internal procedure and conduct.
In 1992 regulations, the company had to make a code of internal procedures and conduct which should be followed by the company and its employees while dealing with the un-published price sensitive information.
2015 regulations talk about 2 types of codes.
First is the code of procedure and practice which says that, a board of directors of a listed company has to formulate and publish a code of procedures and practices for fair disclosure of unpublished price sensitive information.
And these procedures have to be followed by persons who are engaged in or who are having access to unpublished price sensitive information .
The second point says that a board of directors of any company or any intermediary or the any prson who is connected during that operations of the company, business operations of the company has an access to the unpublished price sensitive information.
He has to formulate and also publish code of conduct for the regulation, monitoring as well as reporting of the trading of its employees as well as have a look into the compliance of the provisions.
And for this purposes of that they are also mandated to appoint a compliance officer .
this provision has been stringent not only for the company, but also for the intermediaries and other persons who are associated with the company.
there were certain disclosures which are required under 1992 regulations.
under 1992 regulations, 3 types of disclosure were required of by any person who was holding more than 5% shares or voting rights.
Then the 2nd category of directors and officers of the listed company.
And the third category of disclosures were required by any person, who is part of the promoter group or he is a promoter himself.
Let us look at the first category of disclosure.
He has to disclose to the company within 2 days of having acquiring these voting rights of the shares And he is also under the responsibility of continual disclosure .
So let's first start with alteration of capital.
We know that it is not necessary for a company to get incorporated with capital but if any company has to do any business its needs a share capitals.
So therefore most of the companies they get incorporated with a share capital.
And the memorandum of every company it has a clause which is known as capital clause which gives the information about the capital which a company can rays which is known as a authorized capital.
So if any alteration is done to the capital.
What do we mean by alteration? If any modification of change is done to the share capital of the company that is covered by alteration of capital under section 61 of the Companies Act, 2013.
Now let us look in the ways in which a company can alter its capital.
First of all it can increase its authorized capital or as per the amount which is required.
The question is why a company decides to increase its share capital? What is the reason behind that?A company may by expanding its business or it may be diversifying its business.
So that is why companies is in need of further capital.
So the company can go ahead with further issue of capital which means that the company has increased its capital.
So the company when increase its capital that is the change in the share capital of the company which is known as the increase in the capital of the company.
The other type of change which can be made by the company is that reduction of the share capital.
When the company reduces its share capital again the reason for the reduction of the share capital is also in the hands of the company.
Companies act is silent about it but how the process has to be followed, which process has to be followed, how the capital can be reduced by the company that is given by the companies act.
Now why a company would go ahead with reduction of it's share capital? One of the reasons can be that companies having excess capital.
So the company does not want to incur any burden of paying dividend to the shareholders because it is not using that excess capitals, so it decides to pay of the excess capital to the shareholders that results in reduction of the share capital.
So the other form of alteration of capital can be that company consolidates it's share capital and it again it divides that into shares of a higher amount or a larger amount than the existing shares of the company.
For example let's say a company is having a share capital of 10,000 rupees which is divided into shares 1000 shares or 10,000 shares of rupees one each.
Company consolidates that 10,000 and re divides that into shares of rupees 10 face value.
So the number of shares will be reduced because now the shareholding the face value or the nominal value of the shares has increased to rupees 10.
So accordingly the number of shares will be reduced.
So over here that what the company has to keep in mind is that the whatever are the rights or the voting percentage of the shareholders that voting percentage of the existing shareholders should not changed because of this alteration.
So the proportion of the voting percentage should remain the same even if when the companies consolidating its shares and converting them or dividing them into shares of a larger amount.
Another thing which a company can do is that it can convert it's share capital into stock and then re convert this talk back into the share capital.
Now what is the need of a company to convert it's share capital into stock and what is a stock? Let’s say that companies having a share capital of 10,000 rupees which is divided into 1000 shares.
The company consolidates all those shares into one and the stock is worth 10,000 rupees.
So it is not divided into shares.
So when the share capital is in lumpsum but it is not divided into shares then it is known as stock.
So the company will go for conversion into stock only when all the shares are fully paid up shares.
And company knows that how many shareholders are there and how many of them are having, what is the percentage of share holding that they are having, what are their voting rights, what are their dividend rights.
So that when they are converted into stock their rights remain the same.
There is no loss or no loss occurs to the shareholders when such type of conversion takes place.
And when company finds it convenient it can convert stock back into the shares also.
After that another way is that that company subdivides its existing shares into shares of smaller amounts which is also known as talks split or shares split.
Where a share having a face value one share of face value rupees 10 is subdivided, let say into 2 shares of rupees 5 each or 10 shares of rupees 1 each.
So this is how the conversion is made then also on this it has to be seen that when such type of a conversion is there whatever is the proportion of the amount which has already been paid up on the shares and whatever is the balance amount which is unpaid that proportion shall remain the same in the case of the stock split or share split.
Then if the company had decided to offer the shares but the shares have not been taken up by the person who had agreed to take those shares and companies not in a position to issue those shares then company can cancel that share capital that will also lead to the reduction of the share capital.
Now in such a case when although it seems to be reduction of the share capital but it is not taken as a reduction of share capital because these shares was not issued by the company.
So these are the methods these are the five methods through which a company can alter its a capital.
And so the face need is felt by the company to alter its share capital companies act silent about the reasons for alteration of capital.
Now let us discuss further issue of capital or which is also known as further public offering or which is also known as in FPO in abbreviation.
This is covered by section 62 of the Companies Act of 2013.
Now when a company goes ahead with further issue of capital there are certain requirements which are given by section 62 that first of all this further issue of capital should be offered to these persons who are listed under Section 62.
Now Companies Act, 1956 had dealt with this under section 81 and it is also known as the rights issue because first of all this offer has to be given to the existing shareholders of the company.
And they get this right under their pre emptive rights because they are existing shareholders ofthe company.
So that is why this issue is also known as rights issues because they are getting this offer of further issue of capital by the company because they are having the pre emptive rights as existing shareholders of the company.
Now how the rights issue have to be given.
In such a case an offer letter is made by the company and this offer letter gives the number of the shares which are offered to the existing shareholders in the form of rights issue.
The time period is also given to them which would be not less than 15 days.
But we should not be more than 30 days within which they have to accept these offers.
This offer or they can reject this offer, they can decline to accept these right shares.
Another important thing over there is that that these rights, these existing shareholders they are also given the right to renounce these shares in favour of any other person.
So they can renounce any part of this shares which are offer to them or the full number of shares can be renounce in favour of any other person.
So this is what is known as rights issue.
in case the 30 days passed and the shareholder, existing shareholders does not like to take these shares then these shares they go back in the possession of the board of directors.
And then they issue those shares they dispose off these those shares as they find it necessary.
not giving any loss to the company for this issue and also not to the shareholders.
So this issue of shares if the rights shareholders rights issue if it is not accepted by the existing shareholders then the board of directors they can issue these shares or dispose off these shares in a manner, we should not be disadvantages to the company as well as to the shareholders of the company.
Then the second persons which fall in this list is that these shares should be offered to the employees under the scheme of employee stock option.
And for this purpose the company has to pass a special resolution then the shares will be offered to the employees under the ESOs.
The third category is of any person if has been authorized by the special resolution of the company.
Now these a persons may fall in above two categories that is maybe existing shareholders of the company or they may be employees of the company or they may not be they may not fall within these two above stated categories.
And these shares can be issued for a cash or for a consideration other than a cash and the price of the issue of these shares has to be determined by a registered valuer and he has to submit valuation report on the basis of this valuation report the price of issue of such shares is decided.
Now after the company has gone ahead with the further issue of capital, after the process comes to an end within 30 days, this has to be notified by the company to the registrar of companies.
Now section 62 under subsection 4 has a very important provision which deals with power to convert loans into capital.
Then it can direct the company to do so.
Over here the terms and conditions of such conversion have to be decided and it is not necessary that the company has to accept this offer, company has the right to give its opinion on this that whether it agrees for such type of conversion or not.
And it is also not necessary that this option of converting debentures or loans into shares of the company should be at the time of issue of these debentures or taking of loan by the company.
So this can be later on consider in public Interest by the government that these shares, these debentures and loans they should be converted into shares of the company.
And so if the company wants to appeal it can go to National Company Law Tribunal and appeal it to the tribunal within 60 days of such order of conversion.
Now as of now National Company Law Tribunal has not been established, so all such powers are exercised by company law board which was earlier working under the Companies Act 1956.
So till the time NCLT get establish, this power will remain vested with the company law board only.
And again this has to be notified to the ROC.
next comes the bonus shares, under section 63 of the Companies Act, 2013 as the bonus shares as the name indicates they are given free.
So bonus shares they are actually an accretion to the share capital and they given free of cost to the existing shareholders.
So the funds which can be used by the companies for issuing such bonus shares can be the free reserves of the company, it can be the amount which is lying in the securities premium account or it can be the capital redemption reserve.
So these are the three funds or reserve which can be used by the company for issuing bonus shares.
And why a company wants to issue bonus shares? Because company has profits in its within its profit and loss account and company is in need of shares, so its a need of increasing the share capital.
So instead of going ahead with the further issue of capital, company issues unissued shares of the company to the existing shareholders.
So that there is the process of capitalisation of profit takes place and those unissued shares or the profit of the company they get converted into shares of the company.
Now sometimes this question arises that when there are reserved which are created from revaluation of the assets, can they be that reserve be used for the issue of bonus shares? No it cannot be used.
Any type of reserve which is created by revaluation of the assets, this amount cannot be used by the company in issuing a bonus shares to the shareholders.
Bonus shares also cannot be given in lieu of dividend.
This has to be kept in mind.
First of all that company should be authorised by its articles to issue bonus shares and resolution should be passed for issue of bonus shares and if the company has defaulted in payment ofany interest or any principal debt or any fixed deposit or debt securities of the company, company cannot go ahead with the issue of bonus shares.
And also if there are outstanding partly paid up shares of the company then those are partly paid up shares should be converted into, they should be made fully paid up only then the company can go ahead with the issue of bonus shares.
Next is reduction of share capital.
A company act does not want any company to reduce its share capital because this is the fundamental capital with, this is the most important requirement of the company or the amount which has to be maintained, whose santity has to be maintained by the company.
So the companies act says that we won't permit you to reduce the share capital unless and until you do it as per the procedure which is given by the companies act.
And why the company wants to reduce its share capital? As we have already discussed that depends upon the need of the company.
Reduction of share capital is dealt by section 66 of the Companies Act, 2013.
Under 1956 Act there was sections 101 to 104 which delt with the reduction of the share capital.
Now which type of a company can go ahead with reduction of the share capital? A company which is limited by shares, so it is having a share capital.
Any guarantee company which is having a share capital can also by passing its special resolution, can go for the reduction of the share capital.
Now how reduction of share capital has to be done? company can extinguish or reduce the liability of on any of the shares in respect of the share capital which has not been paid which has not been paid.
For example if a company has issued shares with the face value of rupees 10 and the premium payable is 490 rupees.
So the total for 1 share, a shareholder has to pay 500 rupees.
Now in such a situation if at the time of offer for the subscription of securities if the company has asked for 50% of the amount as application and allotment money, 50% of the amount has to be is kept in the balance to be called at the time of, through the times, through the means of calls being raised by board of directors.
In such a situation a shareholder has a paid 250 rupees per share and 250 rupees has been kept in the balance.
Now if a company wants to reduce its share capital what it can do, it can extinguish 250 rupees, it can make this 500 rupees share with the face value of 500 rupees can be converted as a fully paid up share of rupees 250.
So the shareholder is not required to pay extra 250 rupees now.
So that amount has been reduced.
So the share capital reduces by 50% of amount of the per share which the company wanted to raise.
So this is one of the methods through which a company can reduce and then the second point says that either with or without following this extinguishment or the reduction of the liability a company can cancel any paid up share capital which is lost or which is not represented by the available assets of the company.
When a company says that it has a share capital of 1 crore, it should have assets which should be worth 1 crore.
Now if the actual assets with the company are let say only 90 lakh rupees and the company is showing its share capital to be 1 crore that means company has lost 10 lakh rupees from its share capital or it is not available represented by the available assets.
This is the time when the company has to reduce its share capital to give to indicate it's a real work that it's share capital is actually 90 lacs but not 1 crore rupees.
And similarly the second requirement will be that if the company is having excess of the share capital beyond its needs.
So if the company has raised capital which the company not able to use it right now, so company can repay that to the shareholders and reduce its share capital because company will haveto incur additional burden of dividend payment on the shares which on the share capital which the company is not using currently.
So these are the ways in which a company can go ahead with reduction of the share capital.
Now what are the requirement for this, that company will not be allowed to reduce it share capital if it is in arrears of repayment.
This is what has to be seen that if the company has defaulted or the arrears of interest or the principal amount or the deposits has to be paid and company has not paid them.
The company will not be allowed to go ahead with the reduction of share capital and before reduction of share capital company has to propose a scheme to the National Company Law Tribunal or the company law board and seeks its approval before such type of a conversion.
And what tribunal has to take into account or the company law board has to do? It has to forward this scheme to the central government.
if the company is listed then it has to be sent to the SEBI also, otherwise it has to be sent to ROC and also the creditors of the company that tribunal ask for their representation after considering all their representation then the tribunal decides whether it should approve this scheme of reduction of share capital or it should reject the scheme.
Now let us discuss section 67 of the Companies Act, 2013 which says that there is a restriction on the company on purchasing its own share capital not share capital but purchasing its own shares or if the company wants to give loans to anyone to purchase its own shares that restriction is contained in section 67 of the Companies Act 2013.
Now what is meant by purchase by company of its own shares? Its a company is issuing coming up with the public issue of let say 1,000 crores and company is buying its own shares from the public issue worth 1,000 let say 100 crores.
So the company has to reduce it share capital because it is using its own money to purchase his own shares.
So accordingly there should be consequent reduction of the share capital because the ultimately company has been able to raise only 1,000 crore minus 100 crores.
So that reduction has to be done.
This is what is the restriction given under section 67, it says that a company is restricted to purchase its own shares but if it purchases its own share there should be consequent reduction of the share capital.
And no companies allowed to give any financial assistance to any person to purchase its own shares or it should not give any kind of loan, it should not give any kind of financial assistance, it should not give any kind of guarantee or otherwise help any person in purchasing shares of its own.
but there are certain exceptions to this, where these restrictions do not apply.
For example in the case of a banking company, if a banking company in the ordinary course of business is giving loan and the person is using loan to buy any public issue given by that banking company only.
So then it is buying the shares of the banking company but we need to understand this exception willnot, this restriction will not be applicable to this banking company because this is the ordinary business of the banking company to give loan to the the public for any reason whatever they have in their mind.
So their restrictions will not applied in the case of a banking company.
Next is about where the company is providing money to the employees for purchase of shares of its employees or where the employees they or the shares to be later on distributed by the employees they are kept with the trustees of the company.
So if the company is providing money for purchase or subscription of fully paid up shares of the company or its holding company if the shares are held by the trustee for the benefit of the employees or such shares are held by the employees of the company then such restriction will not be applicable.
Then company can also land money to its employees to buy the shares of the company or its holding company.
But the restriction is over here is that employees they will not include the directors or key managerial personnel of the company and the amount of loan should not exceed a six times six months of their wages or the salary.
That means for a period of six month whatever salary or wages they are getting, this amount should not be more than that amount.
So over here there another restriction is that employees do not include directors of the company or they do not include the key managerial personnel of the company.
Lets come to very important aspect of alteration of share capital which is in the form of buyback of shares.
Now buyback of shares is dealt by section 68 of the Companies Act, 2013.
When we say buyback that means company has issued first companies have issued those shares now they are buying back from the existing shareholders or they are buying back from the open market.
Now what is the fund and what is the need for buyback?Now the need is against felt by the company may be companies having surplus funds so that is why it want to give some kind of bonus to shareholders it is giving them more money at the time of buying back the offer ahhh is giving the shareholders more money in comparison to the current market price of the existing shares or the company wants to wind up any of the business, it wants to end any business of the company is having too much of shareholder, too many shareholders ,now it wants to reduce its share capital, wants to reduce the number of shareholders.
So that the dividend requirement is less or there may be tax related purposes for which the company wants to go ahead with the buyback of shares.
So companies act again is silent about the reasons for the buyback of shares.
But the procedure is given by the Companies Act, under section 68.
Now the fund which can be used for the purpose of buyback of shares includes again the free reserves, securities premium account of the company or the proceeds of issue of any shares or other securities which are offered by the company.
So free reserves, securities premium account or if the company had come up with any offer of initials or other securities that amount can be used by the company those proceeds can be used by the company for buyback of shares.
Now the restriction is that if the company has earlier issued any shares so from the proceeds of the earlier issue the same type of securities cannot be brought back.
this has to be seen that it says that no buyback of any kind of shares or other securities is allowed from earlier issue of the same kind of shares or same kind of other specified security.
Now there are certain conditions which are required to be complied with by the company before it goes ahead with buyback of shares.
First of all it should be authorized by the articles of the company to buy back its shares.
Then a special resolution should be passed by the company in the general meeting.
And where the buyback is less than 10% or less than 10% of up to 10% or less than 10% of the total equity share capital of the company.
In such a situation there is no requirement of the special resolution provided that the board of directors pass the resolution for the buyback of the of the shares.
And buy back should not be 25% or buyback should be 20% or less of the aggregate of the paid up capital and free reserves of the company, this is the third requirement.
It should be at least it should be 20% or less of the aggregate of the paid up capital and free reserves of the company.
And after that the ratio of the aggregate of secured and unsecured a debts owed by the company after buyback should not be more than twice the paid-up capital and its free reserve.
Yes higher ratio can also be provided by the central government later on but so far it is that it should not be twice the amount of paid up capital and the free reserves.
And all the shares which are under the scheme of buying back they should be fully paid up and if the shares they should also comply with the SEBI regulations.
Because SEBI has also given regulations for buyback of securities so those regulations have also to be complied with.
Where SEBI regulations are not applicable in such a situation the rules which are frame by the companies act those rules have to be followed by the company before it goes for the buyback of shares.
And the next condition says that buyback should not be made within a period of one year from the date of closure of the preceding buyback offer if company had made any.
So if the company they cannot be two consecutive buyback without a gap of one year between these two buybacks.
Now a notice has to be given to the shareholders because a resolution has to be passed which is a special resolution.
So notice has to be given to the shareholders and there should be an explanatory statement given to the notice that the company is going ahead with the buy back then all the material facts should be given, the necessity for such buyback should be given, what are the class of shares which are being bought back or the securities which are being up bought back and what is the amount total amount which is involved with the buyback of the securities and what will be the time limit for the completion of the buy back.
All such information should be given to the shareholders in the explanatory statement in the notice which is sent to the to the shareholders.
Now every buyback has to be completed within one year of the date of passing of the special resolution for the buyback.
This is a another requirement of section this section under the companies act and buy back and from whom the buyback can be done? It can be from the existing shareholders or the security holders on the proportionate basis or it can be from the open market or it can be from purchasing shares which are with the employees of the company, which were given this shares as sweat equity shares or under the stock option, employees stock option scheme.
So these are the three sources or three targets whom the company can decide from whom the company wants to go for buyback of shares.
Now another requirement is that there has to be a declaration of solvency by the board of directors of the company.
And what is the declaration of solvency, that the company is capable of meeting is liabilities and it will not be rendered insolvent within a period of one year from the date of declaration which is adopted by the board.
So this is what has to be kept in mind that declaration of solvency has to be given to the ROC that the company will not become insolvent within one year from the buy back.
Now over here if a company is a listed company then this declaration of solvency has to be given to SEBI also.
Then in the case of this declaration of solvency it has to be signed by two directors of the company and if the company has one of the managing directors then the managing director has to sign this declaration of solvency.
Then after the completion of the process of buyback these shares should be physically destroyed or extinguished within next seven days.
And company should not go ahead with restrict with the further issue of share capital or the allotment of the new shares within a period of six months if the company faces a ban on the further issue of share capital after the buyback is complete for next six months.
But only the routine procedure which the company has to do that can be done like company can issue go ahead with the bonus issue of share.
And if the company has to convert certain warrants into shares that conversion can take place.
If the company has to come up with stock option scheme that scheme can be taken place that scheme can be followed sweat equity shares can be issued.
And if the preference shares have to be converted into equity shares such type of routine matters can be done.
But only the restrictions for the new allotment of shares.
Then after the buyback is complete then return has to be filed to the ROC.
Now section 70 has a certain prohibition on the buyback of securities that buyback is not allowed under certain conditions it says that no company should directly or indirectly purchase its own shares or any other specified securities through its subsidiaries or including its through any any of its subsidiaries including its own subsidiary companies.
It should not be through any investment company or group of investment companies.
And if the company has defaulted in repayment of deposits or the interest payment or redemption of debentures or preference shares or payment of dividend to any shareholders or repayment of any loan or any interest payable to any financial institutions or banking companies if any of these defaults is present the company will be prohibited from going ahead with the buyback.
And this prohibition is given under section 70 of the Companies Act 2013.
Now section 65 deals with unlimited company which converts into a limited company by passing a resolution.
It has to provide for certain reserve share capital and it says that if it wants to convert into a limited company it has to increase the nominal share capital of the company by increasing the nominal amount of each of its shares.
But the condition over here is that the increase capital can be called up only in the event and for the purposes of the winding up of the company.
This was capital cannot be called up before that and it also says that it should provide specified portion ofits uncalled share capital to be called up only in the event and for the purposes of the company being wound up.
So such type of a reserve has to be created by the company which is converting from the unlimited to unlimited company.
So this is the reserve share capital under section 65A of the 2013.
Let us come to the SEBI regulations which were amended in 2013.
So we are referring to SEBI buyback regulations amendment of 2013, certain important amendments were made in these regulations and which are under lot of debate also that whether they will be workable or not.
So the companies are mandated that they should buy at least 50% of the offer size otherwise there is a provision forfeiture of 2.5 % of the total amount, earmarked for the buyback.
Companies are mandated to keep 25% of the amount earmarked for the buy back in an escrow account in a separate acount and should have to complete the buy back process within a period of six months instead of 12 months.
So the buyback has to be now completed within a period of six month and promoters have been restricted from executing any transaction either in the on-market or off-market during the buyback period.
So this is a restriction on the promoters of the company.
And companies are also prohibited from raising further capital for one year from the closure of the buyback or make another buyback offer within a period of one year from the date of the closure of the preceding offer.
And companies are required to buy back 15% on more of the capital only by way of tender offer which is similar to book building process.
So these are the amendments which are made by the regulations in 2013.
let's now take some recent examples of buybacks which have been completed in 2014 only in India.
So about eight companies they completed their share buy-back process in 2014 and they had targeted tobuy back shares from the public for rupees 297 crore through the open market route on the stock exchanges and the few of the names of these companies are Maharashtra Seamless, Motilal Oswal Financial Services, Gujarat Apollo Industries they were the major companies which offered buy- back and they had completed the buyback process of rupees 297 crores.
So this is all in brief about the alteration of capital and its implications.
Public Offer, as the term indicates that this is an offer which is made by the company to the public.
This is an offer for the public issue where the company wants to raise money from the public.
It can be in the form of IPO that is Initial Public Offering.
Or FPO, that is Further Public Offering.
Or OFS, OFS is Offer for Sale.
Now, what is meant by Initial Public Offer? As again the name indicates that the public offer which is initially made which is the first public offer by any company.
it can be a newly listed company which is going for public offer .
It can be any listed company which has so far although it has listed its securities but has not gone for any public issue.
that can be any unlisted company which wants to get its securities listed and reach the public through the public offer.
Or it can be a listed company which is for the first time going to the public through its Initial Public Offer.
In further public offering or the issue of capital is by the listed companies which have earlier gone through the public issues And now they want to increase their share capitals.
that is why they are going ahead with the further public offer.
Offer for sale is aware existing shareholders of the company.
They want to sell their shares to the, they want to propose to sell their shares to the public.
That will be known as offer for sale.
For example if a promoter is having 50% shares in the company and he wants to offer them to the public then through the means of the company he can offer his shares to the public for sale .
Then it will be known as offer for sale.
Similarly, in the case of disinvestment by public sector undertaking, the Government of India is holding shares in the name of the President of India which are offered to the public for the disinvestment schemes through the means of a public issue.
Then it becomes offer for sale.
Now, Section 23 of the Companies Act 2013 says that a company can issue, a public company can issue securities to the public through the means of prospectus.
They can also issue securities through the means of private placement through the rights issue of bonus issue.
what is meant by prospectus? discuss it little later.
prospectus is offer document which gives an offer to the shareholders for the for buying securities or subscribing to the securities or shares of the company.
Private placement, when it is given, when the offer is given to selected group of person.
And rights issue is when the offer is given to the existing shareholders.
Bonus issue is when the offer is WHEN THE shares are issued to existing shareholders where they don't have to pay the value of the shares.
And when a company is going for the public offer then it has to list its securities.
The listing of securities and the listing agreement is provided by SCRA only after the listing of securities any public offer can be made by the public company to the public.
Let us now discuss what is private placement.
Private placement defined by Section 23 of the Companies Act, 2013 where it first of all it says that have a private company can issue Securities.
A private company can issue securities obviously through rights issue and bonus issue because rights issue is given to the existing shareholders.
And bonus issue is also given to the existing shareholders free of cost.
A private company can raise funds through these 2 methods.
And also it can go ahead with the private placement.
Section 42 says that private placement does not include cannot be given to qualified institutional buyers.
And it can also not given to the employees of the company.
Because employees of the companies, they receive securities under the employee stock option.
this cannot be given to the employees of the company.
Let’s come to the Rights Issue.
The rights issue as I told you that it is made to the existing shareholders of the company.
when the company is in need of other issue of capital.
the first offer is given to the existing shareholders of the company.
they can 15 to 30 days time is given to them.
that if they want to accept those shares that can accept to share otherwise they can reject it.
Or they can use their right to renounce this shares in favor of any other person.
this is what is meant by the rights issue.
Bonus issue is when the capitalization of profit is done by the company.
if the company has free reserves or it has profits in the securities premium account .
Or if it has a capital redemption reserve, amount from this can be transferred in the form of shares.
And these shares can be issued to the existing shareholders of the company free of cost.
Now there are certain exceptions where the companies not required to issue any prospectus.
this is the first where shares are given to the existing shareholders.
or existing debenture holders has so than full a prospectus is not required Only an offer document is to be made by the company giving the necessity of raising this fund.
that is how the company decides the proportions.
no prospectus is to be issued but an offer document has to be sent to them.
And then in the case of where shares and debentures were earlier issued.
And they they already listed and their uniform, the new issues also uniform in the in all respects with the existing shares or debentures then the company is also not required to issue any prospectus.
Now let us come to the deemed prospectus.
Now any document where a company is giving offer for sale that is also deemed to be a prospectus.
Because in case of offer for sale one existing shareholders through the company is selling its shares to the company.
this is offer for sale by existing shareholders of the company but the document which is made through which the public is invited to subscribe for thes share that document is also deemed to be a prospectus.
Now let us understand what is a shelf prospectus.
Now shelf prospectus is meant for those companies or public Financial Institutions are scheduled commercial banks which are frequently raising money from the public.
if you look into the financial institutions or the scheduled banks, all of them.
They are raising money because they have to give this to the other people who require money from the banks or the loan from the bank.
they have to raise frequently from the public in such a situation every time they have to make a prospectus.
facility is given to them that they can make a shelf prospectus for one with the tendency of 1 years.
in during that year company can raise any company can raise 3 or 4 times a public issue through the same prospectous.
shelf prospectus is like a prospectus or the information which is lying on the shelf in the office of the registrar companies.
once the prospectus has been file.
During 1 year the company can go ahead with 2 or 3 or 4 depending upon the need of the company for the public issues on the similar type of shares or the debentures for which the shelf prospectus has been made.
They have to be uniform in all matters which are given in the shelf prospectus.
the company is not required to every time to write a prospectus and submitted to ROC.
Now over here but the thing which has to be maintained by the company that, let say that company has come up with one public issue.
Now after 3 months the company goes ahead second public issue on the same shelf prospectus.
Within these 3 months, whatever changes in the financial position of the company has incurred or is any information which the public should know.
That information should be filed in the form of information memorandum to ROC.
that the necessary changes can be made and this information can be circulated to the public also.
this is the requirement in case of a company goes for shelf prospectus.
let us now discuss the Red Herring Prospectus.
Red Herring Prospectus does not have the quantum of the securities which are being offered by the company and also does not have the final price of the securities.
If there is any change in the Red Herring Prospectus that changes to be notified in the full prospectus.
what is Abridged prospectus? Abridged prospectus is a short perspective which contains only the salient features of the prospectus.
Now prospectus is document and it is not possible for a company to give prospectus to the huge prospectus to everyone because a lot of expenditure is involved in treating such kind of a prospectus.
So the Companies Act gives this privilege to the companies that they can make an abridged prospectus which contains salient features of the full prospectus.
And they can be issued along with the application form to the respective investors.
if investor want to read the full prospectus he can write to the company and get the full copy of the full prospectus.
this is what is meant by the abridged prospectus.
we have discussed what is prospectus, shelf prospectus, red herring prospectus and abridged prospectus.
Now this prospectus as I told you this, all this information which is given by the company in the prospectus has to be through information because public is at the mercy of the promoters of the company.
What they write the prospectus on the basis of that they invest their hard earned money.
the golden rule public deposits it says that the public is at the mercy of the companies’ promoters.
whatever is stated in the prospectus should be stated as scrupulous and as scrupulous as accurate possible.
that is why there are liabilities which are put up on the promoters of the company or the directors of the company.
If the prospectus contains any untrue statement or any misrepresentation or any false statement.
let us now discuss the liability for misstatement in the prospectus.
first liability is in the form of tortuous liability.
This liability which is given under the heading of damages for deceit.
And the most important case in the leading case over here is there is Derry vs. Peek.
Now in this case what happened there was a company which was running, which used to run tramways through the mechanical power.
the company wanted to have a sanction for running the tramways by steam power and the company had applied for the sanctions .
2 sanctions are required.
1 was a from the Parliament and other was from Board of trade.
The Parliament had given the sanction that the company can go ahead with steam running tramways with the steam power.
On the basis of this ,they issued a prospectus where they had written the directors that written the prospectus.
If company has now necessary sanction for running tramways on the with steam power so the company will be a profit earning company and the huge profits will be gained by the company.
on the basis of this the shareholders applied for the shares.
Later on the board of trade refuse to give this grant this sanction to the company.
few shareholders they sued the directors of the company that the directors they had given a false statement in the company.
Due to which the shareholders they have faced loss because the company has not got the approval for running tramways on by the steam power.
over here the director were not held liable on the ground that they had this honest believe that the approval by the board of trade will be given.
Because once the approval is given by the parliament the board of trade will definitely give the there was a honest believe that approval will be given.
the directors were not held liable against the for compensating the shareholders.
Now this created a lot of problem.
Because on the basis of honest believe the directors they were able to save themselves against the dispute which was raised by the shareholders for the false statement which they had made.
that is why to take care of this issue requirement of compensation was fixed up which is in the form of civil liability under section 35.
That even if the directors have the honest believe but the statement is false, they will be held liable to compensate the shareholders.
every director of the company, every person who authorized himself to be named as the director of the company, every promoter of the company who is named as promoter in of the prospective and every expert who has consented to give expert opinion on the prospectus.
All 4 of them, they will be held liable to compensate the shareholder.
And shareholder who has suffered loss due to the statement which was false and their liability will be joint and several liability.
this is how the problem which was created through the decision of Derry vs Peek week was overcome by putting this section of compensation under section 35 of the Companies Act.
Next is a rescission for misrepresentation.
This remedy lies in the hands of the shareholder.
if he wants to take back his shares, he can apply to the court for cancellation of his contract for of shares.
he will return the share certificate to the company and company will refund his money back to him.
But obviously there are certain precautions which have to be taken by the shareholder over here.
They should not be undue delay in that, shareholder should not affirm that he has received.
And now he is keeping with his share and also the winding up process should not begin in between.
if the shareholder affirms, if there is undue long delay for offering for rescission for misrepresentation .
Or the winding up of the company has started than this remedy will not be available in the hands of the shareholder.
The next remedy is in the form of criminal liability which is given by section 34.
over here if any false statement or any untrue statement is given by the directors of the company then that they can be held liable.
Under section 447 of the Companies Act ,2013 which deals with punishment for fraudulent purposes.
this is a common section which supplies at number of places.
even if a person gives a false statement , even if the false statement relates to the prospectus the directors and promoters will be liable for this.
And criminally liable for this under section 447.
the false statement or untrue statement can be false in context.
It can be false in form.
It can be untrue.
Or it can be also misleading.
if it is misleading and due to these statement or the misrepresentation if the investor is mislead for investing in the company.
Then the directors that can be held liable under this particular section.
Now what will be the difference to the directors.
They can say that the statement was immaterial.
Or the fact was immaterial then they can say that they honestly believe and at the till the time of the issue of the prospectus they believe that this statement is true.
They can also say that the person did not authorize the prospectus containing such true statement or misrepresentation.
And when he came to know that this has been published he gave a public notice of this .
Or he can also give as a difference that he was not the director of the company.
And when he came to know that his name is put up as a director in the prospectus then he give a public notice of this.
these are few defences which are available to the person.
When they are criminally held liable under this particular section.
Then another a last remedy is under section 36 which is about punishment for falsely inducing persons to invest money.
if any person is inducing any person on the basis of the false information to invest money then this can also be punished under Section 447 of the Companies Act.
Good I am Dr. Harpreet Kaur.
I am professor of law at National Law University, Delhi.
Today, I will be dealing with module 5 of the course of Corporate Law.
This module is about share capital; the types of shares, the nature of the shares, kinds of shares and also what is the need of the companies to have a share capital and will also discuss the rights and liabilities of the shareholders.
So if we look into the objectives of this course the students will understand that what is the need of a company to raise a share capital or can it manage its affairs or business needs through the means of the borrowing.
Then, if it is a share capital has been raised what are the types of shares that can be raised by the company.
What are the rights of different types of shareholders and then what is the nature of the of a share what is the basic nature of a share and also we will also understand what are the expectations of a company from the shareholders and what are the rights and duties of the shareholders of a company? So, let us first of all understand what is the difference between capital and a share capital of a company? So, you see that whether it is a capital whether it is a share capital both the terms these terms are used synonymously.
So, capital if it is divided into smaller units in the form of shares it is known as a share capital and it is a need of the company to get incorporated with the capital if the company wants to conduct a business.
Although, the Companies Act does not say that having a capital is a compulsory requirement for incorporating a company.
But most of the companies they get incorporated along with the capital because they are incorporated for the purpose of running a business and for running a business and conducting a business a company needs to have a capital.
Now, the capital clause of the memorandum says that you have to mention what will be the authorised capital of the company and how many shares it will it will be divided.
The number of the share should be written and also the fixed amount of the share should also be written in the memorandum of the of any company which is getting incorporated.
Now, if you look into 1956 Act, then the section 13 4A of the Companies Act of 1956, it said that you have to mention the nominal capital its amount and also the value of the shares and also the number of shares which will be raised by the company.
Similarly, section 4E of the Companies Act, 2013 also gives this requirement that the company has to write the nominal value or the amount of the capital with which it is getting incorporated and also the fixed amount of the shares and also the number of the shares into which the capital will be divided and it is necessary that no subscriber to the memorandum should have less than one share.
Now, minimum Capital requirement is also a requirement at a given by the Companies Act like; for a public company it is necessary that it should have a minimum paid up share capital of 5 lakh Rupees at the time of incorporation and for a private company it is necessary that it should have a share capital of minimum one lakh at the time of incorporation and these provisions are given by section 2 subsection 71 and sub section 68 of the Companies Act, 2013.
Now, the question arises that how a company decides that what type of a capital? How it should raise the capital, whether it should be through the public issue whether it should be through the investors from the public or it should borrow the money.
So, complete financial analysis has to be done by the company with how much amount it wants to raise?What is the market sentiment, what is the interest rate or what type of dividend it will have to give, what amount of dividend it will have to give and it is also required to know that whether the borrowings, whether the loan is available for the company or whether the investors are ready to invest into the company? All this analysis has to be done by the company before it decides that how it should go ahead with the rising of the share capital.
Now, if the company decides ultimately that it should raise a share capital then the question arises that whether it should be equity share capital or the preference share capital because these are the two types of share capital which can be raised by the company under the present Companies Act.
And these were the only two types which were there under the 1956, Companies Act also.
Let us now have a look at what is the share capital? So, as I told you that memorandum has a capital clause which has to give the amount of the nominal value of the capital and its division into number of shares.
So, the amount which is authorised by the memorandum, the amount which can be raised by the company which is author memorandum that amount is known as authorised capital.
So, if a companies capital clause writes that company is authorised to raise one thousand crores, So one thou crores will be the authorised capital that can be raised by the company at the time of requirement of any money.
Now, out of this one thousand crore depending upon the need of the company, company can issue issue can go for public issue to have to raise the funds.
Let say the type company decides at present I need 50 percent of the capital so company can go at with public issue of 500 crores.
So, that 500 crores which is issued to the public is known as issued capital of the company.
Now, out of this issued capital every company wants that hundred percent should be subscribe by the public ,so that it is able to raise 500 crore rupees so the portion of the issued capital which is subscribed by the public is known as subscribed capital.
If it is hundred percent then it will be 500 crore if it is 90 percent then it will be accordingly 90 percent of 500 crores.
Now, there is another thing which we need to understand that there is a requirement of minimum subscription which a company has to achieve at the time of public issue.
So, presently the minimum subscription is 90 percent of the issued capital.
Let us now come to the kinds of share capital: the 1956, Act said that a company can issue equity share capital, preference share capital, derivatives and hybrids.
So we’ll take care of the equity share capital and preference share capital in a little while.
First of all let's understand what is a derivative so the Companies Act say the derivative,the same definition which is given by securities contracts Regulation Act of 1956 that will apply to the definition of the derivative.
In hybrid securities will be securities which will have characters of more than two types of securities and including their derivatives also.
But now this act has been repealed so we will not go into the details of this Act.
I will come to the position of 2013 and the under section 43 the Companies Act says that a company can raise equity share capital and preference share capital.
Now what is equity share capital? It says that the capital which is not having all that capital which is not a preference share capital will be known as will be known as equity share capital that means first of all we need to understand what is a preference share capital? The preference share capital is a capital where the shareholders will be having to preferred rights.
What are those two preferred rights? One is preferred right of dividend that is preferential dividend.
Another is that at the time of winding up of the company or repayment of the capital.
The preference shareholders they will have the right of payment.
They will have the first right or the preferred right of payment.
So, all that share capital which has these preferential rights these two of these preferential rights that will be known as preference share capital where as rest of the capital will be known as equity share capital, so that means that equity share capital is ordinary share capital of the company.
Now, there can be two types of equity shares, first equity shares with voting rights second equity shares with differential rights as two voting or dividend or otherwise whatever extra differential rights are given to them.
So, these are two basic types of equity shares which can be issued by the company .
Coming to the preference share capital we know that they have two preferred rights: one is preferential right of dividend and second is preferential right of payment at the time of winding up of the company and at the time of repayment of the capital.
So, these are two rights which are given to the preference shareholders.
Now, section this section 43 of 2013, Act has also talked about deemed preference capital.
Now, what is deemed preference capital? It says that if capital has either of the two rights or both the two rights apart from having their preferential rights which are given to them as the preferential right of dividend and preferential right of repayment at the winding up if any of these two rights are given given to the share capital share holders then that part of the capital will be known as a deemed share capital.
Now, what are the rights? First right is entitlement to dividend that along with the preferential right of dividend if the if the capital is having an entitlement to dividend in the surplus after the payment of dividend has been made in the surplus dividend .
If they are participating, if they are getting this right of entitlement into that dividend then then this will be known as deemed preference capital.
Now, they are participating along with the shareholders or along with the capital which is not having a preferential right of capital.
Now the second right says that they have entitlement to repayment at the time of winding up and this is in addition to the differential right of winding up which there already having.
So, in the case of deemed preference besides having two preferential rights which are given to them under the preference share capital they may have either of these two rights or they may have both of these two rights so then this capital will be known deemed preference capital.
Now, besides that there are two types of preference shares participating and non participating cumulative and non-cumulative.
Now, what are non-cumulative and accumulated shares in participating shares? So, in case of when the company has paid the dividend and surplus dividend is left.
If the preference shareholders they have the right to participate in the surplus dividend or at the time of winding up of the company.
If the preference shareholders they have right to participate in the cash which is left with the company or the assets which is surplus which is left with the company then they are known as participating.
If they do not have this right then their non-participating type.
In case of cumulative preference shares, if in one of the financial years let say company is not able to make any profit and the profit is not paid.
Preferred dividend is not given to the preference shareholders.
If this arrear of non-payment is carried forward to another financial to next financial year where the company is making profit and the preferred dividend is paid to the preference shareholders then the cumulative type of preference shareholders.
That means arrears of non-payment of preferential dividend if it gets carried forward to the next year where the company is making profit and distributing preferential dividend then they are known as cumulative type of preference shares otherwise they are non-commutative type of preference shares.
So, you can understand that when the company is coming up with public issue either of equity shares or of preference shares company has to indicate that what type of equity shares it is issuing to the public or what type of preference shares it is issuing to the public.
Now, there was the third category of preference shares which were known as irredeemable preference shares.
Now we do not have this category anymore with us.
So, there cannot be anything known as irredeemable.
So, this is given under the rules 2014.
Now, if the preference shareholders they agreed to it before 21st year also the preference shareholders they can be redeemed, depending upon the wish of the preference shareholders.
So this is how, we know that every preference share holder has to be a redeemable preference shareholders and the requirement is that only fully paid preference shares can be redeemed half paid or partially paid preferential shares cannot be redeemed.
Now, from where the money for redemption will come? Redemption means that we are paying back the money to the preference shareholders along with the premium if there has to be paid any.
So, the money which can be used by the companies that the company can use its profits which it has collected for dividend which is available for dividend and also out of the proceeds of an early in any any fresh issue which is made only for the purpose of the redemption of the preference shares.
So, two options are there with the company; either to go with the dividend, either to go with the profits which is available with the company for the distribution as dividend or company can have a fresh issue of shares only for the purpose of redemption of the preference shares.
So, in these two options company has to decide which way it want to go ahead with the redemption.
Now, where company is the redeeming preference shares from the profits of the company then the same amount has to be kept by the company in a separate account which is known as capital redemption reserve.
Now, why this capital redemption reserve is required? Because when we are redeeming preference shares we are having a loss of share capital.
Share capital is getting reduced.
We do not want the share capital to be reduce, so that is why the same amount is kept in the capital redemption reserve so that it does not lead to any reduction of the share capital and whatever premium has to be paid that premium can be paid at the time of redemption from the either from the profits of the company or from the securities premium account.
So, this was in brief about the issue and redemption of preference shares.
Another provision which has been put up by 2013, Act is about deemed redemption.
Now, what is deemed redemption? Let's say that a company has to redeem preference shares worth one crore in this year and company does not have money to repay and company does not want to go for fresh issue of securities maybe companies not sure that it will be able to raise that much of money for redeeming purposes, so both the options and it does not have profits to redeem also.
So, another option which has been given to the companies by the Companies Act, 2013 is that in the form of deemed redemption.
Now, what is that form,that whatever redemption amount has to be paid which is the principal amount the share capital, share value plus the dividend; all that can be redeemed in the form of issuing new preference shares to the company, to the preference shareholders.
So, instead of getting cash they are getting new preference shares of the company.
So, this will be deemed to be as redemption of the earlier preference shares and allocation or allotment of the new preference shares with the shareholders.
And once this year redemption of the preference shares is capital the company is complete the company has to inform to the ROC.
This is the requirement of the Companies Act that ROC should be informed that, that company has redeemed preference shares.
Let us now come to the rights of shareholders and or the members.
So the first most important right is of the voting rights.
Now section 47 talks about the voting rights of the equity shareholders and preference shareholders.
Now equity shareholders have the voting rights which can be exercised by them for all the decisions of the company which a company is entitled to make in the General Meeting of the company .
So the decisions which shareholders which the company has to take in the General Meeting of the company the equity shareholders they have the right to vote in all such decisions and on poll their rights will be in equal in proportion to the shares which they are having in the share capital of the company.
Now about preference shareholders, they have a Right to Vote only on the matters which are related to preference shareholders then they can vote they can exercise their voting rights on the winding up of the company, on the repayment of the company or reduction of the capital.
So whether it is the repayment of the preference share capital or reduction of equity share capital they have the right to vote .
So their right to vote is limited because equity shareholders are having more rights in comparison to the preference shareholder so they become more powerful in the company.
Another voting right which is given to the preference shareholders is that if for 2 years dividend is not paid to preference shareholders then they have the right to vote for all the matters of the company as they are voted by as equity shareholders would .
So this is a very important rights which comes to preference shareholders if they are not given the dividend by the company their preferential dividend by the company for a period of 2 years.
Now the next right is of dividend.
Section 143 is about the dividend.
Every shareholder of the company has the right to claim the dividend from the company,once it is declared by the board of directors and even if it is interim dividend is declared by the board they also have the right to claim this dividend but the difference over here is that once the dividend the yearly dividend is declared by board of directors , it becomes the debt owed by the company, where as interim dividend can be taken back by the company.
After its announcement it can be withdrawn by the company also.
So this is the right of the dividend of the shareholders.
Then third right is, right of to have uniform calls on shares.
So then the company is making calls for collection of uncalled capital of the company then at that point in time, the shareholders they have this right that this call should be uniform for one class of shareholders, so there should not be any discrimination in the case of a particular class of shareholders ,that a few of them are getting they have to give more amount in comparison to rest of them.
So they have the right that call should be uniform call when it is made by the company for one class of shareholders.
Then the third the next point is that they have the right to be paid at the winding up of the company.
So when the winding up starts an official liquidator is appointed and it takes into account of the statement of affairs of the company so first of all he has to pay all the statutory dues of the employees apart from that we are not talking about the statutory dues of the employees but first of all he has to pay out all the the creditors of the company.
So all the shareholders, they have the right to be paid at the time of winding up of the company.
Now let's come to Section 48 which talks about variation of shareholders rights.
Now if the company is making any change or modifying the rights of the shareholders and consent of those shareholders is required.
So, if there is variation in one particular class of rights of shareholders then they should agree in writing by three fourth majority or a special resolution of that particular class should be passed by the shareholders and then only the company can go ahead with the variation of shareholders right.
So company, on its own discretion cannot make any change in the variation of cannot make or vary the rights of the shareholders of the company.
The next over here if shareholders there are some shareholders who are descending to this variation.
Next is right of participation in the "Annual General Meeting".
Annual General Meeting is the most important meeting of the company which has to be compulsorily held annually as per the provisions of the Companies Act.
Now over here all the shareholders they have the right that they should participate they can participate in the Annual General Meeting because all the decisions are taken in this meeting.
Director's reports is given, Chairman's messages is given, director's responsibility statement, auditor's report is given, annual balance sheet of the company, financial accounts of the company for profit and loss account of the company ; all such information is laid before the shareholders in this meeting.
So shareholders have the right to participate in this meeting and they have the right to get the notice of as per the requirement of the companies Act that they are required to have a notice notifying them about the date,time and the place of the meeting and also the agenda which is the ordinary agenda and the special business at if it has to be transacted at the time of the meeting.
So all this information should be given to the shareholders to participate in the Annual General Meeting of the company.
Next is their rights issue.
Existing shareholders of a company, they have the right to have a first offer towards the further issue of capital.
So if the company is raising capital through the follow on public offering or FPO then the .
first right will be with the existing shareholders that these shares should be offered to them.
If they do not take any of the action in 30 days passes then these shares,they ago in the hands of the board of directors of the company and board of directors of the company they have to now allot these shares in such a manner that it should not be disadvantageous to the company.
It should not be injurious to the interest of the shareholders.
So these two factors have to be taken into consideration by board of directors at the time of issuing these shares.
Next is their right to transfer shares and securities or other interest in the company.
As we discussed that Section 44 says that securities shares or other interest of a shareholder or a member in a company is freely transferable.
So transfer is also one of the rights which is given to the shareholders.
In case of a public company there cannot be any restriction on the free transferability of the shares whereas in the case of a private company, restrictions can be put up by the board of directors of the company or these restrictions have to be written in the articles of the company only then company can restrict this.
The entire process of transfer has to be followed in the case when the transfer he wants to get registered as a shareholder of the company.
This is all about the share capital, its nature and rights and duties of the shareholders.

This is in brief introduction about the Corporate law course.
Welcome to the MOOC's Programme on Corporate Law.
As a part of the mooc's programme on Corporate Law this module is on the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016.
I am Dr. Risham Garg ,I am Assistant Professor of law and also the Research Director of Centre for Transnational Commercial Law in the National Law University, Delhi.
As a part of this Corporate Law, mooc's course is a model module on insolvency and bankruptcy code.
It deals with the Insolvency, Bankruptcy of Corporate persons as well as natural persons.
I will start by giving a brief overview about the module.
The IBC 2016 aims to consolidate the laws relating to insolvency of companies and limited liability entities.
Including limited liability partnership and other entities with limited liability.
Unlimited liability partnerships and individuals presently contained in a number of legislations into a single legislation.
Such consolidation will provide for a greater clarity in law and facilitate the application of consistent and coherent provisions to different stakeholders affected by business failure or inability to pay debt.
Key objectives of an insolvency law.
Although conferee approaches vary.
There is broad agreement that effective and efficient insolvency regimes should aim to achieve the key objective identified in a balanced manner.
Whatever design is chosen for an insolvency law that will meet these key objectives.
The insolvency law must be complementary too.
And compatible with the legal and social values of the society in which it is based and which it must ultimately sustain.
Although, insolvency law generally forms a distinctive regime.
It ought not to produce results that are fundamentally and conflict with the premises upon which laws other than the insolvency law are based.
Introduction an effective insolvency regime critical component of ease of doing business in India.
In India, the legal and constitutional machinery for dealing with debt default has not been in line with Global standards.
The recovery action by predators either through the Contract Act or through special laws such as the recovery of debts due to Banks and Financial Institutions Act, 1993 and the SRFAESI Act, 2002 has not seen desired outcomes.
Similarly, action through the SICA and the winding up provisions of the Companies Act, 1956 have neither been able to aid recovery for lenders nor a restructuring of firms.
Laws dealing with individual insolvency.
The Presidency Towns Insolvency Act 1909 and the Provincial Insolvency Act, 1920 are almost century old.
This has hampered the confidence of the lender.
When lenders are unconfident the debt access for borrowers is diminished.
This reflects in the state of the credit markets in India.
Secured credit by banks is the largest component of the credit market in India.
Now, starting with the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code 2016.
The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code 2016 here in after referred to as the code provides a comprehensive law to deal with insolvency and bankruptcy of corporate entities and natural persons.
This discussion is divided in following sections.
First, the salient features of the IBC 2016.
Second, 4 pillars of institutional infrastructure.
Third corporate insolvency resolution process.
And fourth, the liquidation process.
The statement of objects of the IBC states that code has been in acted to consolidate and amend the laws relating to reorganisation and insolvency resolution of corporate persons, partnership firms and individuals in a time bound manner for maximization of value of assets of such persons.
To promote entrepreneurship ,availability of credit and balance the interest of all stakeholders including alteration in the order of priority of payment of government dues.
And to establish an insolvency and bankruptcy board of India and for matters connected therewith or incidental there to.
The salient features of the IBC 2016 are as follows.
Clear, coherent and speedy process for early identification of financial distress and resolution of companies and limited liability entities of the underlying business is found to be viable.
2 distinct processes for resolution of individuals namely, fresh start and insolvency resolution.
DRT and NCLT to act as Adjudicating Authority and deal with the cases related to insolvency liquidation and bankruptcy process in respect of individuals.
Second, 4 pillars of institutional infrastructure.
The 4 pillars of institutional infrastructure are Insolvency Professionals, Information Utilities, Adjudication and Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India.
Now, Insolvency Professionals are the first pillar of institutional infrastructure.
They are a class of regulated persons.
They would play a key role in the efficient working of the bankruptcy process.
They would be regulated by insolvency professional agencies.
Information Utilities are the second pillar of institutional infrastructure.
These are required to store facts about lenders and terms of landing in electronic database.
This would eliminate delays and disputes about facts when default does take place.
Adjudication, the third pillar institutional infrastructure is an adjudication.
The NCLT will be the forum where firm insolvency will be heard.
And DRTs will be the forum where individual insolvencies will be heard.
These Institutions along with the replied bodies which the NCLT and the DRATs will be adequately strengthens whereasto achieve world-class functioning of the bankruptcy process.
Adjudicator the National Company Law Tribunal.
The Adjudicating Authority in relation to insolvency resolution and liquidation for corporate persons including corporate debtors and personal guarantors thereof is the National Company Law Tribunal here in after referred to as the NCLT.
The Territorial Jurisdiction of the NCLT will be over the place where the registered office of the corporate person is located.
The NCLT before which a corporate insolvency resolution process or liquidation proceeding of a corporate data analysis is pending will also have jurisdiction in the matter of the insolvency resolution or bankruptcy of personal guarantor of such corporate dater.
Civil Court not to have jurisdiction.
No Civil Court or authority has jurisdiction to entertain a nice to talk proceeding in respect of any matter on which NCLT or the NCLAT has jurisdiction under this code.
No Court tribunal or authority shall grant and injunction in respect of any action taken or to be taken in pursuance of any power conferred on the NCLT or the NCLAT under the code.
The Insolvency and Bankruptcy board of India.
The fourth pillar of Institutional Infrastructure is the regulator.
The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India hereinafter referred to as the board with head office in the National Capital Region and offices at other places in India.
The Central Government has the power to designate a financial sector regulator to perform the function still such board is constituted.
Until the board is constituted or a financial sector regulated is designated under section 195.
As the case may be the powers and functions of the board or such designated financial sector regulator including its power to make regulations shall be exercised by the central government.
Constitution of Board of and the selection of members.
There will be Chairperson, 3 ex-officio members from amongst the officers of the Central Government ,not below the rank of Joint Secretary.
And 1 ex-officio member to be nominated by the Reserve Bank of India.
And 5 others to be nominated by the Central Government.
The Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process, Commencement.
The standard to be made for commencement of Insolvency Proceeding is Central to the design of an Insolvency Law.
As the basis upon which insolvency proceedings can be commenced.
This standard is instrumental to identifying the debtors.
That can be brought within the protective anticipatory mechanism of the insolvency law and determining who make an application for commencement whether the debtor, creditor or other parties.
before moving onto the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process.
I would also like to point out that the Insolvency and Bankruptcy code also addresses the insolvency and bankruptcy resolution of the natural persons.
The person’s individuals and also the unincorporated partnership firms.
The Adjudicating Authority for the individuals, persons, natural persons and partnership firms is the DRT, the Debt Recovery Tribunals.
The Debt Recovery Tribunals are set up or are slated to be set up in each and every district of the country.
And as per the provisions in the code they will ensure the process for insolvency and the bankruptcy resolution of the unincorporated persons.
A major element which is provided by the IBC with respect to the natural persons is the process which is called as the first process.
And this process benefits the individuals with a minimum level of income.
The corporate insolvency resolution process commencement.
The standard to ‘We Met for commencement of insolvency’ proceeding is Central to the design of an insolvency law.
As the basis upon which insolvency proceedings can be commenced.
This standard is instrumental to identifying the debtors that can be brought within the protective anticipatory mechanism of the insolvency law.
And determining who make an application for commencement whether the debtor, creditor or other parties.
Trigger point for initiation.
Corporate insolvency resolution process may be initiated under Chapter 2 of the code in respect of a corporate debtor that has committed a default.
The trigger point for initiating the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process is the occurrence of a default.
A default would have occurred when the debtor fails to pay whole or any part or installment of the amount of that that has become due and payable.
Who can initiate the process? The process for initiating corporate insolvency resolution may be initiated by any of the following.
THE financial creditor and operational creditor or the corporate debtor itself.
Commencement by financial creditor.
Application by financial creditor.
A financial creditor may initiate the process either by itself or jointly with other financial creditors by filing an application before the NCLT .
If a default has occurred in respect of a financial that would not only to the applicant financial creditor but to any other financial creditor of the corporate debtor.
Ascertaining existence of debt default by NCLT.
Within 14 days of application by NCLT.
It must acertain the existence of a default from the records of information utility on the basis of other evidence furnished by the financial creditor.
If NCLT satisfied that the default is occurred or the application made by financial creditor is complete.
Or there is no disciplinary proceeding pending against the proposed resolution professional.
It may by order admit such application under SICA.
Admission of a reference midsto BIFR was by way of an administrative act of registration of reference by the registry of BIFR.
Now, an order must be passed by NCLT.
It appears that corporate debtor need not be heard by n NCLT while ascertaining the existence of default.
Date of commencement.
The corporate insolvency resolution process shall commence from the date of admission of the application of financial creditor by the NCLT.
Order of admission of such application shall be communicated by the NCLT to the applicant and corporate debtor and of rejection to the financial creditor within 7 days.
Declaration of moratorium and public announcement.
With regards to creditors 1 of the fundamental principles of insolvency law is that, insolvency proceedings are collective proceedings which required the interest of all creditors to be protected against individual action by one of them.
Many insolvency laws include a mechanism to protect the value of the insolvency a state that not only prevents creditors from commencing actions to enforce their rights through legal remedies.
During some or all of the period of the liquidation or reorganisation proceedings but also suspense actions already underway against the debtors.
Such a mechanism is variously termed as moratorium, suspension or stay depending on the effect of the mechanism.
Moratorium.
The order to declare Moratorium prohibits.
Firstly, the institution of suits for continuation of pending suits or proceedings against the corporate debtors including execution of any judgment, decree or order in any Court of law, tribunal, arbitration panel or any other authority.
Transferring, encumbering, alienating or disposing of by the corporate debtor any of its assets or any legal right or beneficial interest there in.
Any action to foreclose, recover or enforce.
Any security interest created by the corporate debtor in respect of its property including any action under the securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002 or the SRFAESI Act.
The recovery of any property by an owner or lesser where such properties occupied by or in the possession of the corporate debtor.
Exclusion from Moratorium.
The order of Moratorium should not affect supply of essential goods or services to the corporate debtor which shall not be terminated or suspended or interrupted during moratorium period.
This is important to explore resolution of the corporate debtor as a going concern.
Conduct of Corporate Resolution Process by Resolution Professional.
The resolution professional is responsible for the conduct of the entire Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process.
And manage the operations of the corporate debtor during the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process period.
For this purpose, the Resolution Professional has the same powers and must perform same duties as best it or conferred on the interim Resolution Professional.
Resolution Plan.
A resolution applicant may submit a resolution plan to the resolution professional prepared on the basis of the information memorandum.
A resolution plan means a plan proposed by any person for insolvency resolution of the corporate debtor.
As a Going Concern in accordance with part 2 of the code as already mentioned resolution applicant means any person who submits resignation plan to the Resolution Professional.
The Resolution Professional shall examine each resolution plan received by him to confirm that it resolution plan is compliant of the specifications of the code.
Approval of Resolution Plan by the Creators.
A Resolution Plan must be played before the committee of creditors by the Resolution Professional for its approval.
the committee of creditors may approve a resolution plan by a vote of not less than 75 percent of voting shares of the financial creditors.
The resolution applicant may attend the meeting of the committee of creditors in which resolution plan of the applicant is considered.
Approval of the Plan by the NCLT.

This concludes this discussion on the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code.
Now, summarising the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code 2016.
The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code is a welcome initiative.
it prior to this code, the Insolvency Laws in India what we found in various statutes.
There were separate statutes for the personal insolvency for natural persons and also the partnership firms.
There were 2 of these acts and which are around 100 of old as far as corporate insolvency is concerned.
There is no provision clearly specifying the insolvency of a corporate person or a company.
What what what the 1956 Companies Act mention was that in failure to pay the debt the company can be wound up.
And most often misused or misapplied or criticized law where relating to the insolvency was the SICA.
So, SICA also involved the insolvency and also the restructuring of the companies.
The other 2 legislations related to insolvency weret the RDDB file Act and the SARFAESI Act, 2002.
But, these 2 legislations also were not able to effectively address the issues of the insolvency and the effective resolution of the companies.
The insolvency and bankruptcy also involves the winding up but also involves the opportunity of restructuring to be provided for by the company.
Apart from the IBC there are other mechanisms under the RBI mechanism which which is the corporate debt restructuring plan.
Which is a informal plan under which the companies can move the RBI for the restructuring of their debts.
Probably the most important aspect with respect to the person insolvency is a fresh start process which has been initiated in this IBC.
In the fresh start process individuals who have debt up to rupees with who have debts and personal assets till rupees 35,000 .
They are given a fresh start and there is a speedy resolution of their disputes.

Hello friends, myself Neha Kapur Assistant Professor at School of Law Galgotia University.
Today, I will be discussing about the SEBI regulations on issue of capital and disclosure requirements, that were passed in the year 2009.
The other parts of the first module will also deal with the promoters contribution in a public issue.
The pricing in a public issue the security requirements that have been laid down for the purpose of promoting or protecting the interest of investors such as the green shoe option application supported by backedamount etc.
The second part of the module which I will be discussing with you will elaborate upon the various kinds of issues laid down by a company through the private placement process as such.
These issues are basically the rights issue, the bonus issue, referential allotment of the securities.
Then qualified institutional placement institutional placement program .
And also In The End of the second module we will be discussing about the SEBI issue of and listing of the Dead securities regulations laid down in the year 2008.
First of all I will tell you a brief about what is the securities market in India.
The securities market in India is classified into two parts, that is the primary market and secondary market.
The primary market basically deals with the new issue segment or the first hand dealing of securities.
The first hand dealing of securities basically is done by a public issue.
That is through an IPO and FPO that is taken out by a company in the market and the secondary issue that is a secondary market consists of the dealings that are done in the second hand of the securities through a stock exchange that is the portion of the second market.
Secondary market the SEBI that is the securities and exchange Board of India regulates both the primary market as well as the secondary market.
First of all I will talk about the learning objectives that are supposed to be fulfilled by this particular module.
The most important objective firstly of this first module is to understand the need for the issue of capital and disclosure requirements and how it protects the interest of investors.
Initially in the year 2000 the SEBI had introduced the disclosure and the investor protection guidelines in the year 2000, which were later on resigned in the year 2009.
And they were replaced by the SEBI ICDR regulations, that is the issue of capital and disclosure requirements 2009.
These guidelines are basically applicable to public issues .
Secondly the rights issue where the aggregate value is 50 lakh rupees or more than thirdly preferential issues, then qualified institutional placement program by a listed issuer and the fourth is issues of Indian depository receipts.
First of all I will explain that what is a public issue, public issue basically is divided or as defined under the ICDR regulations means and IPO or an FPO that is an initial public offer or a further public offer.
Initial public offer is introduced by the company when it tries to first hand deals with the Securities or gives the issue to the people in the market to the investors for their issuance.
Specified securities which have been particularly defined under the ICDR regulations means the equity shares and the convertible debentures that are introduced by the company.
Coming to what is FPO, FPO is basically a further public offer where by a company introduces the shares of the debentures which are left over in the IPO to be introduced to the public for their subscription.
Coming next to what are the common conditions under the ICDR regulations passed in the year 2009.
The common conditions that a prescribed by the regulations are appointment of intermediaries, secondly filing of offer document, opening of issue, underwriting of public issue, dispatch of material, then minimum subscription.
Over subscription, the manner of calls allotment and the last being restriction on further issue etc.
First of all I will be discussing as to what are basically the common conditions that are laid down under this particular Regulation.
The common conditions are primarily are firstly that the company which is a listed company, a listed company basically means a companies that has been listed on stock exchange.
Listed company first of all has to appoint an intermediary in the nature of a merchant banker also in the terminology of the regulations known as a lead merchant banker, which is an intermediary in the securities market.
The lead merchant banker has to approach to the ROC and also has to file to the SEBI 30 days prior to the coming up with the issue the offer document of the securities.
The offer document of the securities is required to be filed 30 days before the coming of the public issue to be laid down by the company.
When we talk about the filing of the offer document.
It basically means that all the disclosures that are required to be done in the issue or in the of a document are required to be disclosed to the SEBI as well as to then ROC.
Secondly the offer document the details of the offer document that the company that is the listed issuer or the company is coming up in the securities market is required to be hosted on the website of the company where by it has to be disclosed.
That these are the disclosure that the company is making that is who is the promoter what is the capital with the company which company is coming up for the investors to subscribe to.
Thirdly, the issuer that is the company also has to disclose the details regarding the agreement that has been done between the issuer and the lead merchant banker including the due diligence certificate.
The due diligence certificate obtained from the debenture trustees and the certificate ensuring the Investors Protection.
Then coming to the specific requirements that have been laid down for a public issue under the ICDR regulations.
The eligibility requirements that have been laid down first of all under the ICDR regulations are that the issue or the public company is required to have the net tangible Assets of at least 3 crore Rupees at the time when the company comes up with a Public issue.
This is very important in the sense that any company coming up with the public issue or with IPO that is an IPO and FPO you should have net tangible assets.
That is the total amount of acids of that particular company should either be of the value of rupees three crore or even more than that.
The eligibility conditions regarding the pricing in a public issue basically provide for that what should be the price of the securities in the IPO or the FPO that the company or the listed company or the issuer has come up with.
The pricing in the public issue can be determined or on the basis of the prices that have been determined by the merchant banker in consultation with the company.
And also they can be determined through the book building process by the help of a book runner.
The prices of the securities are to be classified the prices of the securities can also be determined or can also be different from to the different investors that they are going to be given to.
The price band of the securities can also be decided by the company at the time of deciding or coming up with the public issue.
The next is the promoters contribution.
The promoter basically a person is a promoter of a company ,when he has taken the decisions pertaining to the capital formation or with respect to the functioning or the working of the company.
Basically a person is considered to be as a promoter who is having all the information, the first hand information of the company and regarding the formation of that particular company.
It can also be a promoter group and the ICDR regulations define the term promoter as well as the term promoter group as his relatives including his wife daughter or children etc.
A promoter should contribute in a public issue at least 20% of the post Issue Capital that is required to be obtained from the investors or 20% of the post Issue Capital after the subscription has been done through an IPO.
Regarding the conditions as laid down in the ICDR regulations about safety provisions concerning and IPO.
It is very important for a student of Corporate Law to understand that how the investors in the securities market are to be protected because the main aim of these regulations and these guidelines been laid down by the SEBI is to protect the interest of investors in the securities market.
As they are the people who are subscribing or paying money or providing funds to a particular company through an IPO.
The safety provisions basically mean that how the investor will be protected in the securities market.
First of all, I will be explaining as to what is meant by application supported by blocked amount ASBA is considered to be or in short which is known as ASBA.
It is considered to be as the most important feature now a days in the securities market because all the application money which the investor has to deposit to a particular company for subscribing to the shares of that particular company are to be now only transferred through a bank account of the issuer and of the investor.
And it is ASBA that is application supported by blocked amount is basically defined as an authorization to block the application money in bank account for subscribing to an issue.
It is now mandatory for issued to accept the funds for an issue only through ASBA.
That is application supported by blocked amount.
Secondly we will be discussing the safety net arrangement.
The safety net arrangement basically means or is an arrangement provided by the issuer under which a person offers to purchase the securities from the original resident retail individual allotee at the issue price.
The safety net arrangement has been basically made to ensure the protection of the investors in the securities market subject to disclosures and issuer may provide a safety net arrangement to purchase up to a maximum of 1000 specified securities per allottee within 6 months from the last date of dispatch of security certificate or credit of Demat account.
The third safety provision laid down under the ICDR regulations is the green shoe option.
The green shoe option which is in short also known as GSO.
Then the food safety provision under the regulations talk about underwriting of the shares under writing or basically underwriters are the persons who give a guarantee under the IPO that they will subscribe to the shares of a particular company in case there is the under subscription of the issue or if the securities have not been purchased by the investors underwriters subscribe to that particular issue.
Underwriting is basically a contract that is entered into by a company with persons or institution called underwriters who undertake to take the whole or a part of the open securities.
As may not be subscribed by the public in consideration of a remuneration that is called underwriting Commission.
That underwriting Commission the issuer company has to pay to the underwriters in lieu of which day will pay to the amount of the securities that are not being subscribed by the public.
Next the types of underwriting have been also provided under the company law that is the complete underwriting.
Secondly partial underwriting and the third is firm underwriting.
Complete underwriting basically means when the entire subscription that is remaining or that is left out will be purchased over by the underwriters to a particular issue.
Partial underwriting means that when only a part or a portion of the particular issue has been taken up or has been purchased by the underwriters to that particular IPO.
Firm underwriting basically means that when a firm arrangement has been made for the purpose of subscribing to that particular issued by the underwriters.
Next I will be discussing with the minimum offer to public and reservations etc.
Coming to what is minimum offer to public and reservations.
These guidelines under the ICDR regulations basically talk about as to what will be the minimum offer in a particular IPO that is required to be given to the public and what all has to be reserved in a particular case.
Allocation first of all we will study what is allocation in the book building process.
First of all coming to what is a book building process, a book building process basically means a process whereby the prices of the securities in the market are to be decided by the forces of demand and supply or on the basis of bids that are taken up by the investors on that particular issue.
That is the prices will only be determined on the basis of the bids that have been taken up the pubic and then the company would decide the prices of that the particular security taken now by on an IPO.
The allegation in the book building process students are I have told you.
Its to be classified into three parts, that is the non-institutional investors, the retail individual investors and the qualified intuitional investors as I have already told you the percentage of the issue that is required to be given to all these investors.
Retail individual investors are basically the investors who subscribe to lesser securities in the securities market or are less in number with respect to the securities allotted to them in non-institutional investors and the qualified institutional buyers are basically the people who invest more and they are in the form of mutual funds or debenture trustees or in the form of some insurance companies etc.
These companies and through these funds they have made lot more investment and not only a retail individual investor.
A retail individual investor would basically main a person subscribing to a maximum of hundred securities or shares in a particular company.
Moving ahead as to what are the safety provisions now apart from allocation in the book building process, a public issue should be kept open for a minimum of three number of days that is a minimum of three working days and a maximum of 10 working days.
It is required to be kept open for revision in price bank then secondly the issuer should make a free issue advertisement in English and Hindi national daily newspaper with a white circulation.
Then the thirdly the minimum application value with reference to the issue of securities should be in the range of rupees 10,000 rupees to rupees 15000 the minimum application value basically means that how much amount of money is the minimum amount to which the investors can subscribe to.
Coming to next the allotment of securities to retail individual investor applicants should be on proportionate basis proportionate bases basically hair signifies that calculating the total number of securities and the number of securities that are asked for by an individual investor in comparison to other investors should be decided on a proportionate basis.
the post issue lead banker should ensure that the money is received in respect of the issue are released to the issuer in compliance with the provisions of section 73 of the Companies Act 2013.
The Lead Banker to an issue is basically a bank with whom all the money of that particular issue or the applications that are received by the public are to be kept at, so that they can be later on release to the issuer.
The merchant banker plays a very important role in the securities market in relation to an IPO coming next the last portion of this particular module where we talk about the types of investors in a public issue.
Investors in a particular issue can be broadly classified into two parts that is the retail investors and the other being institutional investor students whenever we talk about the retail investors they are considered to be either individuals or some group of individuals who wish to subscribe or purchase the shares of a particular company .
The retail investor as such is basically an investor who applies or bids for some specified securities for a value of not more than 200000 rupees.
The examples of individual investors are angel investor that is individuals and group and sweat equity investor.
The retail investors can subscribe as per the regulations under the ICDR regulations a minimum of or not more than basically 200000 rupees.
The institutional investors on the other hand are in the form of investment collectives on behalf of companies through Mutual Funds investment trust etc.
Also it includes and anchor investor or a qualified institutional buyer.
Student’s institutional investors now a day play a very important role in the securities market because they are the people who can subscribe to these issues that is an IPO and FPO in a bulk amount.
The institutional investors are basically companies who are pulling it pulling a lot of money together in order to purchase the securities of a particular company Mutual Funds as such are considered to be a pool of investment or a hybrid form of a security.
Whereby a clubbing of the shares debentures and various other securities is done in order to make it more flexible in order to make it more transparent and more manageable regarding Mutual Funds as well .
The SEBI has laid down the SEBI mutual fund regulations whereby the investment in mutual funds are regulated by SEBI.
In the end students I will like to give you a summary of the module which we have covered which is the part 1 of the issue of capital and disclosure requirements issued by SEBI.
In this particular module students we have discussed and we have talked about the specific guidelines that have been laid down by SEBI, when a public company or when a listed public company that is the issuer comes up with a new issue in the securities market,that is by way of an IPO or an FPO.
In this particular module it is very important for you to understand that what are the practical conditions that have been laid down by SEBI when the company comes up with a new issue in the market The new issue in the market was initially regulated only by the provisions of the Companies Act and which was amended in the year 2013 and to which some recent amendments have also been made out and only regulated by the SEBI Act of 1992.
As to the powers being given to SEBI which is the securities and exchange Board of India.
But now these regulations lay down a proper legal and regulatory Framework whereby these companies that is a listed public company or an issuer is asked mandatorily to follow the guidelines with respect to the promoters contribution in that particular issue.
The pricing of the securities in that particular issue as to on the basis of what the price will be decided .
Also the protection of the interest of investors has been given the prime importance in the ICDR regulations.
In the regulations it has been also get in mind that the investors funds are not being underutilized or they are not simply being taken up by the company and not utilized for the purpose which has been specified in the IPO.
These guidelines with respect to the investor protection have been further strengthened by provisions like ASBA that is the application supported by blocked amount.
Students why ASBA is very important is the basic reason that initially the any transaction in the securities market used to take a lot of time in the clearing of the funds as well as the payment of the money to the particular issuer .
But now a days it has been made very simpler by the ASBA facility that is application supported by blocked amount, whereby the issuer has to specify in the IPO or at the time when the IPO is taken by the issuer.
As to this is considered to be that this particular bank will provide the facility of the application supported by blocked amount that is the application which will be made to a particular Bank for the purpose of ASBA.
In addition to this the price stabilization mechanism has also been laid down by way of the green shoe option which is considered to be a very important mechanism.
Whereby the prices of the securities will be decided on the basis of this process .
In this entire green shoe process or price stabilization process a stabilizing Agent will be appointed by a particular issuer and then he will decide the process of the price of the securities.
In addition to this the promoters contribution that is how much amount or how much percentage of money will a promoter contribute in a particular issue .
That is to be also decided or provided mandatorily by the ICDR regulations .
At least 20% of the issue or the price of the securities which have been laid down in that IPO has to be paid by the promoter .
In the last I have also discussed about the types of the investors that are purchasing or who are subscribing to the securities in the market.
The securities are being subscribed most importantly by two kinds of investors That is the retail investors and the second being the institutional investors.
Institutional investors are basically the companies or institution investing by way of mutual funds or by way of the investment trustees, debenture trustees etc.
That is the companies which are investing into the shares and the other being the retail individual investors that is one or two or maybe group of people subscribing to the securities.
In the second module basically students will be discussing about how the private placement of the securities takes place .
The most basic difference between the private placement of securities and the public issue being that in a public issue the securities are offered to the public at large by way of an IPO or an FPO ,whereas in the private placement of the securities they are being given only to a limited number of people that is to a maximum of 50 people in the securities market.
That is to a maximum of 50 investors in the market.
And they can be basically done by a qualified institutional placement program and institutional placement program etc these will be elaborated in the second module.
I hope the students who are going to this particular module will be able to learn more about the functions of SEBI, because as such the SEBI that is the securities and exchange Board of India, which is the regulator of the securities market has been regulating the market.
The primary and the secondary market which is the classification of our securities market in India by the SEBI Act of 1992 by detailing the functions and the various offences and the various provisions laid down under the SEBI Act, but by these specific regulations the role of SEBI has been further strengthen to keep an eye and to keep a watch on how the companies or how the public companies are to subscribe or to get funds from the people or investors in the market.
Hello Students!
Now we will be discussing about the second module of the ICDR regulations laid down by SEBI in the year 2009.
The Part 2 of this particular regulation will be discussing the issue of a rights issue done by the company that is a public listed company or the issuer.
Then the bonus issue, then qualified institutional program or institutional placement program.
Then issue of Indian depository receipts by the company and in the end we will be also discussing about the issue and listing of debt securities regulations laid down by SEBI in the year 2008.
Students, till now whatever we have discussed in the ICDR regulations talks only about the public issue or the conditions that have been laid down by the ICDR regulations in the case of a public issue that is an IPO on an FPO you taken up by the company.
Now what we will be discussing in the path two of the regulations is basically the placement program that is to be instituted by the issuer in case of private placement of the securities.
Students, it is a very important for you to understand that the difference between a public issue and a private placement of the securities.
The private placement of securities is only a process whereby a selected group of people that is only 50 persons as such to a maximum are given a subscription of a particular securities of the company.
The Companies Act, under Section 23 lays down that a public company can subscribe or get a subscription to the securities of the company either through a public issue that is through an IPO or an FPO or through a private placement of the securities.
The Private placement of the securities can also be done by a public company but in case of a private company it can only come out with the subscription through private placement only.
The private placement process is completely different from the public issue of securities.
Coming to students, the objectives first of all, in this particular module the objective of our study is to understand the conditions and the requirements for various kinds of issues and as well as the conditions and the requirements that are laid down under the regulations for a rights issue, a bonus issue, a QIP that is a Qualified Institutional Placement, institutional placement program, IDRs Etc.
Second objective, students will be to understand the meaning and the features of the rights issue, bonus issue, and the QIP institutional placement program IDRs etc.
The third objective of this particular module will be to understand the conditions and the eligibility requirements that have been laid down under the SEBI issue and listing of debt securities regulations 2008.
These regulations have also been laid down by SEBI which talk about the issue and the listing as well as the continuous listing of the debt securities.
Just as a reference here, students I would tell you that debt securities basically mean the securities which are issued by the company in pursuance of a convertible instrument or a debt instrument that is given by the company to the subscribers or the investors.
Coming to first of all the introduction, the regulatory framework of the securities market in the primary market consists of the issue of securities not only through an IPO or an FPO but it also consists of an issue through our rights issue, bonus issue, private placement etc.
The main elements relating to these issues are laid down under ‘The Companies Act’ of 2013 and the SEBI ICDR regulations of 2009.
The conditions and regulatory requirements relating to such issues have been laid down under the ICDR regulations.
The regulations provide a framework to protect the interest of investors by specifying the mandatory disclosures and the manner of such disclosures.
It also provides for other modes of raising capital by a public company which is neither a public issue nor a right issue but by way of private placement of the securities.
The private placement can be basically divided into three important parts that is a preferential allotment, a Qualified Institutional Placement and Institutional Placement Program.
Then in order to regulate the issue of the debt securities that is debenture or bonds, the regulations on issue and listing of debt securities 2008 have been issued by SEBI.
These regulations provide for conditions to be fulfilled by an issuer while issuing and listing the debt securities either through a public offer for a private placement basis on a recognized stock exchange.
In this, it is very important for a student of Corporate Law to understand that in case of the debt securities whereby the issuing and listing of debt securities is to be done.
It can either be done through a public offer or also through a private placement of the securities on a recognized stock exchange.
Now, students coming first of all the main content of this particular module.
In this module, you will understand first of all the rights issue.
Rights issue basically means an issue of the securities to existing shareholders as on a particular date that is the record date fixed by the issuer.
Students, it is very important to understand that a rights issue is only an issue that is done to the existing investors of a particular company.
All the people who have already subscribed to the securities of the company are given some additional shares by way of a rights issue.
Whereas as in the case of an IPO which we have discussed earlier in the first module the shares were first time to be given to the investors.
Whereas in the case of a rights issue it is considered to be an issue of the securities to the existing shareholders as on a particular date.
For the purpose of determining that particular date by the issuer that is a listed public company.
It is considered to be as the record date in terms of the guidelines.
The rights, in this case the rights issue are offered to the existing shareholders in a particular ratio to the number of securities held as on the record date.
It is very important for you to understand that this particular ratio is to be decided by the issuer only that in which particular ratio, the rights are to be given to the existing shareholders to the particular shareholders of the investors, in other words.
The company offers existing shareholders a right to purchase additional shares at a price lesser than the market price.
The price in case of rights issue is considered to be lesser than the price at which the securities of shares are being given to the public.
In a rights issue to the price determined by the issue will always be lesser than the price which is determined by the market.
A share holder has an option of applying for additional shares but the final decision would rest with the board of directors of a particular company.
Next, coming to the general conditions relating to the rights issue.
A rights issue can be offered through a letter of offer where the aggregate value of the securities offered exceeds Rs.50 lakhs.
As such, in case of a rights issue it should either be an issue been given to the public either for a value of Rs.50 lakhs or more than 50 lakhs.
So the first general condition with respect to rights issue provides us that it can be offered through a letter of offer that is an offer document given to the public or to the investors.
In case, the value exceeds Rs 50 lakhs, then the draft letter of offer has to be filed SEBI through a merchant banker at least 30 days prior to filing it with the designated stock exchange.
The letter of offer or the draft letter of offer basically is the offer document which is considered to be as the prospectus detailing out the terms and conditions that are required to be provided to the investors of a rights issue.
The terms and conditions are basically the prerequisites which are required or which the company on the basis of which will be issuing the securities to investors of the rights issue.
The draft letter has to be filed to the SEBI by way of a merchant banker at least 30 days prior to filing it with the designated stock exchange.
The designated stock exchange, students is considered to be as a platform, stock exchanges a platform where the securities of a company are listed for them to be dealt with in the secondary market and a designated stock change basically means one of the stock exchange where the company is going to list the securities.
A rights issue cannot be made unless form arrangements of Finance through verifiable means towards 75% of the state it means of Finance have been made.
Why it is very important for you to understand this provision students is that until and unless 75% of the form arrangements have been made for financing that particular rights issue, it cannot be offered to the existing shareholders.
Basically, it is providing a minimum cap on a particular issue of being subscribed of finance been provided for that particular issue in case of a rights issue to already being made by the issuer that is the company.
Then the issue shall be open for subscription for a period of 15 days and a maximum period of 30 days.
It is again important for the issuer to ensure that the rights issue remains open for a minimum period of 15 days and a maximum period of 30 days.
It is important to ensure that the issue that the investors or the subscribers get at least 15 days in case they wish to subscribe to the rights issue of that particular company.
Next are, students the specific conditions are the particular eligibility requirements in case of a rights issue.
The eligibility requirements for specific conditions have been classified into four important parts.
The first being the record date.
Secondly, being the letter of offer, then the abridged prospectus and third being the advertisement on the pre issue advertisement that is required to be made by the company and fourth being the restriction on rights issue.
Firstly, I will be discussing as to what is the meaning of the term record date.
Record date basically, students is the date or a particular date on which the issuer order public listed company is coming out with that particular issue.
The issuer making rights issue has to announce a particular date existing on which the eligible securities or the eligible shareholders will be allotted the rights issue.
The issuer it is very important that the issuer shall not withdraw rights issue after the announcement of the record date has been done and if it does so then it cannot withdraw or if it does so it cannot make an application for listing do securities for a period of 12 next month’s basically.
Again, why this time period has been laid down students is to make sure that the record date which has been decided by the issuer in case of a rights issue is not changed time and again by that particular issuer.
If the particular issuer is changing the record date or if there is any kind of change being done by the issuer then it cannot issue the same securities by way of a rights issue for a period of next 12 months.
The second requirement for the conditions laid down for the rights issue is restriction on the rights issue.
A rights issue of equity shares cannot be made if the issuer has outstanding fully or partly convertible debt instruments at the time of making rights issue.
It basically signifies, students that any issuer coming up with the rights issue should not have any kind of fully or partly convertible debt instruments that are pending or to be made at the time to be paid by that particular issued at the time of coming up with the rights issue.
If the issuer has got any of such instruments which are fully or convertible debt instruments that is an instrument which signifies the amount of debt to be paid by that particular company.
If that is there at the time it cannot come up with the rights issue.
Then next is the next eligibility conditions provides for letter of offer pricing and the period of subscription.
The letter of offer along with application form shall be sent to all existing shareholders at least 3 days before the opening of the issue.
Here, it basically signifies students that the letter of offer on the basis of which the issuer is coming up with the rights issue should be given to all the existing shareholders at least 3 days before the date of coming up of the rights issue.
Secondly, the issue price shall be decided before determining the recorded in consultation with the designated stock exchange.
The issue price here signifies students, the price of that particular issue or the price of the securities that are to be given by way of a rights issue.
It has to be decided on consultation with the designated stock exchange.
Then the issuer shall give only 1 of the following payment options to the investors in case of a rights issue, the part payment on application shall not be less than 25% of the issue price and the part payment on application with balance money to be paid in calls.
This signifies that the issuer will have to provide a condition under the rights issue that at least 25% of the amount of money that is to be paid ,can be paid partly and later on the rest can be paid up.
Then full payment on application, if such issue has obtained the necessary regulatory approvals.
That is full payment from the investors or the subscribers of rights issue will be taken by the issuer.
If all the necessary regulatory approvals have already been taken by that particular issuer.
The pre-issue advertisement of the rights issue provides that the following disclosures are required to be made by the issuer of the rights issue.
That is, the first being the date of completion of the dispatch of abridged letter of offer and application form.
Then a statement that the application form can also be directly sent to the issuer by the existing shareholders through the registered post with application money to the issuer.
Then the advertisement shall be made at least in one English and in Hindi daily newspaper and in one regional news paper in that particular area where the company is situated so as to ensure that the advertisement is circulated to all the existing shareholders of that particular company.
It is very important students for the company to disclose that rights issue is been given to the existing shareholders because it is a important opportunity that is being given to the existing shareholders to subscribe to the securities of the additional securities of that particular company.
Next, I will be elaborating about the bonus issue.
Students, first of all you should know what is the most important difference between the rights issue and the bonus issue?Before I start with the bonus issue, it is very important to understand that what is meant by a bonus issue and the basic difference between the 2.
A rights issue is given as I have already told you, is given to the existing shareholders on a particular record date.
The shareholders which was existing on a particular record date on the particular ratio that is being applied by them on the basis of the price that is decided by the company and which is paid by the investors or the existing shareholders.
Whereas students, in case of a bonus issue the thing is that the existing shareholders are given a particular issue of the securities out of the free reserves Auto Share Premium Account of a particular company.
A bonus issue as the term itself suggest, students is basically a issue which is given in addition to the number of the securities that are being held by the existing shareholders of that particular company.
The bonus issue can be defined as an issue of securities to the existing shareholders made by an issuer on a record date without any consideration from the shareholders.
The price of the securities, the price of that particular issue is the most important difference existing between the rights issue and bonus issue.
In case of the rights issue the price is to be paid up by the existing shareholders and on the basis of the price decided by the issuer.
Whereas in case of a bonus issue, it is considered to be that no prices to be paid by the issuers by the existing shareholders of that particular issuer because they are given without any consideration.
They are in addition to the existing shares which are there with the existing shareholders.
The shares are issued in case of bonus shares.
They are issued out of the free reserve or share premium account of a company in a particular ratio to the number of securities held on a record date.
To the number of securities here signifies that the number of shares that are held by the existing shareholders ,they are given securities out of the free reserves of that particular company.
Coming next to the Features of the Bonus Issue.
Bonus issue is basically a conversion of capital of the company to another.
When we say that it is a conversion of capital to another, it basically means that the capital of the company which was existing with the company as it is in the form of free reserves or in the form of profit of that particular company are being subscribed or being given as shares in the form of bonus issue to the existing shareholders.
Secondly, the total resource base of a company is not altered due to the issue of bonus share.
There is no scope of money mobilization from investors into capital structure of a company in the primary capital market.
They are issued by converting the reserves of the company into equity share capital.
Students, equity share capital basically signifies the amount of the capital out of the total share capital of the company which is given for subscription to the people or to the investors.
In case of Bonus and rights issue, it is the existing shareholders of the company.
It can be issued only if the articles of association of a particular company authorize it.
Students, the articles of association of a particular company is basically the most important document because it is the document that signifies that how the internal management or the management of the affairs of the company has to be done.
If the A.O.A of the company signify or provide for such a provision that the bonus issue of the shares can be done only then it can be done by the board of directors of that particular company.
Now, students you will study the conditions for the bonus issue.
The conditions for bonus issue first of all provide that the articles of association of the company must authorized for such a bonus issue and if it is not authorized then the company shall pass a special resolution and the General Body Meeting of the company.
Secondly, it is important that the issuer must not have defaulted in the payment of interest or principal or the fixed deposits or the dead securities issued by it.
Thirdly, the issue has not defaulted in the payment of the dues of the employees which are the mandatory dues like the provident fund, gratuity, etc.
These conditions basically students, provide that when a bonus issue is being issued by the issuer to the existing shareholders, these all obligations of the company should not have been existing on that particular date.
If any kind of obligation with respect to payment of money like gratuity or other employee benefits have not been given by the issuer to the existing share to their employees then it is not permitted for the company to come up with the bonus issue.
Second, the restriction of the bonus issue, the issuer should have should not have fully or partly convertible debt instruments at the time of making the bonus issue.
Secondly, the bonus issue shall be made out of the free reserves that are existing in the company or which are also can be the genuine profits or out of the securities premium collected in cash only that is the free reserves or the securities premium and the bonus shares shall not be issued in lieu of dividend.
In lieu of dividend, basically signifies students, that the dividend is given to the existing shareholders on the number of the shares that is held by them in that company.
If the bonus shares are been given out of the dividend that is being given it is not permitted for the company to do that.
The third condition for a bonus issue is the completion of the bonus issue.
The issuer announcing a bonus issue after the approval of its board of directors shall implement the bonus issue within 15 days from the date of the approval and once the decision to make a bonus issue is announced the issue cannot be withdrawn.
The bonus issue, it is very important that it cannot be withdrawn after it has been announced by the company and it must be also implemented within 15 days from the date when it is approved by the existing board of directors of the company.
In the third part, students, we will be discussing about Private Placement- Concept and Types.
As I have already discussed and told you in the first module that a private placement of the securities means the issue of securities to unlimited number of persons that is a maximum of 50 persons and which is the opposite of a publication issue.
The private placement refers to issue of the shares made by a company to a select group of investors instead of inviting the public at large.
It is basically of three types that is a preferential allotment, secondly qualified institutional placement and the third is institutional placement program.
A preferential issue means a issue of the specified securities to specified persons or group of persons on a private placement basis.
It is considered as a fresh allotment of the shares to promoters, their friends and relatives on a preferential basis, other than raising capital through a public issue, rights issue or a bonus issue.
Coming next to the conditions for a preferential issue.
In order to make sure that the I.C.D.R regulations have been fulfilled, the issuer has to abide or follow the basic conditions for preferential issue laid down under the guidelines.

The electronic form here signifies that the securities now are to be mandatorily kept in a electronic form under the depositories act of 1996 and no hard copy of the securities should be there.
Then the issuer must be in compliance with the conditions for continuous listing of equity shares as specified in the listing agreement with the recognized stock exchange where the equity shares are listed.
Next, coming to what is a Qualified Institutional Placement? The Qualified Institutional Placement is basically a placement of the securities that is done to a limited number of people.
The features of a Qualified Institutional Placement are- the aggregate of the proposed QIP and all previous QIPs made by the issuer in the same financial year shall not exceed 5 times the net worth of the issued as per the audited balance sheet of the previous financial year.
Secondly, the tenure of the convertible or exchangeable eligible securities issued through QIP shall not exceed 60 months from the date of allotment.

Then, the QIP shall be made on the basis of a placement document which I’ll contain all material information.
Lastly a copy of the placement documents shall be filed with the SEBI for its record within 30 days of the allotment of eligible securities.
Next we will be discussing students about the Institutional Placement Program.
An Institutional Placement Program means a further public offer of eligible securities by an eligible seller in which the offer allocation and the allotment of such securities is made only to the qualified institutional buyers.
It is very important for you to understand students that, in a Institutional Placement Program only the QIBs that is the Qualified Institutional Buyers are further given the securities of that particular company.
You can say that it is an extension of the qualified institutional placement program that has been done by the company.
The important conditions for an IPP that is in Institutional Placement Program are that it must have been made only after passing a special resolution by the shareholders of the issuer in terms of section 63 of the Companies Act 2013.
Secondly, no partly paid up securities shall be offered.
Thirdly, the issuer shall obtain and in principle approval from the stock exchange.
Coming next to what is the meaning of an Indian Depository Receipt? An Indian Depository Receipt means an instrument in the form of a depository receipt created by a Domestic Depository in India against the underlying equity shares of the issuing company incorporated outside India.
Basically, in case of an Indian Depository receipt, it is a receipt which is created by the domestic depository as provided.
Domestic Depository is also a company provided under the depositaries act of 1996 and created against the underlying equity shares of the company incorporated outside India that is a foreign company not incorporated in India.

I’m Deepika Prakash, from National Law University Delhi and this presentation is about other laws effecting companies under the Corporate Law.
This presentation will elaborate on laws other than Companies Act 2013 ,which have an impact on the companies that function in India.
The major focus of this presentation is to give an overview of all such laws and their respective provisions which have a consequence on the functioning of a company form of organization in India.
Company form of organization is by far one of the most ingenious and successful business organizations worldwide.
Over the years it has taken complex forms evolved to suit the needs and objectives of various businesses while maintaining its basic characteristics like, limited liability and perpetual succession.
Which are one of the appealing features as compared to other forms of business organizations like sole proprietorship and partnership? The history of regulating companies in India starts with the Joint Stock Company Act of 1850, which was subsequently replaced by the Act of 1857 more in line with the English Companies Act of 1855.
The first comprehensive Indian Companies Act was passed in the year 1866, which was amended on several occasions.
Subsequently, based on the Bhabha Committee report India passed the act of 1956.
Now, as corporate India continues to evolve at a lightning speed it is imperative that all the diversion Ranger stock whole stakeholders in it a well protected and represented.
In India company form of business in all its kinds are primarily regulated by the Companies Act 2013, which has recently substituted its predecessor that is the act of 1956.
The new act deals with various dimensions of companies giving detailed provisions for the regulation and compliance and raised the bar on governance.
However, companies in India are regulated by other diverse laws as well and the intertwining of these laws create a dynamic structure of regulations which makes corporate environment more transparent simple and globally acceptable.
Some of these laws are, the Banking Regulation Act of 1949, the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act 1992, the Securities Contract Regulation Act of 1956, the securitisation and reconstruction of financial assets and enforcement of securities interest act of 2002, the competition Act of 2002, the Foreign Management Exchange Act of 1999, the Insurance Act 1938, the Income Tax Act of 1961, then there are various labor laws, various Intellectual Property Rights, various environmental laws and finally the latest law the limited liability Partnership Act of 2008.
Let us briefly discuss them.
The first law that affects companies in India is the Banking Regulation Act of 1949.
It is the main law regulating banking in India.
However, this Act does not purport to codify the law on banking.
It merely lays down the regulations for the functioning of the banking companies and cooperation.
In addition to those already presented in the Companies Act.
Now, there are three types of banks in India.
First, are the Nationalised banks, like the State Bank of India and the Bank of Baroda.
Second, other banking companies which include private banks like ICICI and HDFC.
It also includes foreign banks, like, Citibank and finally there are cooperative banks, like; the Cosmos Bank.
Now, what does banking mean? The business of Banking in India means that the Bank must have three features: first, the ability to receive money as deposits, second, the ability to honor customer’s cheque and thirdly, ability to grant loan.
If a company does not carry out all these functions then it will not be called a bank.
The part two of the Banking Regulation Act of 1949, defines and Lays down the business of banking companies.
Section six elaborates on various forms of business in which such companies may engaging.
Few such activities are: first, borrowing raising or taking up of money, the lending or advancing of money either upon or without security.
Second, bills of exchange, hundies, promissory notes, coupons, draught, bill of lading, Railway receipts, warrants and other instruments and securities weather transferable or negotiable or not .
Third, providing a safety deposit vault, the collecting and transmitting of money and securities .
Fourth, the effecting, ensuring, guaranteeing, underwriting, participating, in managing and carrying out of any issue public or private companies.
Now, the act further lays down rules regarding appointment of board of directors and the chairman, licensing of a banking company; its capital, its loans and advances and the Reserve Bank of India’s power on banking company to name of you.
Therefore a company which is interested in starting banking functions must be well worth with these regulations.
Now, the Securities and Exchange Board of India is constituted in accordance with the provisions of the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act of 1992.
The Act states the functioning of SEBI to be first to protect the interest of investors in the security market, to protect the development off, and to regulate the security market itself.
Therefore SEBI is the regulator of the securities and exchange market of India.
The Act is divided generally into various chapters and these chapters mostly deal with the establishment of SEBI, the powers and functions of the board, prohibition of manipulation and deception devices, insider trading and provisions regarding substantive acquisition of securities.
The Act also lays down penalties for the contravention of the act, SEBI’s power of adjudication and establishment jurisdiction as well as procedure for the securities appellate tribunal.
Now, moving on to another law, the Securities Contract Regulation Act 1956 is another vital legislation which is applicable and effects companies in India where the securities are listed on stock exchanges.
The object of the Act is to prevent undesirable transactions in securities by regulating the business of dealing in it.
The Act lays down provisions for creation and recognition of stock exchanges, contracts in securities and listing of securities in stock exchanges.
The aim is to keep the functioning of the stock market transparent and to prevent undesirable contract in security market through due process of recognition and continued supervision.
Now, this Act can be measured divided into two parts: first, relates to recognising of stock exchanges and second, relating to penalties and procedure under the Act.
Coming to another law, which is the great significance to a company in India is the Competition Act 2002.
This Act replaced the monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Act of 1969 and as it was found to be insufficient with the needs of the growing Indian economy after liberalization.
The Act has objects: as first, to prevent practices having adverse effect on the competition, second to promote and sustain competition in the market, third to protect the interest of consumers and fourth to ensure freedom of trade in the market.
The Act establishes the Competition Commission of India and its function is to regulate three aspects regarding competition.
They are: first, prohibition of certain agreement under section three of the competition Act 2002.
Under this provision any agreement made by an enterprise or group which is made in respect of production, supply, distribution, acquisition or control of goods of provisions of services which causes or is likely to cause an appreciable adverse effect within India is prohibited.
Such agreements are called anti-competitive agreements.
Second regulation is regarding abuse of dominance under section 4.
This provision prohibits abuse of dominant position by any enterprise or group which will have an appreciable adverse effect on the market, and final is a regulation of combinations under Section 5 as well as section 6 of the company of the competition Act 2002.
Under it mergers and acquisitions which made the specified turnover or asset based test laid down in the Act itself ,have to be notified so as to regulate them from hampering the competition in the market.
Coming to another law which a company operating in India messed adhere to is the Foreign Exchange Management Act 1999.
Now, this Act was enacted to basically promote the foreign exchange market in India.
It repealed the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act of 1963.
By this new law a paradigm shift has occurred in the Foreign Exchange Policy of India.
Earlier, it was about control and regulation of all external transaction.
But now, it has been replaced to management of the foreign exchange for better capital inflow.
Now, FEMA Act of 1999 lays down rules regarding dealings in foreign exchange, holding a foreign exchange, foreign securities and any immovable property outside India, current and capital account transaction in foreign exchange through a person authorise under the act, export of goods and services, realisation and repatriation of foreign exchange to mention a few.
Now, the Act further lays down certain penalties for the contravention of the above rules.
Now coming to another law; the business of insurance is regulated in India under the Insurance Act of 1938.
The companies which are engaged in providing insurance have to comply with the provisions under this act.
This is a comprehensive Act relating to matters of insurance company.
Now, this tax is levied on the strength of an Act called the Income Tax Act, which was passed by the Parliament of India in the year 1961.
The income tax Act is one of the core laws, which every company in India has to comply with.
Now, the income earned in India is not limited to Income earned within the geographic limits or the boundaries of the country.
Certain incomes are also Deemed to have been earned in India although they may have been and outside the country.
The Income Tax Act lays down various rules relating to resident, for the purpose of taxes in India, special tax provisions for SEZs, deductions, computation of total income as well as offences under the Act and penalties for contravention of the rules.
It also establishes a tax income tax authority for carrying out the provisions under this Act.
Hence, a company in India also has to be aware of the Income Tax Act.
Now, India introduced a new form of business organisation by the enactment of the Limited Liability Partnership Act 2008.
An LLP of the Limited Liability Partnership combines the flexibility of a partnership and the advantages of limited liability of a company at a low compliance cost.
LLP therefore provides its members the flexibility of organising the internal management on the basis of a mutually arrived agreement as it is in the case of a partnership firm.
The LLP form of business vehicle is useful for small as well as medium enterprises.
Now, the main features of the Limited Liability Partnership Act of 2008 can be briefly state to be firstly, the Indian Partnership Act is not applicable to LLPs.
Second, the LLP has a body corporate and a separate legal entity from its partners.
Third, the mutual rights and duties of partners inter see in an LLP and those rights and duties.
The LLP and partners are governed by an agreement of provisions under the Limited Liability Act of 2008.
Fourthly, every LLP must have two partners and two individuals as designated partners of whom at least one must be a resident in India.
Therefore, any company or LLP must be well versed and comply with this Act of 2008.
Now, another set of laws that a company specially and industry must comply with other countries labor laws.
These labor legislations regulate various aspects of the relationship between employers and employees in an industry.
It regulates the health and safety of its workers, minimum employment requirements, employees rights to name a few.
It is important for the corporate India to be aware of these labor legislation as they have direct consequence on the working and regulation of the company.
The term ‘labor’ here refers to any productive work especially physical work done for wages.
I will discuss now very briefly the main labor laws in India.
The very first and most important labor legislation is an Industrial Dispute Act of 1947.
The statement and object of this act, is to make provisions for the investigation and settlement of industrial disputes.
The Industrial Dispute Act of 1947 was enacted to make provisions for investigation and settlement of industrial disputes and for providing certain safeguards to the Act work.
The Act contains about 40 sections which deal with defining an industry, industrial dispute; lay off, lockout, retrenchment, trade union, strike, wages and workmen.
It provides machinery for investigating and settlement of disputes through works committee, conciliation officers Board of Conciliation, courts of enquiry, labor courts, tribunal and voluntary arbitration.
It also lays down provisions for reference of dispute for adjudication.
Payment of wages to workers; during pendency of proceedings in the High Court are also dealt with under the Industrial Dispute Act.
Then, what are the rights of appeal, settlement in or outside conciliation, notice of change in employment conditions, protection of workmen during the pendency of preceding, strike and lockout procedure, lay off compensation, retrenchment compensation, proceedings for retrenchment and various penalties for contravention of the provisions under this Act.
Now, another important legislation is the employees State Insurance Act of 1948.
This is a social welfare legislation, enacted by the parliament to achieve the socio-economic justice and strength in the Directive Principles of State Policy under the constitution of India.
Its primary purpose is to provide relief to the employees in case of maternity, injury during the course of employment as well as a time of sickness.
In such situations, employees receive medical relief, cash benefits, maternity benefits, dependence of deceased workers; receive pension and compensation for fatal other injuries and diseases.
It also establishes the employees State Insurance Corporation.
Now coming to another labor welfare legislation.
It is the Workman Compensation Act of 1923.
The Worksmen Compensation Act 1923 aims to provide workman as well as the dependent, reliefs in case of accidents arising out of an in course of employment which has caused the death or disablement of workman.
This Act is to be noted does not cover workers under the Employees State Insurance Act.
The reason for exclusion is that they are already covered under the SEPRO Act.
Now, let’s see some of the main provisions of the workmen compensation Act of 1923.
The Act deals with defining of a workman, disablement then under what circumstances employer is liable to compensate, provisions regarding accidents arising out of and in course of employment and provisions regarding the amount of compensation to be paid in various circumstances.
Now, the final labor law that we will look at today is a factories Act 1948.
The primary object of the Act is to secure safety measures in the factories for the health and welfare of its workers as well as create a system of approval method for starting of factories.
The major provisions this Act can be said to be: first that the Act defines what factories are? Then, it lays down safety and health measures, it lays down working hours, what are the overtime wages because of workman, facilities; which are to be provided in large factories, provisions on women factory workers, rules of employment of children in factories and also how to deal with, with hazardous processes in a particular factory.
Coming to another set of interesting laws that a company engaged in creation of Intellectual Property Right or the IPR, the laws relating to IPRs to such companies a very crucial.
These are rights granted to the creator, a owner of works which are results of human intellect and creativity.
This could be literary, musical, software, industrial, brand names or scientific.
World Trade Organization is the primary international body in the field of IPR.
It has laid down standards to be followed by its member nations on the following areas: first is the patent, second is the trademark, third copyright then there is geographical indication, industrial designs, layout designs and integrated circuits and plants varieties.
Let us look at a few main laws out of these that have been established in India.
First is the Patent Act of 1970.
Patents are exclusive rights granted to the owner of an invention.
These rights include right to create, use and market these inventions in India.
These rights imply that no one else can manufacture, use or market the same products for the period which the patent has been granted.
This Act lays down the procedure for application and grant of patent and other matters connected to it.
It also creates a controller of Patents as well as patent offices in various places in India.
The Act also lays down issue compulsory licenses.
Now the second and important intellectual property right law is that ‘The Trademark Act’.
The Trademark Act of 1999 is something that a company must be aware of under which ,any sign or any combination of science capable of distinguishing the goods or services of any one undertaking from those of other undertaking may be registered and protected from infringement.
The Act creates a central trademark registry for this purpose.
It also lays down the procedure for the duration of registration, rights guaranteed after registration, assignment and transmission of such rights.
Another pertinent law under the Intellectual Property Rights that a company must be aware of is ‘The Copyright Act’ of 1957.
Under this Act, works having a degree of originality are entitled to get copyrighted.
Such works are original, literary, dramatic, artistic or musical works, sound recordings in films and the typographical arrangement of published editions.
Now the rights which are granted to the owners under the Act are: right to copy the work, rent or lend the work to the public, perform show or play the work in public, broadcast the work including electronic transmissions.
These rights under the Copyright Acts are granted to the owner for a specific duration which is mentioned under the Act itself.
In case the work is copied during that time period by someone without the permission, the owner can bring an action against the infringement under the Act.
Now the rapid economic and industrial growth in India in the last few decades has raised the issue on environmental protection as well.

I am Dr. Risham Garg of National Law University Delhi.
I shall be discussing the essentials of the corporate insolvency legislative Framework in India.
In the absence of a unified common framework of corporate insolvency laws, corporate insolvency relies immensely on a series of debt recovery laws, administrative orders, judicial decisions, debt recovery laws include primarily for legislations.
Companies Act 2013 and Old Companies Act of 1956, the SICA 1985, the SARFAESI act of 2002 and the RDDBFI Act of 1993.
This myriad of legislations have been recognized unanimously as for the delaying the process of insolvency and bankruptcy in India.
Which is further effected by a variety of forum enjoying jurisdiction such as the High Court's the BIFR, the CLB, the DRT’s.
This has led to plummeting foreign investments in India and its abysmal standing in the World Bank's ease of doing business index 2015 on the ease of resolving insolvencies.
Now what are the legislations mainly dealing with the corporate insolvency and restructuring in India.
Under the SICA industrial companies whose net worth has eroded by hundred percent as are identified as being in distress and a reference to the BIFR.
There after the BIFR must investigate the potential viability of the industrial company and then either recommends its rehabilitation scheme or winding up before the High Court.
SARFAESI, the act provides mechanism to the secured creditor to take possession of the property of the data without intervention of the courts or tribunals.
Appeals against such position may be made to the DRT.
RDDBFI, this act focus is specially on the easing, recovery for banks and other financial institutions both secured and unsecured creditors.
The act additionally provided for the establishment of DRT’s and the DRAT’s.
As mentioned above a host of legislation and forum combined with potentially conflicting jurisdictional issues has resulted in systemic delays and complexities in the insolvency and bankruptcy process.
Additionally all these legislatives have been identified as being inadequate in by themselves and it would be pertinent to discuss a few issues relating to the same.
First let us start with the SICA and its problems.
The functioning of SICA has been at the receiving end of immense criticism with judicial pronouncements further complicating and worsening matters.
Delays further contribute to the further issues such as debtors used the delay to defer payments to the creditors because of the moratorium that is placed upon creditor enforcement.
Corporate assets have often been siphoned off during the long drawn process.
The managers coerce creditors into extending further finance or end-up extracting concessions as a result of the delays and the obstacles that lie in the path of debt recovery.
In the past high courts have received several frivolous applications of judicial review of BIFR decisions and they have often strayed beyond the limits of Judicial review and have engaged with the merits of the case.
Moreover the efficiency and overburdening of official liquidator are also responsible for causing delays.
SICA is capable of achieving a swift liquidation where creditors rejected possibility of revival.
For instance a company moving relatively swiftly through the BIFR was able to obtain a liquidation opinion being issued in under one year.
In proper identification of companies that can be restructured.
It has been repeatedly stated that the BIFR has failed satisfactorily identify the restructurable companies or sanction feasible schemes.
Which has severely hampered the creditors interest.
SICA does not assist to the creditor.
It has been observed that the High Courts have often sent cases back to the BIFR to conduct enquiry into rehabilitation.
The High Court have does not followed the text of the SICA which says that they shall give effect to winding up orders of BIFR.
The Kanoria Jute Industries Limited vs. The Appellate Authority.
In this case there were two writ petitions challenging the BIFR liquidation opinion.
The company had been registered under the act in 1987 and the opinion of BIFR was issued in 2002 and was affirmed by the appellate authority in 2005.
After one more rehabilitation attempt.
The Calcutta High Court permitted the remaining case back to the BIFR based on the ground that the new parties were interested in rehab.
This was done on the basis that it will greatly serve the cause of the workers and employees of the company.
The interest of the creditor was not given due importance and the opposition to such remission was rejected.
Then debtor is in control during companies revival.
The process followed in SICA as such that the debtor is in control of the company when attempts are being made to revive it.
This often goes against the interest of the creditors.
No winding up orders can be passed by BIFR.
If the BIFR opines that liquidation is required.
It has to forward such opinion to the state High Courts to given effect.
It has interim powers to order sale of assets and receiving court is bound to give effects to such opinion.
The act provides that the High Court shall on the basis of the opinion order winding up.
The most important judicial innovation that has been done is enabling companies to explore, rehab after the issuance of a liquidation opinion by the BIFR.
This relief is often given on an interim basis.
This option is given not on the basis of any finding of error on the part of BIFR rather it is given on an ad hoc based on merits.
Now let us take up the SARFAESI Act and the problems associated with the enforcement of the SARFAESI Act.
The Supreme Court by providing the DRT’s the right to set aside still affected by the creditor seems to have defeated the objective of the SARFAESI Act.
In some of its earlier decisions however in some recent decisions, in the recent decision in 2016 the matter has been settled and the priority of the SARFAESI Act has been established.
Previously it had the held that the DRT is on appeal can look into claims and counterclaims essentially opening doors to heightened intervention, which defeats the principle of non intervention.
Section 17 of SARFAESI Act 2002 provides for the right of appeal against the action initiated by the bank under the provisions of the SARFAESI Act of 2002.
The possession notice issued under section 13 subsection 4 of the SARFAESI Act can be challenged by the borrower or anyone aggrieved within a specified time limit.
On the other hand the judiciary has held that each measure initiated by the bank under the four mentioned section may be challenged by the borrower as a matter of right.
Thereby making the time limit mentioned above redundant.
Let us now take the some problems of the RDDBFI Act.
The whole purpose of the RDDBFI Act has remained unfulfilled despite creation of specialized revenues failing to help banks recover the dues on time due to significant delays.
The absence of any legal provision for facilitating, securitization of financial assets and that the banks did not possess the power to take possession of securities created in their favour adds to the problem.
There is an evident lack of clear and consistent interpretation of several issues by the chord which has led to greater confusion.
The problems while existent in the legislations themselves are compound when they are viewed with each other.
Conflict between SICA, SARFAESI Act and the RDDBFI Act.
Section 22 of SICA has led to a host of conflicts between the provisions of SICA and those of debt enforcement statutes.
This section imposes a moratorium of enforcement once a request is made to the BIFR.
This concern is reflected in the amendment to section 15 sub section 1 of SICA, which was made by passing the SARFAESI Act.
According to weight reference could not be made to the BIFR under SICA.
If a creditor had comments enforcement action under the SARFAESI.
In addition any reference that had already been made to BIFR would have to update if three fourth in value of the creditors decided to take enforcement action under SARFAESI Act.
Yet there has been a number of judgments where this conflict has a reason, for example a pertinent dispute arose as to whether the public interest in recovering debts due to banks and financial institutions is to give way to the public interest in rehab of sick units.
It was held that the debt recovery from a sick units take importance over returns to revive it.
Hence SARFAESI Act will gain precedence.
Hence despite of provisions of SICA, a secured creditor of a sick industry can seek records in the SARFAESI Act.
In contrast if at least 60% of the secured creditors don't agree to exercise the right to realize their security under the SARFAESI Act, then the provisions of SICA would prevails.
Finally SICA proceedings cannot be preceded with where secured creditors representing not less than 75% in value of the outstanding loan decides to enforce their security under the SARFAESI Act.
Conflicting jurisdiction, judgments and parallel proceedings.
In the case of Kritika Rubber Industries vs. Canara Bank, parallel proceedings in the DRT and the Karnataka High Court with a group of secured creditors approaching the DRT and another filing a winding up petition in the High Court resulted in completely opposite decisions.
The HC ordered winding up of debtor and appointed official liquidator.
The DRT whereas the DRT favoured the creditors and ordered attachment of property securing the debt which was subsequently sold in auction.
The official liquidator sought and order to set aside the sale by auction ordered by the DRT.
High court held that disposal of property were to be carried out in association with the official liquidator upon filing of winding up.
According to the DRT simultaneous proceedings under the SARFAESI and RDDBFI are allowed with request to SARFAESI Act not being prohibited during pendency of proceedings during RDDBFI Act and vice versa.
The Patna High Court had in contrast quite held the opposite that proceedings under the RDDBFI Act could not be initiated if the SARFAESI enforcement action had begun.
In reconsolidated steel and alloys the Delhi High Court was unable to issue a winding up order following the BIFR’s reference.
Thus the creditors to file a separate winding up petition.
While the BIFR’s order was made in 1998.
The HC issued a winding up order only in 2005 because of a winding up petition that was filed by a creditor in 2002.
Such delays cause depletion in the value of the debtors assets and dilute any recovery that creditors might otherwise have been able to obtain.
The multi layered insolvency law framework has given rise to conflicts and multiple proceedings.
These proceedings direct us to understand that we urge to have unified bankruptcy code which can be made applicable to each and every aspect of a company in distress and also for all stakeholders.
Now I would like to discuss a case note on the Pegasus Arc V Haryana Concast Ltd.
This is a recent Supreme Court judgment of 2016.
Overview of facts.
The matter in the landmark case of Pegasus Asset Reconstruction Private Limited vs Haryana Concast Limited arose out of the Companies Act 1956, the SARFAESI Act 2002 and the apparent conflict between them.
Specifically section 529A and section 529 of the Companies Act and section 13 of SARFAESI Act.
The judgment dealt with the 4 cases that were clubbed together after conflict in judgments were passed on the matter by the Punjab and Haryana High court and the Delhi High Court.
Section 529A of the Companies Act of 1956, section 529 of the companies act provides the dues owed to the workmen shall be deemed to be Pari passu with the charge imposed by secured creditors on the company in case the creditors choose to enforce the security through insolvency laws.
Additionally disparity between the claims of workmen and creditors must be affected by the official liquidator appointed for the winding up of the company who shall represent the workmen in winding up proceedings and thereby enforce their charge.
Section 529A then provides that in a scenario that the secured creditors attempt to realize that charge during winding up that is through sale by the official liquidator then the dues owed to the workmen shall be paid first and foremost and thereafter the secured creditor can claim their dues.
On the other hand section 13 of SARFAESI Act provides a secured creditor within alibi within ability to enforce his or her charge or security interest without the intervention of courts or tribunals by taking possession of the secured property or taking control of the management of the defaulting business.
What were the issues pleaded in this case.
As a consequence of the provisions of the companies act the company judge imposed certain restrictions on the enforcement of security interest by a secured creditor under the SARFAESI Act so as to ensure a compliance under section 529 and Section 529A of the companies act.
The Delhi High Court found these restrictions to be in conflict with the SARFAESI Act, while the Punjab and Haryana High Court had held that the company judge could in fact place such restrictions.
Now what were the two pertinent issues, that were raised in the case.
First, whether any power can be exercised by the company court, directly or through an official liquidator, in relation to the sale of a secured asset by a secured creditor in accordance with the provisions and rights stipulated to the creditor under the SARFAESI Act.
Second whether a later offer a bettering the previous sale price in an auction is valid.
The reasoning of the High Court's.
The two High Courts chose very different lines of reasoning and argumentation incoming to diametrically opposite conclusion with regards to the relationship between companies act and SARFAESI Act and the priority to be afforded to secured creditors vis a vis a workmen.
First the Delhi High Court.
The arguments advanced by Pegasus.
1. Pegasus argued that SARFAESI Act was a complete act in itself and has to be interpreted as a standalone code without any reliance taken from the companies act.
2. Non intervention by the courts and tribunals formed an essential part of the act which was clear from the non obstante clauses present before most section of the act.
3.The framework provided for the enforcement of secured assets and the non obstante clause provided for the SARFAESI Act not only reflect the fact that the act is a complete code in by itself but also that in situation of conflict with other law the act being the specialized legislation the field would then have an overriding effect with the other law.
4.Other statutes as provided for in section 37 of the act, such as the companies act only complement and supplement the provisions of the SARFAESI Act.
As these acts are only subsidiary to the SARFAESI Act, they may be relied upon only in so far as their consistent and not contradictory to the provisions of the SARFAESI Act.
Now what was the judgment of the Delhi High Court.
The judgment of the Delhi High Court gave great way to the afore said arguments presented by Pegasus and made two main conclusions as to its judgment.
1. First the court first held that the association of an official liquidator with the sale of secured assets of winding up business would result in defeating the purpose of the SARFAESI Act which envisaged minimal judicial intervention and sought to provide secured creditors with an efficacious remedy.
2. Secondly additionally and quite conclusively the court held that the SARFAESI Act is a complete code in itself.
This means that the rules and provisions given under the act would prevail over any other legislation, in the case the companies act in the case of conflict.
Now what was your decision by the Punjab and Haryana High Court.
The Punjab and Haryana High Court on the other hand took a different approach and allowed for fretters to be put in by the company judge on the sale of secured assets by secured creditors so as to ensure Pari passu treatment of workmen.
The court relied upon the case of Rajasthan state financial corporation variant was held that a financial corporation had the right to proceed against a debtor in accordance with the provisions of section 29 of the SFC Act only if so long is there was no order of finding pind finding the past against the debtor company.
Finally the Punjab and Haryana High Court referred to the Employees Provident Fund Commissioner vs. OL case.
This case dealt with the dues payable by an employer under section 11 of the EPF Act 1952 and the conflict with section 529A of the Companies Act.
It was held that section 529A has a priority over the case of the companies act.
The SARFAESI Act took care the interest of the workmen through its own provisions by means of association of official liquidator with the proceedings before the DRT under the RDB act.
Similar interpretation must be taken in contents of the SARFAESI Act as well as other reason being so that section 13 requires notice to the borrower at various stages.
So the Punjab and Haryana High Court thus going by the past direction taken by a few high courts and perhaps a welfare intent set it in favour of workmen held in situations of conflict.
The workman will be held Pari passu with the companies act.
Now what was the decision of the Supreme Court analysis.
The apex court started with the opinion of the Delhi High Court and granted priority to the SARFAESI Act in coming to the decision.
The court relied on several factors and thereby give the following issues.
The reasons provided by the Supreme Court were firstly that there existed no inconsistency between the companies act and the SARFAESI Act as Section 529A of the companies act was specifically mentioned in section 13 sub section 9 of the SARFAESI Act.
Secondly the intent behind the passing of the SARFAESI Act was minimal judicial intervention in ensuring that the secured creditor could enforce its security interest as provided for in section 13.
The act also ensures that in case of any grievance the liquidator will have the right of seeking redressal under section 17 or 18 of the SARFAESI Act.
The respondents had failed to show that there existed ambiguity in the SARFAESI Act, which required reliance upon the provisions of the Companies Act.
The court then went on to compare the three legislations taken into consideration by the Punjab and Haryana high court.
That is the SFC Act, the RDDBFI Act, then the SARFAESI Act.
Upon a comparison the court found that while the first two acts could be surpassed by the companies act.
The SARFAESI Act is the complete code in itself and the reasons provided were section 9 and 13 of the SARFAESI Act strongly indicate that for the enforcement of the security interest of the secured creditor was provided for exhaustively and with the detailed procedure within section 9 and 13 of SARFAESI Act and the same was to be effected with minimum intervention of the court or tribunal.
Moreover the proviso to section 13 sub section 9 provided for detailed instructions being mindful of the provisions of section 529 and 529A of the Companies Act in 1956.
The proceedings under RDDFI Act have been previously up held by the Judiciary to prevail over the laws as it was a law enacted later in time, while section 529 was amended by the insertion of section 529A in 1925 and workmen's dues preference over the dues.
However the RDDBFI Act was passed in 1993 and therefore acted as a priority legislation over companies act.
The SARFAESI Act rules framed under SARFAESI Act also required that notice be given to the borrower or his agent at different stages.
Thus the rules ensure that oral has the knowledge of the proceedings under the SARFAESI Act.
In case the borrower happens to be a company under winding up.
Now reconciling the SARFAESI and the companies act.
Several provisions within the SARFAESI Act itself insure protection of the interest of workmen and enable them to realize that use without any association of the official liquidator.
The act provides the liquidator to raise an appeal to the DRT in situation where the liquidator is not satisfied with the remedies provided to the workmen.
Additionally a further appeal under section 18 is also envisaged as a further safeguard.
Several protections are already present in the legislative scheme to ensure adequate safeguards to workmen and the same can be achieved without providing further powers to company code or the official liquidator to interfere in the sale of secured assets.
There is thus no need to borrow anything from the companies act till the stage the secured assets are sold by the secured creditors in accordance with the provisions in the SARFAESI Act and the rules.
Furthermore even in accordance with the provisions, the rights of the workmen are protected by sub section 9 of section 13 and its five provisions.
Thus the necessary provisions of the companies act has been incorporated in the SARFAESI Act to protect the interest of workmen and also achieve harmony between the two acts.
Therefore the company judge cannot interfere in proceeding by a secured creditor to realize its secured interest as per provisions of the SARFAESI Act.
Now I will discuss in brief regarding the institutions in the involved in insolvency process, namely the insolvency professional agencies and the insolvency professionals.
The insolvency professionals play a central role in the effective and efficient implementation of an insolvency law with certain powers of debtors and their assets and the duty to protect those assets and their value as well as the interest of creditors.
And employees and to ensure that the law is applied effectively and impartially.
Though the design of an insolvency law and the respective roles assigned to participants.
Insolvency laws adopt a variety of approaches for example to the relationship between the insolvency representative and the court in particular to the delineation of power between them.
As well as to the roles the creditors might play in overseeing certain decisions of the insolvency and wrap and another issues such as remuneration and even removal from office.
Insolvency professional agencies, the insolvency and bankruptcy code of 2016 provides for registration by board of insolvency professional agencies.
Hereafter refer to as insolvency agencies, having insolvency professionals registered with the board as its members.
An insolvency professional agency is defined in the court as any person registered with the board under section 201 of the code as an insolvency professional agency.
An insolvency agency may be a person which includes the following: An individual, a Hindu undivided family, a company, a trust, partnership, a limited liability partnership and any other entity established under the statute.
The person includes a person resident outside India, a person resident outside India means a person other than a person resident in India.
And a person resident in India has the same meaning as assigned to such term in clause 5 of section 2 of the Foreign Exchange Management Act of 1999.
Now can an individual be registered as an insolvency agency? It appears that a foreign entity can be registered as an insolvency agency.
Function of the insolvency professional agencies.
what are the functions of the insolvency professional agencies? The main functions of insolvency professional agency are: Grant of membership to persons who fulfill all requirements set out in its bye-laws on payment of membership fee, lay down standards of professional conduct for its members, monitor the performance of its members, safeguarding the rights privileges and interest of insolvency professionals who are its members.
Suspend or cancel the membership of insolvency professionals who are its members on the grounds set-out in its by-laws, redress the grievances of consumers against insolvency professionals who are its members.
And publish information about its function list of its members, performance of its members and other such information as may be specified by the regulations in this regard.
Registration of insolvency agencies by the board.
An application for registration to be made to the board.
The form and manner particulars of the application and fee for the registration shall be specified by the regulations.
Every insolvency professional agency must have bye laws consistent with the model bye laws, specified by the board and the provisions of the court and the regulations framed there under.
If the board is satisfied that the application confirm through all requirement specified in the regulations.
The applicant shall be granted a certificate of registration and under such terms and conditions as be specified.
Otherwise the application shall be rejected by an order.
Giving the opportunity of being heard to the applicant.
Sub section 20 of section 3 of the code defines an insolvency professional agency is defined as any person registered with the board under section 201 of the code as an insolvency professional agency.
Other offences and penalties under section 68 to sections 77.
If any officer of the corporate debtor within the 12 months immediately preceding the insolvency commencement date is found to have committed any of the offences in these sections.
He shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than 3 years but which may extend to 5 years or with fine which shall not be less than 1 lakh rupees but may extend to 1 crore rupees or with both.
Another provision is a person shall not be liable to any punishment if he proves that he had no intent to defraud or to conceal the state of affairs of the corporate debtor.
If or on the insolvency commencement date and officer of the corporate debtor commits any of the following offences: He shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than 3 years but which may extend to 5 years or with fine.
Which shall not be less than 1 lakh rupees or may extend to 1crore rupees or both.
Now I will discuss with the cross border insolvency arrangements with other countries as provided in section 234 of the insolvency and bankruptcy code of 2016.
The central government may enter into an agreement with the government of any country outside India for enforcing the provisions of the court.
The central government may by notification in the official gazette direct that the application of provisions of the court in relation to assets or property of corporate debtor or debtor, including a personal guarantor of a corporate debtor.
As the case may be situated at any place in a country outside India with which reciprocal arrangements have been made shall be subject to such conditions as may be specified.
There is also a provision for letter of request to a country which may be issued.
If in the courts of insolvency resolution process or liquidation or bankruptcy proceedings as the case may be the resolution, professional, liquidator or bankruptcy trustee as the case may be is of the opinion that assets of the corporate debtor or debtor including a personal guarantor of a corporate debtor are situated in a country outside India with which reciprocal arrangements have been made under section 234.
He may make an application to the NCLT or DRT as the case may be that evidence or action relating to such assets is required in connection with such process or proceeding.
On receipt of such an application the NCLT may issue a letter of request to a court or an authority of such country competent to deal with such request.
Now I have discussed in this module. 
We have covered the aspects of the various legislative provisions.
The legislative framework for the insolvency laws in India.
So corporate insolvency was not basically covered in the Companies Act of 1956.
The Companies Act of 1956 only had a provision for winding up of a company.
If a company is unable to pay its debts.
The insolvency procedure was mentioned in just section 529 that in the event of winding up what will be the priority of payments.
In the priority of payments there were a few conflicting decisions of the Supreme Court.
There was a few conflicting decisions of the High Courts and before the matter was put to rest by the Supreme Court the various tribunals exercise their jurisdiction and which led to conflicting results.
Now again coming up to the analysis of the judgment of the Supreme Court.
The SARFAESI, the proceedings under the IDDBFI Act had been previously up held by the Judiciary to prevail over other laws as it was a law enacted later in time.
While section 529 was amended by the insertion of section 529 A in 1985 and workmen's dues preference over dues.
However the RDDBFI Act was passed 1993 and therefore acted as a priority legislation about the companies act.
The SARFAESI Act took care of the interest of the workmen through its own provisions by means of an association of the official liquidator with the proceedings before the DRT under the RDDBFI Act.
Similar interpretation must be taken in context of the SARFAESI Act as well.
Another reason for doing so is that section 13 requires notice to the borrower at various stages which in the case of a company under winding up being a borrower would mean requirement of notice to the official liquidator.
Now when the honorable Supreme Court delivered this recent judgment in 2016.
It acted as a major relief by reconciling the SARFAESI Act in the companies acts.
And ultimate opinion was that, thus there is no need to borrow anything from the companies act till the stage the secured assets are sold by the secured creditors in accordance with the provisions of the SARFAESI Act and the rules.
Thus the necessary provision of the companies act has been incorporated in the SARFAESI Act to protect the interest of the workman and also achieve harmony between the two acts.
In case of the insolvency process, the insolvency process has been covered under the insolvency and bankruptcy code which has provided in detailed the corporate insolvency resolution process.
The corporate insolvency resolution process has been provided for in the separate module which has been dealt with under the insolvency and bankruptcy code module.
So for further details on the corporate insolvency resolution process the module on the insolvency and bankruptcy code of 2016 may be referred to.
with this we come to an end to the module of the corporate insolvency.
And for further details and for the information you may also go through the text and material that are self assessment questions which are appended at the end of the module.
And for the further information you are most welcome to consult the respective teachers through the UGC website.
Thank you.
Investigation of Companies, its Need and Procedure.
Good morning, I am Dr. Ritu Gupta faculty National Law University, Delhi.
This module focuses on the importance of investigation relating to the affairs of the companies and the applicable procedure.
The new companies are that is Companies Act, 2013 provides for inspection, inquiry and investigation of companies which is provided in chapter 14 from sections 206 to 229 and these sections to 206 to 209 empower the registrar to call for information Inspect the books and conduct enquires.
Such powers maybe exercise if any scrutinies of any document file by a company or any other information he feels that any other explanation or information is required.
Section 210 that is Section 210 provides that the central government any conduct investigation into the affairs of the company and section 211 to 216 provide for the establishment of SFIO that is serious fraud investigation officer and investigation by Inspector when appointed.
The procedure of such investigations have been stated under section 217 and the further section in this particular chapter they provide for related steps for investigation and penalty for furnishing false, statement, mutilation and destruction of documents by the erring companies, companies they are committed any type of fraud.
The objectives: The objectives of this module are to provide preliminary knowledge about the investigation of the companies to the students.
Further the objectives are to appraise the students of the need and importance of Investigation of the companies.
And to make students understand the procedure of Investigation as prescribed under the Companies Act.
In the last few decades there have been a radical shift in the perception towards the business generally and incorporated Enterprises specifically.
If we talk about a case in National Textile Workers Union the Supreme Court of India observed that the company is now no longer a mere profit making enterprise.
But it has assumed the role of a social institution to discharge its social responsibilities for accomplishing the socio-economic objectives of a welfare state as enshrined in part 4 after constitution of India that provides for the Directive Principles of State Policy.
Further to keep an effective control and check over the functioning of the companies the Companies Act, 2013 provides for administrative machinery as well as the procedure for inspection, inquiry and investigation of the companies.
The act imposes a duty upon the directors and officers of any company to produce books and papers and provides information demanded by the registrar.
Disobedience on the part of the directors makes them liable for imprisonment as well as fine.
The registrar or the Inspector may order for search and seizure of books and papers if they have some grounds to believe.
So, those grounds should be reasonable.
The central government is authorized to issue orders for such investigations.
The activate for establishment of SFIR as I told the overview to investigate these type of frauds.
Now, let us talk about what is need about investigation of companies.
Since, the shareholders themselves are unable to supervise and ensure efficient functioning of the companies, the organized supervisors by government agencies assumes significant role.
Its only efficient and smooth functioning of the corporate that can ensure an adequate return on capital invested by the shareholders and this need is was explained by the Supreme Court in Barium Chemicals Limited case.
In Barium Chemicals Limited the Supreme Court has observed the elementary philosophy of the Companies Act is to trust the shareholders for ensuring efficient performance.
But for reasons more than one the shareholder they have already receded to the background.
Firstly, he is an investor who, for the most part does not wish to be bothered except for dividends.
Secondary, due to great diffusion of stock shareholders become indifferent to voting and controlling.
And thirdly, the shareholders are ill equipped to challenge the wisdom and experts of officers.
Fourthly, for shareholders have the means or ability to act against the management.
If we here we can take a quote from fuend (1:29) he says the reality of control can only be found in the action of public opinion and in the organized supervision exercise by government agency.
Hence, this is the importance of Investigation that is why we are doing this module and that is why the companies unclear (1:48) have provided for these positions.
Thus, the provisions for investigation they help prevent corporate abuses, as well as wrongs and ensure efficient functioning of the corporate managements.
If we compare inspection and investigation.
First, I will talk about inspection: The registrar is empowered to carry out inspection of the books of accounts and other documents of the company.
Where on a scrutiny of any document filed by a company or on any information received by him.
The register is of the opinion that any further information or explanation or any further documents relating to the company is necessary, he may by a written order required the company to furnish and writing such information.
This has been provided subsection 1 of section 206.
For carrying out on inspection or inquiry, the registrar or inspector shall have powers of a civil court in relation to the matters as has been prescribed under subsection 3 for section 207.
The registrar or inspector shall submit a report to the Central Government and recommend, if necessary, further investigations is required into the affairs of the company.
Further the registrar or inspector may enter and search the place or place or places and seize such books and papers if he has reasonable ground to believe the such papers as mentioned are likely to be destroyed, mutilated, altered, falsified or somehow they have secretary depositavely somewhere.
No company or member can ask for a copy of Inspection Report.
The expenses of Inspection are war either by the government and these are not recoverable by the company section 225 provides by.
And if we compared inspection and investigation; so let us talk about the procedure of Investigation.
First: on receiving the report of the registrar or Inspector under section 208 or on intimation of a special resolution passed by a company or in Public Interest, the Central Government may order an investigation, where necessary, into the affairs of a company.
The central government may appoint one or more persons as inspectors to investigate into the affairs of the company.
And no firm, body corporate or association shall be appointed as inspector.
Further the Central Government shall establish an office we should be termed as I told you in the introduction SFIO that is Serious Fraud Investigation Office to investigate frauds relating to companies.
It is a multi-disciplinary organization consisting of experts from various fields.
If we name banking, Law, Corporate Affairs; they may be expert in taxation or information technologies and further the details are provided.
The director of SFIR may designate such number of Inspector as he may consider necessary to investigate into the affairs of the company.
Where any case has been assigned to SFIO, no further investigation order of agency of either Central or State Government can investigate the same case.
The officer designated shall have the powers of an inspector as has been provided under section 217.
SFIO shall conduct the investigation in the matter and follow the procedure as per the provisions.
And he is going to submit his report to the central government within the specified time period.
The Central Government may demand an interim report of the investigation.
The Director, Additional Director or Assistant Director of SFIO may a rest any person who he believes is guilty of an offence punishable under the section.
Such person arrested shall within 24 hours be taken to a Judicial Magistrate or a Metropolitan Magistrate who have got the jurisdiction.
A copy of investigation report may be obtained by any person concerned by making an application in this regard to the court Section 212 subsection 3 can be referred for this.
The expenses, in the first instant, shall be defrayed by the Central Government but may be reimbursed partially or fully by the person as prescribed under section 225.
Let us talk about the rights of bail of persons charged and arrested guilty persons.
Sections 212 subsection 6 to 10 provide for at the deal with the procedure aspect.
The offences specified under various provisions of the act that attract punishment for fraud under section 447 are to be cognizable offences.
The persons accused of any such offence shall not be released or on his own bond unless the public prosecutor have been given an opportunity to oppose the application for such release.
The court is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for believing that he is not guilty of such offence and that he is not likely to commit any offence.
However, the following may be release on bail if the special court so directs, if the situation is that the person is below 16 years of age.
It’s a women or somebody who is sick or somebody who is frail (8:13) or info.
The special court is not to take cognizance of any offence except upon a complaint in writing made by the director, or by the SFIR investigating officer or any other officer of the Central Government authorized by a general or special order in writing.
These limitations of section 212 subsection 6 are in addition to the limitation as have been provided under the Criminal Procedure Code, 1973.
Let us now discuss the powers of the Central Government: The central government may appoint persons having expertise in the field of investigations, cyber forensics, I have they may be persons from financial accounting, management accounting, cost accounting and any other field as may be necessary for efficient discharge of SFIO functions under the act.
Rule 3 of the Companies Act inspection, investigation and enquiry rules 2014 provides for it.
The Central Government where it deems appropriate, may assign the investigation into the affairs of any erring company as per the provisions of Section 212 to the SFIO.
Further if the central government so directs, the SFIO shall submit an interim report or investigation report on completion of the investigation to the central government.
On receipt of the investigation report, the Central Government may after examination of the report and after taking such legal advice as it may think fit direct SFIO to initiate prosecution against the company and its officer or employees, who or have been in employment of the company or any other person directly or indirectly connected with the affairs of the company.
Where the Central Government orders such investigation, it may required the applicant to give such security not exceeding rupees 25,000 for payment of costs and expenses of investigation as per the criteria which has been mentioned in the rule 5 of the companies inspection investigation rules as I just talks 2014 rules.
And now talk about investigation by the tribunal and section 213 of the new companies act provides for it and it says that the following other cases: the terminal may order investigation into companies affairs where an application has been made by a member not less than hundred members or members holding 110 of the total voting power in the case of a company having share capital not less than one-fifth of the person on the company's register of members.
In the case of a company if the companies without share capital and the said application should be supported by such evidence as may be necessary for the purpose of showing that the applicant has a good reason for seeking an order.
And if that application is made by any other person or otherwise the circumstances suggest that the business of the company is being conducted with intent to defraud its creditors, member or any other person or otherwise for fraudulent or unlawful purposes or in a manner oppressive to any of its members or that the company was formed for any fraudulent or unlawful purpose.
Persons concerned in the formation of the company or management of the affairs have been guilty of fraud, misfeasance and other misconduct towards the company or towards any of its members or the members of the company have not been given all the information about its affairs which they might reasonably expect including information relating to calculation of the commission payable to managing or other directors, or to the manager, of the company.
Reasonable opportunity of being heard must be provided to the concerned parties.
The Central Government shall appoint one or more persons or inspectors to investigate into the affairs of the company.
Such Inspectors shall submit their reports to the government.
The defaulting persons are liable to be punished for fraud and that have been provided under section 447.
Let us talk about investigation of ownership of the company.
Sometimes what happens in Public Interest, it becomes necessary for the central government to know that true person who are financially interested in the success or failure of a company and control its policy, or materially influence the policy? So, in view of these mentioned reason section 216 of the act provides that the Central Government shall appoint one or more inspectors to investigate and submit report on matters pertaining to the company and its membership.
Moreover, the Central Government is bound to appoint Inspectors if the tribunal, in the course of any proceeding before it, directs that the affairs of the company ought to be investigated as regards its membership and other purpose.
The Central Government may define the scope of the investigation, whether in respect to the matters or the period which it should extend and particularly may limit the investigation to matters connected with particular shares or debentures.
The powers of Inspector shall extends to the investigation of any circumstances suggesting the existence of any arrangement or understanding, which though not legally binding, may be observed in present or past or is likely to be observed in future or in practice and which is relevant for the purposes of investigation.
Now, we talk about the procedure and power of Inspectors.
Section 217 of the acts provides for it.
Which state that it is the duty of all officers, employees and agents, past and present, including those of any other corporate whose affair are under investigation section 219 states to preserve and produce to the Inspector all books and papers relating to the company and otherwise are reasonably able to give.
For investigation the Inspector has the power of civil court and a reasonable assistance shall be provided to him by the officer of the Central or State Government or police or any other statutory authority.
Notes of the examinations are to be taken in writing, read over to the person, signed by him and they become evidence against him.
Failure to furnish requisite information, or procurer books and papers, to appear before the inspector in person whenever required or to sign notes makes a defaulter punishable.
That punishable can be imprisonment for a term extending to 6 months and fine of not less than rupees 25,000 and extend up to rupees 1,00,000 and rupees 2,000 for everyday during which the default continues.
The central government may enter into agreement with the government of a foreign state for reciprocal arrangements to assist any inspection, inquiry or investigation.
Further, section 218 which protects employees from any action been taken against them during the course of investigation without approval of the tribunal.
Section 219 enables the inspectors to conduct investigation into the affairs of the related companies.
Further, section 220 empowers the inspector to conduct searches and seizures as if he had the right to do so under the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code, 1973.
The tribunal is empowered to order for freezing of the assets of the company during inquiry and investigation under the prescribed circumstances.
Further impose restriction upon securities if appears to be necessary which are needed for finding the real facts.
Section 223, provides that the inspector may submit his interim reports and final report on the conclusion of the investigation in the Central Government.
A copy of the report can be obtained by making an application to the Central Government and the report has to be authenticated by the seal of the company whose affairs have been investigated, or by a certificate of the public officer having custody of the reports as per section 76.
If we can recall evidence act, 1872 and this report is admissible in any legal proceeding as evidence to its contents.
This section shall not apply to the report of SFIO and section 212.
Now, we talk about the action which is to be taken in pursuance of the report section 224 of the act provides and its states if from the report, it appears that any person have been guilty of an offence for which he is criminally liable, the Central Government may prosecute him for the offence.
If the report shows that it would be expedient to wind up the company, the Central Government may file a petition for winding up on the following grounds can be stated that is just and equitable grounds or if an application for prevention of oppression and mismanagement under section 241 or both this factors are present.
If it appears to the Central Government from the report that the proceedings ought to be brought in public interest by the company or anybody corporate whose affairs have been investigated for recovery of damages in respect of fraud, misfeasance or other misconduct in the promotion, formation or management of the company or for recovery of any property of such company, then the central government may itself bring proceedings for winding up in the name of company, for which the company has to indemnify the government of its costs.
Now, we discuss the disgorgement of benefits obtained by the director, section 224 subsection 5 states where the report states that a fraud has taken place in a company and due to such fraud any director, key managerial personnel, other officer of the company or any other person or entity, has taken undue advantage or benefit in any form what so ever, the Central Government may file an application to the tribunal for appropriate order for disgorgement of such benefit.
And also for holding the person concerned liable personally without any limitation or liability.
Section 225 of the act provides for expenses of the investigation which are to be borne by the Central Government at the initial stage but the government can seek reimbursement from any person who has been convicted or prosecuted or called upon to pay damages or restore the property of the company.
The company in whose name the proceedings have been brought or persons dealt within the report or applicants for investigation where the inspector was appointed under section 213.
Further section 226 provide for voluntary winding up of the company which should not stop somehow investigation.
An investigation can be initiated and it is not to be stopped only because an application has been made under section 241 or the company has passed a special resolution for voluntary winding up or any other proceeding for the winding up of the company is pending before the tribunal.
The Inspector has to inform the tribunal of the pendency of the investigation.
The Tribunal may pass such order as it deems fit.
Legal Advisers and Bankers not to disclose the information certain information under section 227 that those legal advisor or bankers they should not disclose any privileged communication or information relating to the affairs to the customers of the bank.
And section 228 provides for investigation of foreign companies with effect from first April, 2014.

Now I will introduce you to the contents of the module .
The new companies Act confers powers on the central government to constitute National Company Law Tribunal and National Company Law appellate Tribunal.
These tribunals are Quasi judicial bodies that govern the companies which are functioning in India and administer the provisions of the Act .
The present act has replaced the earlier body known as company law board club .
It would exercise almost similar powers that were being assigned to by the erstwhile company Law Board.
The constitution of one body that is NCLT has streamlined the administration of justice under the Act .
It is intended to have greater expertise to adjudicate disputes more efficiently and expeditiously .
The appeal from NCLT orders would lie before NCLAT .
The second appeal maybe file with Supreme Court.
The whole justice administration system has been made time bound .
The Tribunals comprise of senior judicial and Technical members and these Tribunals are not bound by the procedure as has been laid by the Civil Procedure Code 1908 and have the power to regulate their own procedures.
These are to be further guided by the principles of natural justice pngs .
Their orders are enforceable just like the degree of any Court .
Now, let us discuss the constitution of National Company Law Tribunal which has been provided under section 408 .
National Company Law Tribunal is a successor quasi judicial body of Company Law Board.

It shall consists of a chairperson and members not exceeding 11 .
The central government shall notify such appointments.
The appellate Tribunal has to hear appeals against the orders of the Tribunal.
Further section 411 states the chairperson shall be a person who is or has been a Judge the supreme court or the chief justice of a High Court .
A judicial member has to be a person who is a sitting or retired judge of the high court or judicial member of the Tribunal for 5 years .
A technical member has to possess the same qualifications as stated in the constitution of the Tribunal.
Section 412 provides for selection of member .

The members of the Tribunal and Technical members of Appelate Tribunal have to be appointed on the recommendation of a selection committee .
The selection committee shall consist of Chief Justice of India or his nominee who will be the chairperson of the committee.
Then we have the following members.
Senior judge of the supreme court or Chief Justice of a High Court ,Secretary in the Ministry of Corporate Affairs secretary in the ministry of law and Justice and secretary in the department of financial services who is in the ministry of finance.
Further the secretary in the Ministry of Corporate Affairs shall be the convener of the selection committee.
The said Committee shall determine its procedure for recommending persons as we have just discussed .
However no such appointment of the members of the Tribunal or the appellate Tribunal shall be invalid due to any defect or vacancy in the constitution of the selection committee .
Now let us discuss the terms of office and salary structure .
Section 413 to 414 provide for it.
The president in every other member of the terminal is to hold office for a term of 5 years from the date on which enters upon his office.
He shall be eligible for reappointment for another term of 5 years.
The age of retirement would be 67 years for the president while that of the members is 65 years .
The salary allowances and other terms and conditions of service of the members of the Tribunal and the appellate Tribunal would be prescribed under the rules .
However we have to see it that is provided further that neither the salary and allowances nor the other terms and conditions of service of the member shall be varied to the prejudice of those who have been appointed.
National Company Law Appellate Tribunal, salaries allowances and other terms and conditions of service of the chairperson and other members rules 2014.
And National Company Law Tribunal salary, allowances and other terms and conditions or service of the president and other members rules 2013 may be referred for the same along with the other rules.
Whatever rules have been drafted and when whenever these rules are framed by the concerned authorities.
Section 415 provides that, if any Casual Vacancy arises in the office of the President or chairperson or in his ability to Act .
The senior most member is to act until new appointment if the chairperson, the president or any other member wishes to resign .

However as per section 416, such president chairperson or the member shall continue to hold office until there are again certain conditions.
And tell the expiry of 3 months from the date of receipt of such notice by the central government or a person duly appointed as his successor and enters upon his office or his term of the office comes to an end or out of above mentioned whichever is earliest becomes applicable in that particular situation.
Now, let us discuss how these members can be removed .
Section 417 provides for the removal of the members .
The central government may order for the removal of any of the persons appointed under earlier sections ,which we have just discussed ,after consultation with Chief Justice of India in the following He has been adjudged as an insolvent or has been convicted for an offence which in the opinion of the central government involves moral turpitude or has become physically or mentally in-capable of acting.
In such cases the President , the Chairperson or the member or has a acquired such financial or other interest as is likely to affect prejudicially his functions.
As such president ,the chairperson of the member or has so abused his position as to render his continents in office prejudicial to the public interest .
Further, the provider to the section is also there , states that accept for the extra reason mentioned under clauses A.
The removal on any other ground would require reasonable opportunity of being heard.
A removal may be effected by the central government in case of proved miss-behaviour or if the situation is of any incapacity where enquiry has been made by a judge of the Supreme Court .
Such person must have been informed of the charges against him and he should be given a reasonable opportunity of being heard in accordance with the principles of natural justice .
Although he may be suspended during the period of enquiry .
Now it's the time to discuss orders of the Tribunal.
And how the appeal can be filed ?The provisions which are necessary here are sections 422, 423.
The Tribunal within 2 years from the date of the order may rectify mistakes in its orders.
No amendment however can be made to an order against which an appeal has been referred.
The copy of every order shall be sent to the concerned parties.
Further , the Appeal may be preferred before the appellate Tribunal against any order of the Tribunal by any agreed within a period of 45 days from the date.
We have to count from the date on which the copy of the order of the Tribunal is made available to the aggrieved person .
Section 421 subsection states 1 this and if any order is passed by the Tribunal with the consent of the parties.
No appeal shall lie against any such order to the appellate Tribunal .
The appeal to appellate Tribunal shall be in such form and accompanied by such fees as may be prescribed.
In case the Appellate Tribunal is satisfied that the appellant was sufficient cause from filing the appeal within the period of limitation of 45 days, the appellate Tribunal may condone the delay in filing of appeal but not exceeding 45 days.
After the expiry of period of limitation of 45 days and entertain the appeal after expiry of said period of 45 days.
On receipt of appeal the appellate Tribunal shall provide a reasonable opportunity of hearing to the parties to the appeal.
And after hearing the parties to the appeal shall pass such orders.
There why confirming modifying or setting aside the order which has been applied against as its thinks fit and send a copy of every order made by it to the Tribunal as well as to the parties to the appeal.
Further, we can see that section 422 provides that every application has to be dealt with and disposed off as expeditiously as far as possible.
It should be disposed of the time frame.
You can note that it is within 3 months where such disposal is not done.
Reasons for not doing so should be recorded in writing .
After taking into account such reasons, the president or the chairperson may allow a further period of 90 days for disposal .
Anybody who is aggrieved by any order of the appellate Tribunal may file an appeal to the supreme court within 60 days from the receipt of the order of the appellate Tribunal to him .
It should involve a question of law .
The period may further extended by another set of 60 days and it should specify sufficient cause.
Now is the time to discuss procedure which is being followed by the Tribunal and Appellate Tribunal.
Section 424 of the Companies Act 2013 provides for it.
The Tribunals shall not be bound by the procedure as has been laid down by the Civil Procedure Code 1908 but guided by the principles of natural justice .
These have a powers to regulate their own procedure for the purpose of discharging their functions .
Under the act, Tribunal shall have the same powers as are vested in a Civil Court while trying a suit with respect to the following.
I am just , I am narrating the instances summoning and enforcing the attendance of any person and examining him on it requiring the discovery and selection of documents.
Receiving evidence on affidavit subject to the provisions of sections 123 and 124 of the Evidence Act 1872 requisitioning any public record or document or a copy of such record or document from any office .
Issuing commissions for the examination of witnesses or documents dismissing representation for default or deciding it ex-parte, setting aside any order of dismissal of any representation for default or any order passed by it .
Any other matter as may be prescribed.
The orders of the Tribunals are enforceable in the same manner as a decree of the court.
In the case of a company, the order will be sent for enforcement to the court in whose local limits the office of the company is situated .
If the order is against an individual, the order is to be sent to the court in whose local limits the individual resides or carries on business or professionally works for gain.
These tribunals shall have the power to punish those who commit contempt of tribunals .
Further, the tribunals have limited power of delegation of their powers.
The president members and officers are deemed to be Public servants by virtue of the provisions which have been provided under section 427 .
And they are not to be punished for any action which has been taken in good faith section 428 provides for it.
Further, section 429 provides for the powers to seek assistance of chief Metropolitan magistrates while section 430 provide that due to the extent of powers vested in the Tribunal ,no Civil Court would have any jurisdiction.
This is again a very any relevant provision.
Any vacancy in the Tribunal shall not invalidate any acts of proceedings by virtue of section 431 .
Section432 confers the right to legal representation upon the parties regarding limitation .
Section 433 describes that the provision of the limitation act 1963 are as far as possible would apply to the proceedings or the appeals before the tribunals.
The proceedings before the said tribunals are deemed to be judicial proceedings within the meaning of Section 193 and section 228 of the Indian penal code and also for the purpose of section 198 of IPC .
These are to be demmed to be civil courts for the purpose of section 195 as well as chapter XXVI of The Criminal Procedure Code 1908 .
The tribunals have the power to punish those who commit content of the Tribunals.
This has been stated under section 425 .
Section 425 provides that the Tribunal and appellate Tribunal shall have the same jurisdiction power and authority in respect of contempt of themselves as the High Court has and may exercise for this purpose.
Thus the powers under the provisions of The Contempt of courts Act 1971 which shall have the effect subject to modifications which can be that the reference to a high court shall be construed as including a reference to the tribunals and the Appellate tribunals.
The reference to advocate general under Section 15 of the said Act shall be construed as a reference to such law offices as the central government may specify.
Now, let us talk about the delegation of powers .
The power which are vested with the tribunals .
The Tribunal or appellate Tribunal may by General or special order direct subject to certain conditions .
If that may be as specified in the order ,any of its officers or employees or any other person who has been authorised by it to enquire into the matters connected with any proceeding or as the case may be appeal before it and to report it in such manner as may be specified in the order.
Further section 427 and section 428 state that the president members and officers are deemed to be public servants within the meaning of Section 21 of Indian penal code as stated as we have seen under section 427.
And they should not be punished for any action taken in good faith.
This section stated in section 428 .
Section 429 provides for the power to seek assistance of chief Metropolitan magistrates.
It states that the tribunal may in any proceeding relating to a sick company or winding up of any other company in order to take into custody or under it’s control.
All property Bank of accounts or other documents request in writing today the CMM that is Chief metropolitan magistrate ,chief judicial magistrate or the district controller within whose jurisdiction any such property, books of accounts or other documents of such sick company are situated are found to take possession thereof.
Such officers may take possession of such property ,books of accounts or other documents and cost to be entrusted to the Tribunal or other person authorised by it.
Here we can see that the purpose of securing compliance with the provisions of all of the provisions as we have just discussed the CMM, CGM of the DC may take such steps and use such force as may in his opinion is necessary .
No Act of the CMM that is Chief metropolitan magistrate ,Chief Judicial Magistrate or the district controller done in pursuance of this section shall be called in question in any Court or before any authority on any ground whatsoever .
Section 430 provides that to the extent of powers vested in the tribunal, no Civil Court would have any jurisdiction .
Moreover any vacancy in the Tribunal shall not invalidate any acts or proceedings by virtue of section 431 .
Section 432 confers the right to legal representation upon the parties.
If we talk about limitation section 433 prescribs that the provisions of the limitation act 1963 are as far as possible would apply to the proceedings or if we talk about the appeals before the Tribunals.
Transfer of proceedings has been mentioned under section 434.
Now let us see what are the outcomes of the today's module.
In this module ,we have discussed many things about tribunals as have been provided under the Companies Act 2013 .
Specially we have learnt about these quasi-judicial authorities .
Then we had tried to understand how this tribunal is constituted, how the members are selected and how the members can be removed from their respective positions,.
We have also looked into the details of the their salary and the term of the service .
We have also tried to find the prescribed procedure as per the Companies Act 2013 and what can be the time for filing of appeal before appellate Tribunal and the supreme court.
We have also known at the end of this module how the orders are being passed by these tribunals and how this act is effective in expeditious disposal of the applications.
Thank you.
Hello I am Santhi, today we will be doing the Corporate law MOOC course.
Under this course, today we will be looking at corporate governance in Indian companies.
What are the objectives of this particular module? The first objective is to understand the concept and importance of corporate governance.
The second important objective is to understand what are the issues in corporate governance.
The third objective is to understand what are the provisions relating to corporate governance under the Companies Act 2013.
The other and the final objective is to understand what are the requirements of Clause 49 of the SEBI listing agreement.
First let us look at how did the corporate governance emerge.
During the begining of the twentieth century, we had a lot of illegal and unethical corporate business practices of the high profile business companies.
You we can take all of you might be knowing about the and Enron issue that had happened during the mid 20th century.
Now this resulted in the requirement of good governance practices.
So actually the and Enron and the various scams it shocked the business world.
What is happening? You need to have good business practices, you are playing with the money of the shareholders and for this you need to have good business practices.
And so this resulted in the requirement for having a very good governance principles.
And this laid to the thought process that fair and transparent mechanism has to be evolved to run and administer the corporation.
So, this fair and transparent mechanism that the businesses they tried to evolve.
They are based on four principles and this basis of which the fair and transparent mechanism emerged.
The first pillar was accountability, that is the company should be accountable for its action.
The company should adopt fairness in its dealings, the company should be transparent in its dealings.
The company should be having independent authority, the directors that is the CFO, there is executive, there should be an independence in the functioning of the company.
So, the four pillars of corporate governance are accountability, fairness, transparency and independence.
Now let us look at what is the definition of corporate governance.
So, corporate governance basically as you would understand is a fair and transparent mechanism to run the business.
According to the OECD the definition given by the Organization of Economic Council and Development corporate governance lays down the procedures and processes according to which the company is controlled.
Corporate governance is also set of relationships between a company's management, its boards, its shareholders and other stakeholders.
Now what are the issues under corporate governance? What all would come under corporate governance? How do you distinguish between the board and the management? What is the composition of the board of directors and related issues? What is the role separation, I mentioned earlier independence CEO and the Chairman of the company.
What are the remunerations of the directors? what should be the disclosures that should be done by the company? What should be the auditing process? how would you protect the shareholder rights and their expectations? What would be the role of the institutional shareholders? What would be the role of the investors? Now these are some of the issues under the corporate governance.
These are the issues that basically is taken care of in the corporate governance.
Now let us look at what is the importance of corporate governance, if a fair and transparent mechanism is followed how does it help the company.
It helps in the prosperity and progress of the company, it showcases the integrity of the company, it creates wealth through legal and ethical standards.
The benefits of corporate governance are that it will help the company in maintaining good relations with the various stakeholders, its various stakeholders.
It would provide protection to the interest of the shareholders.
It would help in , giving confidence to the investors.
It would help in increasing the value of the corporation.
It would ensure that the laws of the land are complied with.
You are more into compliance with the legal and the ethical standards.
Now let us very briefly look at how did the corporate governance emerged in India.
As you know, during the periods of 1991 we had lot of liberalization policies coming in.
Now it was the confederation of Indian industry in December 1995.
It set up a task force to draw a voluntary code of corporate governance.
This voluntary code of corporate governance was released in 1998 and this is called as the desirable corporate governance a code.
The name of the code was desirable corporate governance a code.
We had a Companies Act 1956 now, what was corporate governance or the what were the mechanism of corporate governance that was mentioned in the Companies Act 1956.
Let's have a look, the Companies Act 1956 is provided a formal structure of governance.
However it did not address the corporate governance problems adequately such as it need the prescribed any formal qualification, not duties for the directors of the company.
There were no difference in the management between the arrangement between the duties of a executive director and a non executive director.
And the focus on the financial reporting, it was rather on the rules, rather than on being transparent enough.
Then there was no chance of the auditors or the relation I mean the interaction between the auditors and the shareholder.
So, this resulted in and it could result in malpractices 'corporate malpractices'.
And then the company they did not have any provisions redressal of grievances.
So, this Companies Act 1956 had many lacunars as far as the functioning of the corporate governance was concerned.
Now the confederation of Indian Industries took an initiative under Mr. Rahul Bajaj and a task force was constituted and certain recommendations were prescribed by the Bajaj committee for the CII.
Now some of those recommendations were the board of directors were required to meet at least six times a year.
A person could not be a director of more than 10 companies.
A listed company of rupees hundred crores and above should had a professionally and competent recognize, independent non-executive director having clearly defined policies.
And the annual operating plans and budgets they had to be incorporated in the annual report.
The other recommendation was the stock exchange had to insist on a compliance certificate would should be signed by the CEO and CFO that all the accounting policies and procedures were followed.
After this, after the CII confederation Bajaj Committee report.
We had the next commitee that was constituted was by SEBI and SEBI constituted a committee under the chairmanship of Mr.Kumaramangalam Birla.
Now the Birla committee made certain recommendations.
the recommendations were applicable to all listed companies with paid up share capital of rupees three crores and above.
And the board of directors were to consist of an optimum combination of executive and non executive directors of which the number of independent directors had to be at least one third in case of a company, had to be a non executive chairman and at least one half in the company has to be have an executive chairman.
Further there has to be an independent and qualified audit committee to setup to enhance the credibility of the financial disclosures and promote transparency.
The other recommendation was the remuneration of non executive directors were to be decided by the board of directors.
The next recommendation was the board meeting was to be held at least four times a year with a with a maximum gap of not more than 2 months.
Then the management discussion and analysis were to be covered the report that need to be presented should covered the industry structure, the opportunities, the threats, the segment wise system etc.
Then a separate section on corporate governance covering the companies philosophy on code of governance, board of directors, audit committee, remuneration committee, shareholders committee etc was to be included in the annual report.
So, these had to be included in the annual report.
Now keeping this in mind, keeping these recommendations SEBI introduced clause 49 in its listing agreement on January twenty fifth in the year 2000 on January twenty fifth.
So, now as per this particular clause the information that was required to be placed before the board of directors on a periodic basis was budgets and annual operating plants, update on capital budgets, results for the company and its operating divisions or business segments of every quarter minutes of the audit committee meetings, the labour relations fatal or serious accident.
All these had to be incorporated in the report and that report had to be placed before the board of directors on a periodic basis as per clause 49 of SEBI’s listing agreement.
Subsequently, in 2002 the Ministry of Corporate Affairs appointed a committee under the chairmanship of Mr. Naresh Chandra.
The Naresh Chandra committee gave certain recommendations.
What were those recommendations? The first recommendation was that the board of directors needed to have at least half of its members as independent directors for the formal letters of appointment mentioning the fiduciary duties, terms of appointment, companies code of business ethics should be issued to the directors.
The next recommendation was the remuneration committee had to be constituted with majority being the independent directors.
Then the constitution of an audit committee compromising mainly of non executive directors with independent directors mainly constituting the majority.
The office of the chairman and chief executive officer, they were required to be separated.
And then the other recommendation was that the audit committee had to pre approve all related party transactions and stringent guidelines for the relationship between auditors and the clients were required to be maintained.
These were the recommendations under the Naresh Chandra Committee report.
Now in the year 2003 a committee was constituted under the chairmanship of Narayana Murthy, this initiative was taken by SEBI.
Now the Narayana Murthy committee give certain mandatory recommendations and certain non-mandatory recommendation.
Now, what were the mandatory recommendations? The audit committees of publically listed committees were required to review financial information records of related party transactions, risk management and legal compliances.
Further at least one member of the audit committee was required to have expertise in financial management.
So, an expert had to be nominated in the audit committee.
The next recommendation was the statements relating to related party transaction was required to be placed before the independent audit committee.
The next recommendation was the board of directors were required to lay down a code of conduct for all board members and the top management of the company.
The next recommendation was that the nominee directors should be appointed by the shareholders.
These were mandatory recommendations.
Now, what are the non mandatory recommendations? The first one, the board members were required to be trained in the business model of the company.
The second recommendation was that the board was to set up a remuneration committee to decideremuneration packages for the executive directors.
The next recommendation was that a performance evaluation of non executive directors had to be carried out by the board of directors.
So, the Narayana Murthy Committee gives certain mandatory recommendations and non mandatoryrecommendations.
Then in the year 2005 the Ministry of Corporate Affairs under the chairmanship of Dr. JJ Irani was required to submit a report on company Law.
Now in that particular report the recommendations were that in any particular listed company one third of the total number of directors or the board should compromise of independent directors.
The next recommendation was that, that the total number of directorship that could be held by a director was up to the maximum limit was 15 and then the corporate should allow be allowed to maintain pyramidal structures.
That is a company which is a subsidiary or holding company should be a holding company.
Then in the year 2009 SEBI came out with the corporate governance voluntary guidelines.
Now what are those voluntary guidelines?Some of the we can look at some of the provisions of the voluntary guidelines.
Under those voluntary guidelines a formal letter had to be issued to the independent and non executive directors.
There had to be a demarcation between the office of the chairman and the non executive officer.
A nomination committee had to be constituted of majority of the independent directors for searching and recommending and for appointing appropriate Independent and executive directors and the number of directorship should be limited to 7 members.
This was the corporate governance voluntary guidelines.
Now the companies if they wanted to they could ensure and follow these guidelines.
There were some companies which made these I mean they under took these voluntary guidelines.
However under the Companies Act 2013, the corporate governance got a new focus.
Now the provisions that were incorporated under the Companies Act 2013.
What were the those provisions? Let us look at those provisions that are incorporated under corporate governance.
So the Companies Act 2013, emphasized a lot on improving the corporate governance of the companies that is in improving the fair and transparent mechanism of managing the companies.
Now as relating to the independent directors.
The independent directors should be persons of integrity that is the Companies Act two 2013 laid down that the independent directors had to be persons of integrity and should possessrelevant experience of 5 years upto a period should possess relevant experience and had to be appointed for a period of 5 years.
And the code of conduct of the independent directors were also being prescribed in separate schedule to the act.
Now, the listed companies and other public companies with paid up share capital of rupees 1000 crore or more or turnover of rupees 300 crore or more as on the last date of the last latest audited financial statement was required to appoint women director.
So, a new concept emerged, the appointment of women directors.
The other points that was incorporated in the corporate governance under the Companies Act2013 was the key managerial person should also include a whole time director.
Provisions were also introduced for appointing a residential director who had stayed in India for a total period of not less than 182 days that is a person who stayed 182 days he could be appointed as a residential director.
And then a person could not hold directorships of more than 15 companies.
Further a director was disqualified if he was convicted with any offence which related to third party transactions.
Now the report of the board that is the board of directors this should also contain an additional disclosure.
So, the provisions of an additional disclosures were also incorporated.
Now what are those additional disclosures? CSR policy, implementation of risk management policy, the director's appointment and the remuneration policy and also policies relating to and also provisions relating to the related party transactions.
So, all those had to be additionally disclosed by the companies.
The next provision that was incorporated was that the company cannot enter into transactions or agreement with related parties unless approved by the shareholders.
And this is one of the very important changes that have been brought about by the Companies Act 2013 that is you cannot enter into transactions with related parties unless you get the approval of the shareholders.
The other most important provision that was incorporated under Companies Act 2013 was that regarding to insider trading.
The insider trading is prohibited and in case there are violations then punishment shall be imposed if the persons are involved in insider trading.
Another very very important provision that has been incorporated under Companies Act 2013 is provision for class actions suits.
Now, these class action suits they empowered the minority shareholders to seek action against mismanagement.
Now all these changes were incorporated in the Companies Act 2013.
The class action suits, the related party transactions, the insider trading, new provisions were introduced in Companies Act 2013.
Keeping in this the SEBI also modified its listing agreement.
Now as per the SEBI’s new listing agreement that is clause 49, the board of directors should compromise of both executive and non executive directors but non executive directors should not be less than 50% of the full strength of the board.
Then the compensation of fees paid to the non executive directors including independent directors shall be fixed by the board of directors with the previous approval of the shareholders in the general meeting.
The other requirement was the related party transactions that is the disclosure of all the transactions with related parties had to be undertaken by the companies.
Then the annual report should also contain a management discussion and analysis regarding the company's competitive position.
The shareholders had also to be given information regarding the appointment, reappointment or remuneration of the directors.
And also the companies had to provide a certificate stating that financialstatements had tobe reviewed by the chief executive officer and chief financial officer.
And every quarter a compliance report had to be filed and these compliance certificate and these compliance report had to be certified either by a auditor or the practicing company secretary.
And further the annual operating plans and budgets, they are also required to be filed in the companies.
So, now we have looked at the provisions of the corporate governance under Companies Act 2013.
Now, let us look at certain corporate governance practices in the Indian companies.
Now, for example in the case of ITC, the four principles of corporate governance which they believe in are trusteeship, empowerment, accountability and control and ethical corporate sustainability.
Then in the case of Maruti Suzuki, it considers itself to be a conscious and vigilant organizations.
The company has initiated good governance practices and it forms an integral part of the companies culture.
It has also constituted a control self assessment mechanism which evaluates the effectiveness of its internal control over the financial use.
Now Infosys, Infosys is another company which seeks to have good corporate governance practices.
The company has won many awards for undertaking the best corporate governance practices in India.
the company discloses to seek to attend the company disclosure they seek to attend the best practices of international governance standards.
Then you have HCL Technologies, the companies undertakes independent review of the corporate governance practices.
Now there are companies with good corporate governance practices but there are also corporate governance failures.
For example in the case of Sahara in the case of Sahara the Supreme Court has directed the SEBI to oversee the refund of investments that has been made by the investors through OFCDs in the two group companies, Sahara Indian Real Estate Corporation and Sahara Housing Investment corporations.
The Supreme Court has held at the SEBI could have special powers to investigate, adjudicate and protect the interest of the shareholders.
Now here the question of Sahara corporate governance was an issue and then you have the case of the real estate firm DLF which was barred by SEBI for 3 years on the grounds of non disclosure of financial details.
You have another case of financial technologies which came into light for executing a number of related party transactions without the approval or it was not in the best interest of the shareholders.
Then you had the leading pharmaceutical company Ranbaxy which is being accused of committing systemic fraud and then you had the case of Reebok in 2012 which to fraud of 8700 crore.
Now, the next concept which is very important is the concept of whistleblowing, which allows the reporting of malpractices or misconduct or corruption within the company which affect the third parties.
Now there are global legislations the Sarbanes Oxley Act or you have the the Public Interest Disclosure Act at the international level, in India also we have the Clause 49 which has a non binding requirement of establishing a whistleblowers policy for all listed company.
So, in case if there are genuine concerns you could approach the you could take the help of the mechanism and report the corrupt practices.
Then section 177 clause 9 of the Companies Act allows the listed companies makes the listed requires a listed companies to have a vigil mechanism in case of if there are they have to have a vigil mechanism which is to be operated by the audit committee or the board.
So for that a director shall be nominated who will undertake the role of the audit committee and the whistleblower could report any unethical behaviour or policies or frauds that are committing being committed in the company.
Now here section 177 clause 10 it provides for the safeguarding the victimization of the persons but the anonymity of the person that is still not been given by that particular provision that's a drawback of that particular provision.
Now this audit committee can take care it can take action in case of any frivolous complaints.
And then it is the independent director has been given a duty ascertain whether the vigil mechanism in functioning properly or not.
Now the vigil mechanism the details about the vigil mechanism should be displayed on the website.
And now if we see the corporate governance policies these corporate governance policies have actually provisions that have been incorporated in the Companies Act 2013 has laid to an improvement in the India's position in the world rankings.
India is now Ranked at 130 in the World bank’s doing business in the year 2016.
Now, the improvement in these rankings can be linked to better governance practices that are being followed by the Indian companies.
Now the further focus on the corporate governance standards it should not be merely as compliances but it should be a part of the companies culture.
Now, if it becomes a part of companies culture the effectiveness of the corporate governance would increase and this would lead it to better competition better Indian companies could which stand global competition and can sustain in the long run.
I am Shanti, assistant professor with school of business studies Sharda University.
Today, I’ll be taking up the Corporate law mook course and the topic under that Corporate law mooc course is Corporate Social Responsibility.
The objectives of the module are: the student should be able to understand the concept and importance of CSR.
The students should be able to understand the advantages and disadvantages of CSR, the CSR in company is and what are the requirements as per the Indian Companies Act, 2013? Now, let us first understand what is CSR? Now, we all know that Business and Society, they are inextricable part of this particular world.
You cannot separate business from the current day economic situations.
So, for these businesses to function in a particular manner without harming the resources or sustaining the resources in the long run, we need to understand that the business also become responsible in certain ways towards the society.
So, the corporate social responsibility concept: it refers to the way businesses are managed to bring about an overall positive impact on the cultures, communities, societies and environment.
Now, businesses influences all aspects of the society: so, the actions of these businesses, as I said earlier makes a tremendous impact on the society as a whole and as I said companies are a part of the society, so their very existence depends on the society itself and in fact the companies are a making use of the society to make profits for their business.
So, whenever there is business, the leaders of that those particular businesses, they keep the economic functions and the economic contributions in the minds that is their foremost thoughts in their minds.
Now, once the businesses has started functioning the society also started expecting that the company had to be not only transparent about its profits but also wanted the companies to account for the methods in they were earning the profits.
So, the society’s expectations where the company should tell us, how are they earning these profits that was what the society's expectations where and to meet these expectations of the society something needed to be done.
So, a new thought process emerged.
A new wave of thought emerged among the business leaders that if our society is expecting something we need to reciprocate to that particular thought.
Now in the cases of businesses we know making profits is the biggest motive and we call that as ‘capitalism’.
So, we say that the outcome of capitalism is only for profit but this process as I said earlier the business leaders wanted to have a re-think.
So, recently a new concept has emerged called as Corporational Capitalism or co-capitalism.
In this even though the focus is on the profit motive yet it incorporates the essence of cooperation, accountability and values in the social context.
So, this is reflected in the new generation corporate leaders.
So, the new generation corporate leaders now had a emerged with the new thought process that we should not only focus on the profit motive but we would also focus on the corporation, accountability and values in the social context.
So here, the profit optimisation garners more importance than profit maximization and because now there was more profit optimisation the accountability shifted from the from the shareholder to the stakeholders who all were involved in the running of the business.
So, there was also a growing realisation that the businesses in long-term will depend upon the optimal use of the ecosystem.
So, if we use our resources and we don't leave it for our future generations then the business cannot sustain in the long run.
So, this responsibility to act and influence the society in a positive manner, keeping in mind the future generations and taking into account the consideration of its potential negative impacts in the decision making process and doing business became a key factor and this thought process lead to the development of this key concept.
Now, this concept as I discussed of Corporate Social Responsibility was first laid down by H.R.Bowen in his book Social Responsibility of Business.
So, the attribute H.R.Bowen as the father of Corporate Social Responsibility, further even Milton Friedman discussed the concept of corporate social responsibility.
He felt that the business was usually for making profits but, this is not only this profit that the business make should not be made causing negative impacts of the society, no negative impact of the society should be there.
Now, the other person when we practically see the Corporate Social Responsibility Steven Hunts the CEO of the Employee Engagement Platform be inspired, said that the Corporate Social Responsibility in Walt, processes, practices that gave back something to the society.
Now, this particular concept of CSR has been a very emerging kind of a concept in the recent times.
Now, this aspect of CSR or we say that the business is that are there they are not only for the economic contributions to the society.
So, in the context of CSR we need to understand that there are three aspects which are the important base of the CSR.
The first aspect is the economic aspect, the environmental aspect and the social aspect.
That is, the corporate social responsibility will not only focus on the economic aspects but will also focus on the environmental and social aspects.
This approach where we take the economic aspects, the environmental aspects and social aspects into consideration is called as the triple bottom line approach of CSR.
Now, the most common definition anybody you ask anyone the most common definition that anybody would mention about CSR is: CSR is the responsibility of the corporation towards the society and the environment.
This is the common kind of a definition.
But this definition did not come about in a day.
This definition has evolved over a period of time.
The first thing, first definition in evolved was in the fifties and this approach which was taken in the 50s is called as the Social Responsibility Approach.
Now, according to the Social Responsibility Approach businessman when under an obligation makes decisions keeping in mind the objectives and values of the society that is the shareholder approach of the 1906 50s and in the 1960s we have the stakeholder approach.
Now, what is the stake holder approach? When a socially responsible enterprise takes into account the interest of the stakeholders and the interest of the whole nation rather than only striving for the returns to its shareholders.
That means you are not only the interest of the shareholders but the interest of the whole nation.
The interest of the all the stakeholders were taken into consideration.
This was the approach in 1960.
In the 1980s we had the ‘three P’ model.
Now, what does the ‘three P’ model say? This is an evolving system which envisions and integration that is a joining together, a coming together of the Principles, the Policies and the Social Issue Management and Process of Action.
So, you have the three Ps: Principles, Policies and Process of Action which indicated the definition of Corporate Social Responsibility.
Then, in the 2000s we had the three domain approach.
Now, as per the three domain approach: ethical, legal and economic domains were considered as the three domains of CSR.
And after that period of time we had the emergence of new concept in the 21st century we had the emergence of the new concepts.
Now, the European Commission defined CSR as and integration of social Human Rights please understand Human Rights came into the context of CSR; consumer and environmental concerns with business operations.
So, it is not only the Business Operation but you have the context of Human Rights, consumers, environmental concerns coming together in close association with the various stakeholders.
Then, the next definition of CSR was given by the World Bank which is very much prevalent.
Now, that is when business commit to contribute to Sustainable Economic Development, please note the new concept that has emerged Sustainable Economic Development by working with their employees and the families, local communities and societies to upgrade lives in ways that boards good for business and development.
So, the World Bank's definition emphasizes on upgrading the lives of communities and societies.
So, the communities and societies their wellbeing is given a lot of consideration in this concept of Corporate Social Responsibility.
Hence, the Corporate Social Responsibility is not a mere charity.
It's not, but it is an act which requires the corporate to go beyond its legal obligation.
It has certain legal obligations; it has to go beyond those legal obligations to integrate, to bring in together, the ethical, the social and environmental issues in the company's business processes.
So, we have to integrate the ethical, the legal and the social issues into the business processes.
Now, when there is integration, we say that a concept of Corporate Social Responsibility has emerged.
Now, when will look at CSR there are certain basic principles that form the basis of CSR.
What are the three basic principles? The first is the concept of sustainability.
Sustainability is: the company has to be taken into consideration whatever it is doing in the present has some effect for the future generations keeping that in mind.
So, whatever it is doing now it has to remember it has to keep in mind that the future generations are getting affected.
Accountability: the company is accountable for its actions towards the society .
So whatever it is doing it has to be accountable to the society.
The third principle: transparency: that is whatever the actions of the company are it should be transparent enough to the various stakeholders.
So, the three basic principles of CSR are sustainability, accountability and transparency.
Now, what are the advantages of CSR? It addresses the social issues that are caused by the businesses.
The second is it addresses issues being proactive, that is the company knows that there are certain issues that are going to be caused because that certain how much going to be caused by the society.
So, it proactively takes steps in order to see that harmful effects do not happen.
The next advantage that CSR has is – it creates short term employment opportunities, for example: if they are building up schools, they are building up sanitation for the sanitation they are building toilets.
So, you have people who are employed in those building development.
So, people are getting employment in those particular projects.
The advantage which the Corporate Social Responsibility will provide us, it increases the sales, the productivity, the loyalty of the customers.
You will get more customers when the customers know that your products or say, you are a company that is involved in responsible business practices.
The Corporate Social Responsibility is providing something back to the society.
So, that means you are taking into future generations into account.
So, that is a sustainability issues.
You are providing sustenance for the future.
The next advantages that it helps in the increased attraction and retention of employees.
So, when you have employees with a social bent of mind those employees would prefer the kind of company these which are more engaged in the corporate social responsibility practices.
The next advantage would be that the company would focus on the product safety issues because the wellbeing of the consumer, the wellbeing of the society is in the mind of the company.
So, the company keeps in mind the product safety and it kinds of decreases the abilities that it would incur on itself.
We had looked at the advantages but the CSR has also certain disadvantages.
Now, what are those disadvantages? It restricts the free market goal of profit maximization.
Businesses want to maximize the profit, but there is in this case there are certain restrictions that happens because you have to contribute a bit to the society, it might affect your profits.
The Other disadvantages, the social issues might not be really handle properly by the companies.
Social issues like maybe there are issues which are very very harmful which the companies might not considered in a proper manner.
The next disadvantage is: it dilutes the primary aim of the business the primary aim of the business is profit maximization.
Now, the primary aim gets diluted.
Till now, what we looked on, what’s we looked at, how the corporate social responsibility definition had evolved? What is the importance of Corporate Social Responsibility? What are the three basic principles of Corporate Responsibility? Now, in India the corporate social responsibility was always a voluntary part that was required to be done by the companies.
But, the companies were not actually doing it.
They were creating falls images that they were doing corporate social responsibility.
It was completely voluntary.
But, the government thought that it was time that we introduce the corporate social responsibility as something as a part of our law and this particular thought process was reflected windy introduction of the Companies Act, 2013.
So, if we look at the history of Companies Act, 2013 ,it was on 18 December, 2013 when the companies bill was approved in the Lok Sabha.
Then on the , on 18th December, 2012 the companies bill was approved 8th August, 2013 the companies bill was approved by the Rajya Sabha and on 30th August, 2013 the gazette notification of the Companies Act, 2013 came about.
Now, in this Companies Act, 2013 a new provision regarding corporate social responsibility was introduced, section 135.
Now, the rules relating to Section 135 was notified by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs on 27th February, 2014.
What does in 135 speak about? What is one 135? Let's look at it.
Section 135 states that a company which is having a net worth of rupees 500 Crore or more net worth of rupees 500 Crore or more or has a turnover of rupees 1000 or more or has a net profit of rupees 5 crore or more during any financial year will have to constitute a corporate social responsibility committee.
So, the companies which fall under any of these three categories will have to constitute a corporate social responsibility committee.
So, let's look at what this CSR committee is composed of? The CSR committee has to be composed of at least three directors and of the three directors at least one should be an Independent Director among them.
However, in the case of private companies this requirement of independent directors being appointed to the CSR committee is exempted from.
Now, this particular composition of the CSR committee is required to be disclosed in the board’s report.
Now, what are the functions of the CSR committee? The first function of the CSR committee is to formulate a policy for the company formulator CSR policy for the company indicating what are the activities that would be undertaken by the company? What are the activities that the company would undertake for the purposes of the CSR? Now, this activity is also listed in schedule 7 to the Companies Act, 2013 which we will be looking at a little later.
And the next function of this particular committee is to recommend the expenditure that would be incurred on the CSR activities.
The CSR activities that they had decided to undertake.
The next function would be to monitor these activities by a transparent monitoring mechanism from time to time.
Now, the CSR policy which they have to frame it has to be state broadly the projects or programs that a company would undertaker.
It should also list the CSR activities and their implementation schedule that that would be undertaken in the financial in a particular financial year it should also contain a declaration to the effect that the surplus that is arising out of the CSR would not be treated as the business profits of the company.
And it should also incorporate a statement to the effect that the corpus of the CSR funds would include 2 percent of the net profits of the preceding three financial years.
So, the requirement here is that the CSR the corpus of the CSR fund should include 2 percent of the net profits of the preceding three financial years and would include any income and surplus that would arise of the CSR activities of the company.
Now, the net profit that is calculated here, is the net profit before tax as per the accounts of the companies and this particular CSR policy has to be approved by the board of directors based on the recommendations of the CSR committee.
So, a company during a financial year should ensure that 2 percent of the average net profits that it made during the immediately preceding three financial years is spend on the CSR activities.
Now, what are the modes of carrying out CSR activities? it can be through an organisation or it could be through a trust or we could be through a Section 8 company or could be a collaboration between the company or it could be through other institutions but the requirement of the other institution is that that they should have a three years track record and the expenditure should that they incur for the other institution should not be more than 5 percent.
Now, what are the CSR activities that companys could undertake? As I mentioned earlier it has been mentioned in schedule 7 and these are not activities that are considered in the normal course of the business.
Now, let's look at what are the CSR activities that are mentioned in schedule 7? The first, eradication of hunger, poverty and malnutrition, providing sanitation and Healthcare facilities, promotion of education, promotion of gender equality and help in empowering women, training in youth for employment, enhancing vocational skills and to promote rural sports, contribute to the Prime Minister's National Relief Fund or other socio-economic development funds or other rural development projects.
The latest entry into the schedule 7 are the contributions to the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.
Now, these are the activities that are mentioned in schedule 7 but there are certain activities which cannot be treated as CSR activities.
That is, in CSR activity that is undertaken by the company outside India or any political contribution that is made by the company.
A 1 of events a company conducts a marathon, that is not considered as a CSR activity or you have certain kind of sponsored activities that is for the benefits of the family members even that is not considered as a Corporate Social Responsibility activity or if there are expensive that are incurred for the fulfillment of certain legal obligations that also cannot be considered as a CSR activity.
Now, what is considered as a CSR what is expenditure? CSR expenditure includes the contribution to the CSR corpus fund.
The contributions to the projects or programmes undertaken in relations to the CSR, the payments towards salaries incurred to the employees engaged in CSR, the payment to the volunteers, the but it does not include the expenditure for any other activity other than the what is scheduled in the schedule in schedule 7 of the Act.
Now, this particular CSR activities whatever the company has to be undertaken has to be reported in the annual report which is mentioned in section 134.
Now, the annual report should contain a report of the CSR activity which indicates the manner in which the amount spent, the projects that are being carried out the detail expenditure that is incurred on the implementation of the CSR projects.
The report should also specify what is the unspent amount? So, it’s not only the amount that is spent but what is the amount that is unspent? And the report should also state why the amount has been unspent? Now, the foreign companies there are required to annexe the CSR report along with the balance sheet that they are submitting.
The penalty for the disclosure is, there are fine on companies which amounts to not less than 50,000 and not more than 25 lakhs and the officer can also be penalised for rupees 50,000 to rupees 50 lakhs.
Now, the CSR policy has to be displayed on the website.
The names of the members of the CSR committee has to be mentioned.
Now, there are some CSR initiative that are being done by the Indian companies.
We have the Tata Steel with the Tejaswini Program – ‘the hospital on wheels’,.
We have the ITC; the e-choupal from ITC IOC Foundation taking care of the cultural heritage.
The Infosys Foundation taking care of the many of the CSR activities that are being carried out.
Now, these initiatives, they are contributing to the society however the economic cause that a company along with them Sometimes provide a deterrent to carry forward of these activities .
So on one hand the objectives of the corporations and the shareholders and of the society and the stakeholders there been trying to be balance in this particular Act.
However, the challenges of implementing this particular at will determine how objective this regulation of CSR will be met in future? So, if we look at the concept of CSR, the CSR has a potential to bring in a revolution to the development of economy because we are now mandating that the businesses has to be not only be getting profits making profits but it should equally contribute back to the society.
So, whenever a businesses has two function and has to earn profits it also should think about the future.
So, when business start thinking about the future the effectiveness of the corporate social responsibility practices would increase.
Thank you!
Good afternoon, everyone! This is Swati Bajaj
I am an advocate.
I have prepared a module on the topic Shareholders and Creditors Remedies of Personal Actions Derivatives Actions or Class Actions including cases of operation and mismanagement.
Firstly, I will give you an overview of this topic.
Like the shareholders and creditors are the most vital organs of an artificial body called company.
A company can grow only if its shareholders and creditors are happy and satisfied from the working of the company.
As soon the company involved with any misfeasance like oppression or mismanagement, its future starts seeing its nightfall.
So, in this module we will discuss the following topics in detail that is concept of oppression and mismanagement then the minority shareholders vs majority shareholders and then the remedies of shareholders.
This includes three main important remedies that are personal actions, derivative actions and class actions.
Now firstly, we will discuss about the concept of oppression and mismanagement.
Now, the meaning of the term oppression as explained by Lord Copper in Scottish case that is Elder vs. Elder and Watson Limited.
This is case of 1952
This was sighted with the approval of justice WANCHOO of the Supreme Court of India in the case of Shanti Prasad Jain vs. Kalinga Tubes Limited and this is the case of 1965.
The term oppression was explained in this case as the essence of matter seems to be that the conduct complaint of should at the lowest involve a visible departure from the standards of fair delay and a violation of the conditions of fair play on which every shareholder who interest his money to the company is entitle to rely.
This basically explains did you know what whenever a person in a public company whenever a person wants to invest their money in that company then they don't invest blindly they get to know about the company and its affair, its objects in details.
They go through the whole memorandum of association and the article of association and only after satisfying themselves that they are investing in a trusted organisation, they invest their money .
So, in such a case if a person is investing in the company because of this fact and then the suddenly those things get changed after they have invested the money.
So, the main primer unclear (3:01) objective on the basis of which they have invested their money in that company face.
So, in that case this oppression on the part of the company and in this case the shareholders become the victim of that in oppression.
After the term oppression the next term to be explained is the mismanagement.
To explain this term we need an illustration that is arsalan (3:31) case law that is Rajahmundry Electric Supply Corporation versus Nageswara Rao.
This is case of 1956.
It has been decided by the Supreme Court of India.
In this case a petition was brought against a company by certain shareholders on the ground of mismanagement by directors.
The court found that the vice chairman grossly mismanaged the affairs of the company and had drawn considerable amount for his personal purposes.
That large amounts were owing to the government for charges for supply of electricity, that machinery was in a state of disrepair, that the directorate had become greatly attenuated and a powerful local Janta was ruling the roost and that the shareholder outside the group of the chairman was parless to set matters’ right.
This was held to be a sufficient evidence of mismanagement by the Supreme Court of India.
Minority shareholder and Majority shareholder: The group of shareholders in a company is divided into two parts - Majority shareholders and Minority shareholders.
Majority and minority here doesn't mean that the majority like 522 or something like that.
This is not the majority or minority here.
Here, the majority and minority refers to that the majority shareholders are those shareholders who have the controlling power in their hands, controlling power of the company.
They are controlling the affairs of the company and the minority shareholder of the another hands are those who don't have the controlling power, they just have some shares of the company in their own hands.
They have their investment in the company but they are not controlling the affairs of the company.
So, in this case what happen that sometimes these minority share holders who are not in the company, who are not inside the company, they are the outside players of the company so their interest sometimes get neglected because every time they don't bother that what the what the majority shareholders are doing in the company or what’s not.
So, in that case sometime these majority shareholders by abusing their controlling power of the company misuse their power and then the minority shareholders have to suffer.
It is a very very important case on this point and it’s a case of 1843.
It is in this case where the basic principle was laid down by the court and that basic principle has certain exception because the principle is something which was in violation of the interest of the minority shareholders.
So, in that case the basic principle is this but then certain exceptions were given that in which cases this principle cannot be followed.
So, the basic rule which laid down in this case was that the courts will not enter when at the instance of shareholders in matters of internal administration and will not interfere with the management of a company by its directors so long as they are acting within the fast conferred on them under the articles of the company.
Now what we need to understand here is, you know what, then the companies are something which always involved in some competition.
One company is in competition with another company, another companies is in competition with another company and also with the first company.
There is Company Law board; they can settle their disputes by themselves.
There is no need to enter the court or to as a court to settle this disputes now but there are some circumstances where the court’s intervention is required and because this rule is something which is making the minority shareholders more and more week because they cannot challenge the actions of the majority shareholder in the courts because court is not at all allow to intervene in the matters of the company.
So, in such circumstances there are certain exceptions to this also.
Now, it has been stated by Justice Sinha of the Calcutta High Court in Kanika Mukherjee vs. Rameshwar Dayal Dube.
This is the case of 1966.
It was observed or stated by Justice Sinha that the principle imbedded in section 397 and 398 of the Indian companies act which provide for prevention of oppression and mismanagement is an exception to the rule in Foss vs.
Harbottle which lays down the sanctity of the majority rule.
So, we have discussed up till now 3 main points that is the concept of oppression and mismanagement, the concept of minority vs majority shareholders and the rule of Foss vs. Horbottle.
After discussing the 3 main 3 essential points what we came to the conclusion is that this oppression and mismanagement, these are the two atrocious activities we need to be prevented and because these 2 activities are those which are with the members get self indulge in these activities, so in such a case it become very difficult that as we have already told the court should not intervene in the small small disputes of the companies.
So, whether the acts of the majority shareholder of the oppression of mismanagement can be taken in the court by the minority shareholder.
This principle is not accepted by the court in the case of Foss vs. Harbottle.
So, in the case of Foss vs. Harbottle the court says that no, the court should not intervene.
But, in Indian case like; I have told you that the Justice Sinha in the case of Kanika Mukherjee this he did no this rule need some exceptions to it because if it doesn't give an exception to this rule then the interest of the minority shareholder will get violated.
And then the shareholders will know that the person will not become the shareholder in the company and they will not invest in the company and if they will not invest in the company then how the company can be administered.
So, the operation and mismanagement become the exception to this law; Foss vs. Harbottle.
Now, we will discuss the remedies which are available to the shareholders in case of this oppression and mismanagement.
Section 241 of the Companies Act, 2013 provides that any member of a company who complains regarding any oppression or mismanagement being occurred in a company may apply to the tribunal moreover even the Central Government, if of the opinion that the affairs of the company are being conducted in a manner prejudicial to the public interest then it may itself apply to the tribunal for an order.
In this module, we will discuss three different actions which the shareholders can take that is personal action, derivative actions and class action.
Personal action.
in this the shareholder claims their personal rights which arise from the constitution of the company was constitution of the company.
This constitution of the company is memorandum of association and articles of association.
So, the rights with each and every shareholders have which they which right they get from the memorandum of association and articles of association these are the personal rights of the shareholder and the shareholders can claim their those rights without any help from the other any other share holder.
So, these are the personal right and for these personal actions can be taken by the shareholders but however in Indian Companies Law personal actions of the shareholders aggrieved from the acts of oppression or mismanagement do not possess any statutory provision.
Now, we come to another action that is derivative action.
It is a very important.
An interesting area of law is the law governing derivative action which enables the company shareholders of the companies that is means group of shareholders.
To bring in action on behalf of the Company against a third party before a regular Civil Court again there is no specific statutory provision for the derivative action claim in the Indian companies law.
However, the doctrine of derivative action is recognised by the Indian courts.
if a shareholder alleges that are wrong has been done to the company by persons in control thereof he may bring a derivative action where he derives the authority from his corporate right to sue on behalf of the company.
The premise on which the court entertained is extra ordinary form of action is upon the complaining shareholder assertion that the company cannot sue as a persons in control would not bring an action or its behalf for its benefit.
Now, derivative action is basically defined as an action by one or more shareholders of a company where the cause of action is vested in the company and relief is accordingly sort on its behalf.
Since the company has the distinct legal personality with its own rights and liabilities which are different from those personal rights of individual share holders.
This action is brought by shareholder not to enforce his or her own personal right.
I’ll repeat that since the company has a distinct legal personality with its own rights and liabilities which are different from those personal rights of individual shareholders this action is brought by shareholder not to enforce his or her own personal rights but the right and liabilities of the company on its behalf and for the benefit of the company which the company cannot itself do as it is controlled by wrong doers.
In order to be classified as a derivative action the following aspects must be satisfied.
Firstly, it must be brought in a representative form that is though it is a company rather than the other shareholders whom the people initiating the league action / proceedings seek to represent.
By implication of all other shareholders are bound by the result of the action that is a group of shareholders came came together and they file a represented the suit in a representative form.
Here, whatever with a result of that action all the shareholders will get affected by that.
Now, although the action is brought on behalf of the company, the company appears as a defendant so that the action takes the form of a representative action by the initiating shareholders on behalf of himself and all other shareholders [other than the alleged 'wrong -doers'] I mean those shareholders doesn’t include the wrongdoers also and this action is against the alleged wrong doers and the company.
So, shareholders are taking action in a representative form against the company as well as against the wrongdoers and these wrong- doers are the part of the company itself they are also the shareholders of the company.
Now, the derivative action may be brought by shareholder or shareholders in the following instances.
First is ultra vires.
A shareholder may bring an action against the company and its directors in respect of matters which are ultra vires the memorandum of association or the articles of association of the company and which no majority shareholders can sanctioned.
For example directors of the companies sanctioning an action that is contrary to the objects of the company.
So, objects as I must told you that the objects of the company are the basic things on the basis of which the company is trending its building or its business.
If the company fails to satisfy those object that the main purpose for the establishment of that company get failed and then the existence of the company is not at all allowed not even by the court or by the other person associated with a company like its creditors.
Next is the Fraud on Minority.
Directors and the company would also be liable if the conduct of the majority of the shareholders constitutes a 'fraud on minority' that is, a discriminatory action.
For example, where the shareholders have passed a special resolution with an effect of discriminating between the majority shareholders and minority shareholders, so as to give the former an advantage of which the latter were deprived.
I repeat the example again where the shareholders have passed.
These shareholders are the majority shareholders that is shareholders who are in control of the business, where the shareholders have passed a special resolution with an effect of discriminating between the majority shareholder and minority shareholders so as to give the former an advantage of which the later word deprived.
Former is the majority shareholder and the later is the minority shareholder.
So in such cases, this is a fraud it is a fraud on the part of the majority shareholders on the minority shareholders and in such case also the group of minority shareholders in a representative form can take representative at derivative action in the court.
Another is required resolution that is certain actions of the company can be approved only by passing a special resolution at a general meeting of shareholders.
So, if the majority seek to circumvent this legal requirement and pass only an ordinary resolution, or do not pass such a special resolution in the manner required by law, then any member or members can bring an action to restrain the majority.
The majority shareholders and minority shareholders; they both are the part of the company.
The interest of both, the majority as well as the minority shareholder needs to be protected.
So, there is no need for the majority shareholders to take action by themselves and do not involve the minority shareholders with them.
It is their duty that whenever they take any crucial actions which need any special especial resolution and which needs the accent of the minority shareholder they have to get that accent they cannot exclude the minority shareholder that cannot neglect the interest of the minority shareholders.
The another one is to safeguard interest of the company.
For example, an obvious wrong may have been done to the company by the directors but because of the control of such directors on the majority shareholders, such shareholders may not permit an action to be brought against the wrongdoer directors.
Therefore to safeguard the interest of the company any member or members may bring a derivative action.
So, as both the majority shareholders and minority shareholders are liable or as well as responsible for the company.
They are responsible on behalf of the company.
They have to maintain the goodwill of the company.
So, if the minority shareholders of came to the opinion that the acts of the majority shareholders are not in favor of the company or that they are doing any act which is privilege to the interest of the company then in such case minority shareholders can take an action against the majority shareholders for the interest of the company.
Next is the Individual Membership Rights.
As a general rule personal rights for say are not to be enforced through derivative actions.
However, some exceptions have been recognised.
These exception often arise in case of rights that have been conferred upon the shareholders by the company act itself or the respective articles which is known as individual membership rights.
For example, the right to vote, the right to have one's vote recorded or the right to be nominated as a candidate for the post of a director during the election of directors at a General Meeting of the shareholders.
Prevention of oppression and mismanagement a representative action may be brought for prevention of oppression and mismanagement which are cases where the majority acts in a manner that oppress the minority where the majority acts in a manner which oppress the minority or where the affairs of the company are being conducted in a manner pre judicial to the public interest or oppressive to any member or members or in a manner pre judicial to the interest of the company including an adverse material change in the management or control of the company.
Since these proceedings are initiated for the benefit of the company, it can be considered a form of derivative action and find specific place in the scheme of the Indian Company Law under the Companies Act.
In order to obtain relief the company law board can be approached by not less than 100 shareholders or not less than one tenth of the total number of members or members holding not less than one tenth of the issued share capital of the company provided all the dues of the shareholders having by the applicants.
Winding up of the companies, its needs, grounds and effects: As we all are aware of this fact that now we have a new company’s law that is the Companies Act, 2013 and it has replaced and old age companies law of 1956.
In the new Companies Act several new section of provisions were inserted and several old provisions were deleted.
We have total of 470 sections in the new Companies Act, 2013.
Side by topic is winding up of the companies.
So, company is an artificial body.
Artificial as well as an independent body .
So, the question of winding up is very serious where up the persons for coming together to make their companies, to establish their company why they want to wind up their company.
So, winding up is a process whereby the existing companies affairs are brought to an end.
It is a very complex situation where the companies which came into existence in a inspire to grow higher with the passage of each day, in fact each second.
The turn of their entire business and this winding up can be voluntarily as well as can be compulsory.
Voluntary winding up can be understood at the if the members of the companies want to end of their business.
This is genuine, this is natural but where the compulsive binding up came into question than the question is the why, what are the ground, what are the factors with lead up the company to wind up their business.
So, basically, it is a process by which the properties of the company and administer for the benefit of its members and creditors.
You know, companies formed not only but the members there are few person like crediters who invest their own money in the company.
And if they invest their money then obviously they want some good return after that.
further of their investment.
So, whenever a company fails to give them the good return or whenever the company failed to satisfy their creditors than that lead the very complex situation of the companies where they made face the winding up on establishment.
In winding up is also known as the liquidation because here the person appointed for administering the assets and liabilities is called liquidator.
If there is a compulsory winding up the liquidator is appointed by the tribunal that is a company law tribunal under section 275 of the Companies Act, 2013 .
This is new company law.
So, on liquidation the companies name is deleted from the list of the companies by the registrar of companies and the same is published in the official gazette.
I have already told you that there are there two types of winding up: compulsory winding up and voluntary winding up.
Compulsory winding up is also known as winding up by tribunal because there it involves the there is a involvement of tribunal.
Section 270 of the Companies Act, 2013 provide these two modes of winding up.
Now, I will tell you the basic difference between these two modes of winding up compulsory as well as voluntary.
In case of compulsory winding up petition is filed before the Tribunal either by the company or the any creditor or by the contributory or by Registrar or any person authorised by the Central Government on the their behalf.
This is Section 272 of the Companies Act, 2013 which provides the persons who can file petition in the tribunal for the winding up of the company.
Whereas in the case of voluntary winding up section 304 of the Act provides that no petition is required no petition is filed before the court or the Tribunal.
In this case what happens the company passes a special resolution in its meeting or it passes a General Resolution in case of expiry of the period of its duration.
Suppose if a company form for a specific purpose and to compare in the article of as we all note that article of association and memorandum association two important document for the formation of a company.
If they have mentioned that they are establishing their company for a specific purpose and after the completion of that specific purpose they will end up or they will demolish their company then it is a very general or genuine reason that when they complete the specific purpose they will wind up or they will demolish the company.
So, this is the voluntary winding up given in section 304 of the Companies Act, 2013.
Now, in case of compulsory winding up the Tribunal at the passing at the time of passing the order of winding up appoint an official liquidator please note that here is a official liquidator or the liquidator from the panel maintained by the central government.
This is given in section 275 of the Companies Act, 2013 whereas in the case of voluntary winding up the liquidator the companies owned liquidator from the panel prepared by the Central Government.
Here, the panelist of the Central Government but who appoints the liquidator it is the company.
This is given in section 310 of the Companies Act, 2013.
Third difference is in case of compulsory winding up the official liquidator can be removed by the tribunal on the grounds which are mentioned in section 276 of the Act, whereas in the case of voluntary winding up the company liquidator can be removed by the company itself if it is appointed by the company or by the creditor if it is appointed by the creditor on the grounds mentioned in section 311.
Now, as we all know that a company company is established and a company is administered by two main vital organs: one is a member of the company.
They are the directors or the shareholder and another one is the creditors who invest their funds in the company.
So, if the company itself want to wind-up their business then in that case company itself can appoint the liquidator and if the creditors want to wind-up this value business then in that case creditors have the right to remove any company liquidator if they want.
Another main difference is that in case of compulsory winding up the order of winding up of the company shall operate in favour of all the creditors and all contributories of the company as if it had been made out on the joint petition of creditors and contributories, this is given in section 278 of the Companies Act.
While in case the voluntary winding up section 309 says that the company shall from the commencement of the winding up cease to carry on it business, except as far as required for the beneficial winding up of its business.
So, this is the main difference between the compulsory winding and the voluntary winding up as well as two modes of winding up.
it means that the winding up the company can either be compulsory or can either voluntary.
Now, further even the voluntary winding up is of two types.
Again I will repeat the same that a company is administered by two main vital organs one are the members of the company the shareholders and the director and another is a creditors and I have told you that voluntary winding up can be in forced by either the members or the creditors.
So, the voluntary winding up is also having two types: members voluntary winding up and creditors voluntary winding up.
In case of the members voluntary winding up declaration of solvency is made by the directors.
While in case of creditors voluntary winding up there is no need of such declaration.
In case of the members voluntary winding up only meeting of member is called.
While in case of creditors voluntary winding up meeting is of both the member as well as the creditor is called.
In case of members voluntary winding up the liquidator is appointed and remuneration is fixed by the company itself.
While in case of creditors voluntary winding up the liquidator in fact, it appointed by the creditors and remuneration is fixed by the committee of inspection.
In case of members voluntary winding up no committee of infection is appointed and I have already told that in creditors voluntary winding up committee of inspection is appointed.
In case of members voluntary winding up the liquidator can exercise some powers with the sanction of a special resolution of the company, while in case of creditors voluntary winding up the liquidator exercise powers with the sanction of the tribunal.
In case of members voluntary winding up meeting of members is called on completion of procedures of proceedings of winding up in another case that in the case of creditors meeting of members and creditors is called when the proceedings for the winding up has been completed.
So, these are the main difference between the members voluntary winding up and the creditors voluntary winding up.
So, till now we have discussed the concept of winding up, what is the winding up, the two modes of winding up that’s the voluntary winding up and the compulsory winding up and the two further modes of voluntary winding up ,that is members voluntary winding up and the creditors voluntary winding up?
A company came into existence with an aspire of growing higher and higher with an aspire or aim of earning huge and huge profit.
So what are those situation obviously there must be some serious situations serious reason on grounds which force the company to wind up its business.
In voluntary winding up there are no such grounds it shows the willingness of the company to wind up their business but in case of compulsory when the word compulsory rather than it shows that there is some force behind the winding up of the company.
There is not any willingness of the company.
So we will now discuss the grounds of winding up of the compulsory winding up of the company where there is involvement of The Tribunal.
Section 271 of the Companies Act 2013 provide various grounds on the basis of which a petition of can be filed in the Tribunal for the winding up of the company.
The first and the most important ground is that inability to pay debts.
Inability to pay debts itself clearly, clarify its meaning that whenever a company fails to pay its debts.
A company is always having some debts due, because a company is something which runs on the investments made by other persons and their duties and responsibilities of the company to satisfy those investments but if the company fail then what? Obviously if the company fails to pay their debts from the pocket of the company then the consequences have to be suffer by the company itself not by the members.
Members will do only one thing they allow the winding up of the company, they will never pay their debts of the company from the own pocket ,because company is one thing and its member is another thing .
They both are separate bodies.
So in case of inability to pay debts the compulsory have to suffer the consequences and the consequences the petition for the winding up of the company.
Section 271 of and subsection 2 provides it the inability to pay debts primarily arise under three circumstances.
It means when the creditor has made an demand for to the company that their company should pay their debts and from that demand three weeks preceding from the date of demand three weeks have passed then in that, after the completion of those three weeks the creditor can immediately file a petition in the court or Tribunal further winding up of the company.
Second is where execution or other process issued on a decree or order of any court in favour of the company is returned unsatisfied in whole or part.
So if if there is any dispute against the company in the court and a court has passed the decree against the company and company fails to satisfy the decree, then in such a case court can sue motto taken action sue motto plus on any application made by the decree holder.
So the court can proceed for the winding up of the company.
Thirdly, where it is proved to the satisfaction of the court that the company is unable to pay its debts now these three other main circumstances but there is a difference between these three, that in the first two the firstly when the company fails to pay on the demand of the creditor and secondly with the executional unsatisfy in those such cases it doesn't mean the company is lack of funds or the company is unable to pay.
It doesn’t show the unability of the company or the inability of the company is just show that the companies not paying whatever be the reason which is they don't want to pay or there are some personal reason or there can be some bonafide grounds on the base of it they are refusing to pay the amount.
but in the third case it is clearly mentioned that the company is unable to pay its debt.
A petition for winding up on the ground of inability to pay debts must contain all the relevant information about the debt.
The petition must disclose the assets of the company and whether they are sufficient to meet the liabilities including contingent and prospective liabilities.
Further the petition must also disclose the position of fixed assets as well as a valuation of plant and machinery of the company.
Now where a debt is a bonafied disputed by the company and the court is satisfied with a company’s defense a winding up order will not be made.
So even if the creditors or the tribunal itself sue motto had taken an action against the company for the winding of the company it doesn't mean that the company will came to an end.
There can be some bonafide reason on the behalf the company that why they are doing so or why they are not doing so.
So, in case of K Appa Rao vs Sarkar Chemicals Private Limited, the Andhra Pradesh High Court held that where a company has a prime facie sustainable defense or a bonafide dispute of its obligations to discharge the alleged debts of liabilities where the court may not entertain proceeding for the winding up of the company.
And once there is an admission on part of the respondent company of liability of dues payable then a petition under section 273 cannot be dismissed on technical grounds.
Company courts can exercise their discretionary powers of dismissing the petition even before issuing a show cause notice regarding admission.
Further, despite of repeated demands if a company neglects to pay its debts, here the word is company neglects to pay it will be considered as an inability of the company to pay its debts and an order of winding up can be passed by the court.
By non-payment of the undisputed debt within the period of statutory demand the company is deemed unable to pay its debts and where the companies unable to pay its debts, winding up ought generally to follow in public interest.
another ground of winding up a special resolution that is special resolution passed by the company’s member in a board meeting.
A company may by special resolution resolve that it be wound up by the Tribunal The resolution may be passed for any cause whatsoever.
However the Tribunal must see that the winding up is not opposed to public interest or the interest of the company as a whole.
There is a case on this point a New Kerala Chits and Traders Private Limited vs Official Liquidator.
This is the case of 1981 in which it is observed by the Tribunal that a tribunal has a discretion in the matter and under no obligation to order winding up merely because the company has so resolved.
Even or the constitution of India protects the national interest as well as they give the duties to the citizen of the country or the non-citizen also that they must do something in favour of the national interest but not against anything done against the national Law will be condemned.
Here also if the company work against the national interest then is such a case it can be wind up by the Tribunal.
So, if we said that if the company has acted against the interest of sovereignty and integrity of India, the security of the state friendly relations with foreign states, public order, decency or morality.
Then in such a case the company can be wind up by filing a petition in the Tribunal.
Next is the failure of scheme, failure of scheme what is scheme here? Scheme here means that if the scheme of revival and rehabilitation is not approved by the creditors, than the company administrator shall submit a report to the Tribunal within 15 days and the Tribunal shall order for the winding up of the sick company.
The Tribunal, on passing the order of winding up shall conduct the proceedings for winding up in accordance with the provisions of chapter 20 ,that is section 271 sub section 1 clause d.
Another important ground is fraudulent and unlawful affairs.
The term itself explain its meaning that whenever a company conduct any fraudulent and unlawful affairs then in such a case the company the Tribunal never allow the company to continue its business.
If on n application made by the Registrar or any other person authorized by the Central Government by notification and the tribunal is of the opinion that the affairs of the company have been conducted in a fraudulent manner or the company was formed for fraudulent and unlawful purposes or the persons concerned in the formation of management of its affairs having guilty of fraud, misfeasance or misconduct, in connection therewith and that it is proper that the company be wound-up; then such a situation the Tribunal May, on a petition filed by any authorized person can be contributory, can be the Central Government itself or it can be the registrar.
The Tribunal may pass an order for the winding up of the company.
This ground is mentioned in clause E of section 271 sub section 1 of the Companies Act 2013.
Another major ground is default in filing financial statement as we all know that the company has to file a their financial statement with the registrar of the company.
Registrar of the company is a very very important person.
In fact, it is the person who registered the companies list of company’s register.
So if the company has made any default in filing the registrar the it’s financial statement or annual return for immediately preceding five consecutive financial years.
It’s the case of 1882 where a company was formed for the purpose of manufacturing coffee from date under a patent which was to be granted by the government of Germany.
I repeat here the company was formed for the purpose of manufacturing coffee from date under the patent which was to be granted by the government of Germany.
Also for working other patents of similar kind.
The German patent was never granted and the company embarked upon other patents, but on the petition of a shareholder it was held that this substratum of the company had failed and it was impossible to carry out the objects for which it was formed and therefore it was just an equitable that the company should be wound up.
So obviously when a company which is running on a certain rope and if it its balance then a company will automatically fall down.
And other is losses, losses implement that if a company is suffering a loss or if the company is not earning profits.
Situations are different suffering losses is one thing and not earning profit in another thing but when a company cannot carry forward its business except bearing the burden of losses that it is just an equitable for the company to be wind up.
The Bombay High Court observed in the case of Shah Steamship Navigation Company, Re.
Shahs Steamship Navigation Company, Re this case of 1901.
In this case the court has observed that the court will not be justified in making a making a winding up order merely on the ground that the company has made losses, and is likely to make further losses.
Another important risk point is oppression of minority.
That where more than 70% of the company’s funds were being used for object wholly removed from anything within the memorandum and 93% of the shareholders wished to dissociate themselves from the new objects the company was order to be wind up.
Another is the fraudulent purpose.
If the company has been conceived and brought forth in fraud or for illegal purposes, then it is just and equitable to wind up the company.
In Universal Mutual Aid and Poor Houses Association vs A.D.Thoppa Naidu, I repeat Universal Mutual Aid and Poor Houses Association vs A.D Thoppa Naidu the case of 1933.
Here the Madras High Court observed where the main object of a company is to conduct is a conduct of a lottery or any other illegal purpose.
The mere fact that some of its objects were philanthropic will not prevent the company from being order to be wound up as being one form for an illegal purpose.
So, if a company formed for an illegal purposes whose initial whose main or basic objects are illegal ,unlawful then such a case any philanthropic activity or action or nature can will not prevent the company from being order to be wound up.
So, these were the basic grounds on the basis of which the compulsory wound up can take place.
Now we will discuss the consequences of winding order.
when a company who is running since a long time and suddenly they are going to demolish or they are going to wind up their business obviously there are some consequences there are people who have to suffer the loss or the consequences of the winding up.
The main consequences are that order of winding up is deemed to be notice of discharge of the officers, employees and workmen of the company except when the business of the company is continued for the beneficial winding up of the company.
This is given in section 277 sub section 3 of the act.
Another major consequences that all actions and suits against the company are stayed, unless the Tribunal gives leave to continue or commence proceedings.
Further any sort of proceeding pending in any other court shall be transferred to the Tribunal in which the winding up of the company is proceeding.
So these are the major consequences.
Further the order of winding up is operates in the interest of all the creditors and all the contributories, no matter who in fact asked for it, Section 278.
All the powers of the board of directors cease and the same are then exercisable by the liquidator.
On the commencement of winding up the limitation remains suspended in favour of the company till one year after the winding up order is made.
This is given in section 358 of the Companies Act.
Any disposition of the property of the company, and any transfer of shares in the company or alteration in the status of members made after the commencement of the winding up order will be considered as void.
This is given is section 334 of the Companies Act.
Further any attachment, distress or execution put in force, without leave of the Tribunal, against the estate or effects of the company after the commencement of the winding up shall be void ,but not for the recovery of any tax or impost or any dues payable to government.
Further any floating charge created within 12 months immediately preceding the commencement of winding up is void unless it is proved that the company after the creation of the charge was solvent.
Now these were the consequences of compulsory winding up, now the consequences of voluntary winding up.
Three main consequences which have to be faced by the others in case of voluntary winding up, first is effect on the status of company.
The company shall cease to carry on it business accept if it is required to secure a beneficial winding up.
There is a case that is Wills vs Association of Universities of British Common Wealth 
this is the case of 1964.
It was observed in this case that ‘beneficial winding up’ is not confined to financial benefit only.
It may be for reconstruction and the business may have to be carried on so as to facilitate the smooth taking over.
Board’s power to cease: On the appointment of the liquidator, all the power of the board of directors cease and went into the hands of the liquidator.
Then avoidance of transfers, this is section 334 of the act.
All transfers of shares and alterations in the status of members made after the commencement of winding up are void, unless sanctioned by the liquidator or the transfer is made to the liquidator.
Last but not the least discharge of employees, section 334.
A resolution to wind up voluntarily operate as notice of discharge to the employees of the company.
So it was a basic discussion on the topic of winding up of the company, its needs, its grounds and its effects.
Thank you.
Hello everyone!
Welcome to MOOCs Corporate law courses.
I am Vidhi Madan Chadda, working as an Assistant Professor Law at VIPS affiliated to IP University Delhi.
I will be dealing with this module on meetings of the company this module on meetings of companies encompasses the concept of meetings and its significance for an incorporated entity.
This module will particularly delve into the concept of various company meetings and their significance in the conduct of the business of the company and their relevance towards the stakeholders of the company.
The module will further cover the procedural compliances with respect to convening and holding a meeting as required under the provisions of the Company Law, present Company Law that is Companies Act, 2013.
Learning Objectives: To conduct the business of a company and to decide upon various strategies for future various stakeholders have to meet and to decide upon the same.
This module will facilitate the students to understand the concept of company meetings and their benefits.
Different stakeholders in a company interact through various platforms.
Hence, various kinds of companies are convened in a company to transact business of the company.
This module will illustrate these kinds of company meetings like the members meetings, meetings of board of directors; other meeting like creditor meetings and class meetings.
Not every kind of stakeholders’ gatherings constitutes a valid meeting.
Only those meetings which are held in compliance and consonance with the provisions of the Companies Act, 2013 and the rules appended thereto constitute a valid meeting from the point of view of decision making.
The module will deliberate upon such procedures and the rules.
Learning Outcomes: This module will facilitate the students to, number one – understand the concept of company meetings and their significance in the conduct of business of the company.
Further to understand various kinds of company meetings and their importance.
Finally, to understand the procedures to be complied with as per the Companies Act, 2013 and the rules attached for conducting and convening a valid meeting.
Before we move on to the concept of company meetings and their significance let us first understand what exactly we mean by the term company or other meetings.
The term meeting has not been defined under any of the provision of the company legislation whether it is 1956 Act or 2013 Act.
Therefore, the term meeting has has been given various interpretations by the judicial diktat and thereby it has the possibility of having a variety of shapes and used hues.
However, traditionally a meeting constitutes a gathering or coming together of two or more persons for transacting lawful business.
Company Meetings: Every meeting or gathering of stakeholders of a company would not be regarded as a valid meeting for the purpose of taking binding decisions.
Only those meetings of the companies which are convened and held in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act, 2013 and rules like: IT companies meeting of the board and its power rules 2014 and the companies management and administration rules, 2014 are to be considered in order to constitute a valid meeting.
A number of meetings are convened by a company in its due course and I generally classified as meetings of the members, directors meetings and other meetings.
Companies Act, 2013 has also brought about a number of changes in regulation of meetings.
The focus as we know of the Companies Act, 2013 has been to enhance transparency, increase accountability, shareholders democracy and protection of investors’ interest.
Thereby procedural compliances have been simplified like requirement of holding a statutory meeting by a public company at the time of commencement of its business has been done away with.
Further, to give wider to have increased participation by the members of the company.
The concept of e-meeting or other e-voting has been introduced by the Companies Act, 2013.
There can be various kinds of member meetings like: the Annual General Meeting and extra ordinary general meetings.
There can be directors meeting in the form of board meetings and the committee meetings.
The board of directors may constitute committees as required by the Companies Act, 2013 whereby those committees can have hold their meetings.
And there can be other meetings like: class meetings that is of certain class or classes of members and further creditors meetings.
We will begin with the members meeting first and take up Annual General Meetings.
Each year every company is required to hold at least one meeting of its member which is known as an Annual General Meeting.
The only exemption is given to the one-person company from holding such Annual General Meeting.
First Annual General Meeting is required to be held within 9 months from the date of close of first financial year of the company.
This means that a financial year that is from 1st, April to 31st, March each year wherein upon the close of financial year that is 31st, March till 9 months, that is 31st, December, the 1st AGM of the company should be held and then in the first year of incorporation another AGM is not required.
Subsequent Annual General Meetings are required to be held within a period of 6 months from the close of every financial year that is from 31st, March will count these 6 months which come up to 30th, September each year this is the time span within which the Annual General meetings must be held in a company.
There is no extension given if there is any delay in holding the first Annual General Meeting.
However, in cases of subsequent Annual General Meetings, the registrar on sufficient cause being shown by the company may extend the time, period for holding such Annual General Meeting and that is the maximum of 3 months from the time which it was required to hold such meeting.
Provision of the Companies Act also prescribed for the date time and venue on which the meeting is to be held.
An Annual General Meeting can be held on any day except the National Holiday.
Here, by National Holiday we mean that they declared as a National Holiday by the Central Government.
It can be held during the business hours that is 9:00 a.m. to 6 p.m. and such meeting can be held either at the registered office of the company and where the registered office of the company cannot accommodate a vast shareholder base then the meeting can also be held at some other place within the same city, town or village in which the registered office of the company is situated.
Section 102 enlists and lists various businesses which are to be necessarily transacted at an Annual General Meeting.
Such items of or businesses are called as ordinary businesses, that is why some times an Annual General Meeting also called as an ordinary meeting.
Such items which are to be transacted at Annual General Meetings include; number 1 – consideration of financial statements, board reports and auditor reports of the companies.
Declaring dividends if any, appointment of directors of the company and appointment and fixation of salary of the auditors of the company besides these four items of ordinary business that are to be transacted at Annual General meeting.
All other businesses which are to be transacted are called special businesses.
Any all other meetings, if it is required to be convened and held of all the members of a company then it can be held as an Extraordinary General Meeting.
One meeting is to be held at an Annual General Meeting in each year and in case the company requires to hold and take such other decisions which require the assent of the members then in those cases an Extraordinary General Meeting of the members can be convened and held till the time the next AGM is held.
All business transacted at an Extraordinary General Meeting are considered as special businesses, like: we discussed all the businesses besides those which are stated under section, 102 are to be treated as special businesses.
So, all those items can be dealt at Extraordinary General Meetings.
These extraordinary General Meeting can be called by the board of directors.
It can also be called by the board of directors on a requisition being made by the shareholders of the company or in case, the board of directors fail to hold such meetings the shareholders who are making requisitions can also go about holding the meeting, the Extraordinary General Meeting themselves.
And in certain cases the Tribunal can also call such meetings.
The shareholders who are making this requisition for holding an Extraordinary General Meeting must possess, at least one tenth of the paid up share capital of the company and where the companies without share capital in such cases those shareholders must possess at least one tenth of the voting powers of the company.
Only this, this much shareholding or the voting power must be held, that is one tenth must be held by the shareholders who are desirous of making a requisition to the board for holding an Extraordinary General Meeting.
The board of directors when they receipt such valid requisition, recognition of the shareholders is considered as valid when it is in writing and signed by those members who want such requisition must call the Extraordinary General Meeting within 21 days and the date of meeting in any case must not be later than 45 days from such requisition.
They must call a General Meeting upon receipt of acquisition, the Board must call the extraordinary General Meeting within 21days and the date of meeting must not be later than 45 days from the date of receiving such requisition.
In case these deadlines that is 21 days and 45 days are not met by the board of directors.
The shareholders making the requisition for such meeting may go ahead to call and hold shareholders meeting themselves.
They can do so within 3 months from the date of requisition of such meeting.
All the reasonable expenses which are incurred by such requisitioning shareholders for holding such meeting, like: the registered office for holding such meeting, notices are to be given, everything whatever expenses reasonable expensive they make are to be reimbursed to such members by the company.
Such reimbursement is made by the company by detecting such amounts from the fees of the defaulting directors.
The directors which could not make the meeting held within those deadlines.
There have been numerous judicial pronouncements in this regard, like: in LIC of India versus Escorts Limited.
The Supreme Court observed that every shareholder of a company possesses a right to call or to give a requisition for an Extraordinary General Meeting subject to the provisions of the Act.
Once the requisition is made in compliance with the provisions of the Act, the shareholder cannot be restrained from calling such meeting.
Also in R.Chhettiar versus M.Chettiar, the share holders gave a requisition in compliance of the provisions of the Companies Act for removing the Managing Director of the company thereby they wanted to call an Extraordinary General the directors failed to call such meeting with within the prescribed deadlines with time period.
The court held that such a meeting was badly convened.
In certain cases the tribunal may under certain certain circumstances order to hold and convene an extraordinary meeting where it can do so, the tribunal may do so on its own motion or upon receiving an application by the directors on members having the voting rights to call an Extraordinary General Meeting.
The tribunal may give necessary directions to conduct the meeting including the permission for holding one person meetings or through proxy.
There are certain requisites of holding a valid meeting as it stated that in order to convene a meeting or hold a meeting, hold and convene a meeting as prescribed under the provisions and the rules of the act.
The requisites, these requisites are to be complied with in order to transact a valid and binding business for the company.
Notice of the meeting is required to be served to every member of the company, directors of the company and auditors of the company either in writing or through electronic mode; that is through emails.
The notice is required to be served at least 21 days prior to the date of the meeting.
However, the meetings can even be called at a shorter notice then of these 21 days if 95% of the members agree to such shorter notice for a meeting.
The notice must also provide for the date, time and venue of the meeting along with the agenda of the items which are proposed to be transacted at such meeting.
Another requisite for a valid meeting is the quorum.
That is the minimum requirement of number of members present at meetings for conducting a valid meeting.
That means for conducting a valid meeting and transacting a lawful and binding business, minimum number of members are required to attend the meeting so as to constitute quorum of the meeting.
Quorum of the meeting: In case of private company constitutes two members personally present at the meet and in cases of public company where at the date of meeting the membership of the company is up to one thousand members, then the quorum shall be 5 members personally present.
In public companies where at the date of the meeting the the number of members is from 1,000 but up to 5,000 members, in those cases 15 members personally present constitutes the quorum.
In case of public companies having shareholder base at the date of the meeting more than 5,000 members then the quorum shall constitute 30 members personally present at the meeting.
There is a person a person who is required to preside over the meeting and also to orderly convene the meeting such person is called the chairman of the meeting who is elected by show of hands by the members personally present at meeting.
That means at every meeting by show of hands the members among themselves appoint 1 person as chairman who can then preside over the meeting and conduct the business of the meeting.
In cases where a poll is demanded for electing a chairman, the provisions of this present act would apply for holding such a poll and till the time such chairman is appointed the earlier chairman who was appointed by show of hands will continue as the chairman of the meeting.
A member may attend the meeting personally in person that is in person or through a duly appointed proxy.
Duly appointed proxy means a person in his place who can attend the meeting but such proxy must be duly appointed by the member by giving such notice at least 48 hours before the date the time of such meeting in a written form and put after affixing his signature to it.
And such proxy such person who is being authorised by the member can be any person who can attend such meeting.
However, in cases of associations not-for-profit which are set up under Section 8 of the Companies Act, the proxy must also be the member of the company.
That means a member who is appointing a proxy can only appoint another member to participate in the meeting of the company on his behalf.
The proxy however does not possess a right to speak at such meeting nor he is entitled to vote except in case of poll is called.
A member can revoke his proxy by furnishing a notice to that effect that to in writing to the company.
In order to transact the business a meeting is called and for having a decision is being taken at the meeting there is a requirement of voting that means a member can vote against or in favour of a decision.
Members Per se have a Right to Vote.
Such right to vote at the meetings can only be restricted by the articles of the company, when in cases there are shares which are partly paid or there there exist lien on such shares.
Only in those cases the right to vote of the members can be restricted.
Voting can take place by show of hands.
When a resolution or a decision is to be taken at a General Meeting, voting generally takes place by show of Hands by the members unless members requisition for a pole or voting is happening through electronic means.
Such voting by show of hands is evidence through the declaration which is made by the chairman at the end of the meeting and the minutes which provide for such decision is being taken.
Another new initiative that has been taken up by this new Act is allowance of voting which is to be held by electronic means, that means that in order to have maximum participation of the members e-votings are also allowed after the new act coming into being.
The Central Government may prescribe in accordance with rule 20, certain rule 20 of companies management and administration rules, 2014 certain class or classes of company and also the manner in which these companies may vote through the members of these companies may vote through electronic means.
E-voting is to be mandatorily followed according to these rules by the listed companies and also by unlisted companies having more than 1000 .
companies besides these which are mandatory required can also voluntarily allow their members to carry out votings at the meeting through the electronic means.
Demand for a poll, at anytime the poll may be either ordered by the chairman suo moto or may be demanded by the number of person as prescribed under the section where the resolution is to be passed through poll.
The chairman shall require assistance of certain person called the scrutinizes to scrutinize the words that have been made through the polling process and the rules prescribed that is section 109 read with rule 21 of the company’s management and administration rules 2014 prescribed the chairman has the power to regulate the poll in accordance with said rules.
The voting can also take place by the process of postal ballot.
However, following items of business cannot be transacted through the process of postal ballot as they hold higher importance as against other matters, like: the issue of shares with differential rights, the alteration of object clause of the memorandum and the alteration of the main objects of the memorandum, change of place of registered office outside the local limits, buyback of shares of the company, election of the directors and such other matters cannot be passed through a postal ballot.
The decisions taken by the members through voting can be passed either through ordinary resolution, special resolution.
An ordinary resolution is one, when the votes casted in favour exceed the votes casted against them.
Here, the members can either vote in person or through proxy.
Ordinary resolutions are said to be passed to when the votes casted in favour of the decision exceed the votes casted against them that is by simple majority.
Here the members can port either in person, or through their proxy.
The resolutions can also be passed especially where the notice is required to be given in such regard by specifying that it is a special resolution.
The notice must really state that the decision is to be passed at the meeting by special resolution.
Here, the votes casted by the eligible members must be at least three times in favour against the vote casted of such resolution.
And there can be resolution which requires special notice which whereby according to section 115 any such notice is required to be given shall be brought at the instance of the member holding not less than one percent of the total voting power in case of company not having share capital or members holding shares on an aggregate some of exceeding rupees 5 lacs paid up on the date of the notice.
Rule 23 further provides the time and means of sending such special notices for passing the resolution.
The details of the meetings are to be kept in the form of the minutes of the meetings as prescribed under the section and the rules appended and the companies are required to keep and maintain true and fair records of the proceedings of the meetings in the form of minutes in accordance with the act, rules and the secretarial standards as well.
Minutes must be signed by the chairman of the meeting within 30 days of the conclusion of such meeting.
The minutes have the evidentiary value for the proceedings which have taken place at the meetings and thereby recorded in such minutes.
Now, we move on to the meetings of the board of directors wherein board of directors for transacting day to day business activities of the company are required to meet at time intervals as prescribed under the provisions.
Section 173 requires that a board meeting shall be held within 30 days of the incorporation of the company that means within 30 days of incorporation of the company the board of directors are required to meet and hold and convene a board meeting.
Thereafter at least 4 board meetings must be held every year with not more than 120 days gap between two successive board meetings.
So, usually each quarter must have meeting of board of directors.
Such board of director meetings can be either held in person or through video conferencing or any other audio visual means.
That means even the directors who are not personally present at the meeting can take part in the proceedings of the meeting through the availability of these audio visual and video conferencing means.
However, there are certain matters which cannot be dealt through the video conferencing mode.
The notice of all such director meetings must be sent to all the directors at least 7 days prior to the date of the meetings.
However, if all the directors agree to a shorter notice than 7 days as prescribed, they can go ahead with the shorter notice as well for calling such meetings.
Then, there are certain meetings which are held of the committees which are constituted of the board of directors, like: the CSR committee which is required for taking decisions as regards the CSR policy of a company.
It shall comprise such committees, usually comprise of minimal 3 of the directors of one happens to be the independent director.
Such CSR committee meetings have to be held at regular intervals so that they can deliberate upon the CSR policy of the company.
Further there are the audit committee meetings which wherein audit committee happens to be a mandatory committee in case of a listed company and also prescribe classes of public company which require to setup this audit committee for the requirement of seeing the remuneration and taking decisions as regards the auditors of the company; and in such cases the meetings can be held for such audit committee members.
Then, there are nomination and remuneration committee which usually take decision as regards the reasonableness and sufficiency of the level of remuneration which is decided for the board of directors whether it is adequate or not and also their required to hold meetings at regular intervals.
Besides these there are other meetings like class meetings and creditor meetings.
First we will begin with the class meetings.
These are those those company meetings which are held for a particular section of members only.
Only those members which are holding shares of a particular class are required to attend and vote at the meetings to pass such resolutions which become binding upon them.
Such meetings are held only when the rights of such members are to be altered or affected.
For instance, under section 48 of the act wherein the variation of shareholder rights can take place to such class of members are only required to attend such meeting and pass the resolutions by passing a special resolution to this effect.
Then, there are creditors meetings, these type of meetings are held for both secured and unsecured creditors are usually held such creditor meetings are held at the time of approving the scheme of mergers as required under section 232 of the Companies Act, 2013 or at the time and also at the time of company when it is going into voluntary winding up then also the member of the meeting of the creditors are to be held and convened.
Summing up, in this module on company meetings we have covered the concept of concept of meetings and their significance for the conduct of business in a company in an orderly manner.
Various kind of company meetings, like: the member meetings, director meetings, class meetings and creditors meetings; relevance of all such kinds of meetings for the stakeholders of the companies.
The procedural compliances as laid down under the present act and rules appended thereto are discussed for which are required for convening a valid meeting for purposes of taking valid and binding decisions of the company.
Thank you.
Hello everyone!
welcome to MOOCs corporate law course.
I'm Vidhi Madaan Chadda working as an Assistant Professor law at VIPs affiliated to IP University Delhi.
I will be dealing with the module on types of companies.
This module on types of companies is in continuation to the incorporation process wherein the students will get to know about the various kinds of companies which can be incorporated in the Indian context.
The focus of the module would be to discuss the benefits and the nature of these kinds of companies.
The module will further delve into the nature and functioning of these kinds of companies along with their procedural requirements for incorporation.
The objectives of this module would be to understand various kinds of companies, their nature and the relevance for choosing such forms of businesses.
Further, it would make the students understand that what are the legal provisions and the regulatory Framework governing these kinds of companies under the Indian Company legislations.
Also on what basis these companies can be classified.
Further, the differences in natures and kinds in their kinds can be enunciated.
The learning outcomes of this module would be that is it will enable the students to understand various kinds of companies and their classification.
It will make them understand the features of each of these kinds of companies along with the benefits of incorporating and choosing such forms of business structures and they will understand the differences in their nature and structure of these companies.
We'll start with the introduction and overview of the module, that is, various business structures can come into existence and be opted for depending upon their size, nature, scope and membership in an organization.
Incorporation makes an entity, a distinct person in the eyes of law; having perpetual succession, power to acquire, hold, dispose of the property in its own name, to sue and be sued in its own name by virtue of section 9 of the Companies Act 2013.
The companies in India can either be incorporated under the Companies Act 2013 or under any previous legislations like the Companies Act 1956 and or under the special legislation prescribing for the setting up of these companies.
The choice between incorporating a public company or a private company is generally based upon a number of factors like scale of operations, sources of funds, autonomy needed, flexibility of operations and such other kinds.
These kinds of companies can be loosely categorized on or rather classified on different basis.
They can be classified on the basis of their incorporation; they can be either registered as a statutory company or a registered company; they can be classified on the basis of membership like it can be a public company or a private company or a one person company.
They can be categorized on the basis of their liability that is unlimited company, company limited by shares or company limited by guarantee or company or unlimited company; then there can be other companies like holding and subsidiary companies, government company, foreign company and few new types of companies which are introduced by the Companies Act 2013 like the associate companies, the dormant companies and so on.
Section 3 subsection 1 of the Companies Act 2013 provides for the incorporation and registration of three kinds of companies namely public company, private company and one person company.
We’ll start with private companies first.
Private company is a company which is incorporated with a minimum number of two members for carrying out any lawful activity.
Earlier under the previous company law that is Companies Act 1956 there was a requirement of minimum authorized capital Rs. 1 lakh which has been done away with the coming of Companies Amendment Act of 2015 any minimum prescribed, authorized capital.
Private company unlike the public ones are from inviting deposits of funds from the public or accepting funds from the public at large; hence this company companies enjoy a number of privileges in the form of relaxation from compliances.
There is a requirement of having minimum to directors on the board of private companies.
There are a number of privileges that accrue to a private company.
They can be that they are not required to appoint an independent director or a woman director on their board.
They are not required to required to retire a a proportion of their directors each year.
The provisions of voting regulations like quorum, notice cannot be complied with stricter senso, and they can have their own internal regulations as prescribed by the articles of the company.
They are not required to prepare report for the annual general meetings and there is no need for having a secretarial audit for private companies.
Companies Act 2013 has introduced two other types, two new types rather of private companies; that is a one-person company and a small company.
We’ll start with one-person company first; it is a new concept that is introduced whereby a small or a micro entrepreneur can now be in a position to convert their proprietorship firm a small unit into a corporate entity, a corporate setup without worrying about number of or other Complex compliance regime or procedural requirements which are set out under the company legislations.
There are a number of benefits which accrue to one-person company.
They are that these kind of companies are not required to hold any annual general meetings or extraordinary general meetings.
They are not required to appoint any independent directors on their board, only two board meetings in a calendar year, that is, each meeting in the half year is what they are required to hold for the board of directors and further they are not required to prepare a cash flow statement as a part of their financial statements.
Next or rather another kind of new private company, or business firm that has been introduced by the Companies Act 2013 is a small company.
The ideology behind setting up of the small company was to give some relief to the small business setups, small entities given them flexibility of operation, flexibility by giving them simplified procedures and statutory compliances for their internal regulation.
The small companies are a private company which are usually categorized as small on the basis of their turnover and the paid-up share capital.
A small company means a company which is other than a public company where the paid-up share capital does not exceed Rs.50 lacs and such higher amount that may be prescribed but it cannot be at any time be more than 5 crores or the of which as per the last profit and loss account does not exceed Rs.
2 crores or such higher amount as may be prescribed but it cannot be more than 20 crores at any point in time.
There are number of benefits which are given to small companies in terms of regulatory relaxations and lesser compliance requirements like they are not required to appoint more than two directors on their board.
They are not required to appoint independent or women directors.
The report of an annual general meeting is not to be prepared, also the preparation of cash flow statement as a part of financial statements is not required.
We move on to another type of company that can be incorporated that is a public company.
A public company is an association of 7 or more members who subscribe to the memorandum and there is no limit that, that is, the maximum limit on the number of members a public company can have.
There is no requirement after the Amendment Act of 2015 on the public companies as regards the authorized capital.
Earlier, the act prescribed for a limit of Rs.5 lacs as authorized Capital.
Public companies have to affix the word Limited after their name.
all the companies except the private companies are called the public once.
After the Companies Act 2013 undoubtedly the requirement and the standards for transparency, accountability, governance have increased.
This in turn has increase the number of compliances a public company has to undergo.
Few of the compliances like appointment of independent directors, women directors, formation of various committees like nomination committee, remuneration committee etc cetera, then appointment of whole time directors, key managerial personnel, requirement of secretarial audit to name a few.
The increased compliance cost plays down heavily upon these public companies which are held by smaller group of shareholders.
When the smaller group of shareholders have to be at the brunt of these exemplary compliance cost is cost as per the new act, they prefer, the data shows that they have been preferring to move to another simpler business forms like the limited liability partnership or a private company.
Thus, today a number of public companies having smaller shareholding base find it feasible to convert themselves either into a private company or a limited liability partnership to enhance their operating efficiency.
All these companies, private, public, one-person, small can be either incorporated as a company limited by share, a company limited by guarantee or an unlimited company.
A company limited by share is a company wherein the liability of the members is limited to the extent of the amount which remains unpaid upon their shares.
Thus, the liability arises only in cases of partly paid shares; for instance, a person A is a shareholder in a company whereby he purchases rupee 10 share in that company.
The company till now has called only Rs.8 from that particular shareholder A.
So that means Rs.2 remains balance and his liability towards the company.
So it only in cases of partly paid shares the company can ask to pay up the full amount on those shares the shareholder has prescribed for.
In cases of company limited by guarantee the liability of the members is limited to the extent they undertake to contribute towards the assets of the company but this liability arises only at the time of liquidation or winding up of the company.
It cannot arise any time before it.
Such kinds of companies may or may not have share capital.
Further, there are companies which can have unlimited liability for their members wherein the members become personally liable to discharge the liability of the company even through their personal assets.
However, the members cannot be sued in their personal capacities and their liability also arises at the time of winding up only.
The basic difference between a member of an unlimited company and a partner of a partnership firm is that a partner of a partnership firm has joint and several liability and he can be sued personally by the claimants whereas as the member of an unlimited company though has an unlimited liability but cannot be sued in his personal capacity by the claimants.
Moreover, at any time the unlimited company can convert itself into a limited company either limited by shares or guarantee.
Then we move onto another kinds of companies which can be setup in India.
There are foreign companies which can be called as a company or a body corporate which are though incorporated outside India but have a presence in India.
This presence in India can be through a place of business in India or by conducting any business activity in India.
This place of business in India can be either through itself, its agent physically or in electronic mode.
Rule 3 of Companies Registration Offices and Fees Rules they have defined the term business activity and chapter 22 of the act they contain section 379 to Section 393 which deal with foreign companies and the procedures they required to follow.
Every foreign company which establishes a place of business is India is required to get registered and file their application in the form prescribed with the registrar of companies pursuant to section 380.
Further, the Indian office of that foreign company is required to prepare a statement of account and shall also cause them to be submitted with the registrar in pursuance of section 381 of the act.
Another kind of company is the government company as prescribed under section 2 subsection 45 of Companies Act 2013.
Government company is a company which has the holding of Central, state or both these governments.
It is a company wherein the Central government the State government or both Central or State or only state government has more than 51% of the paid up share capital; that means these governments hold more than 51% stake in a government company.
And a subsidiary company of a government company is also called as a government company.
Though it has the Holding and control of a government however, it can such companies government companies can at anytime be not equated as state as prescribed under article 12 of the Constitution of India.
There are a number of judicial pronouncements to this effect that the government companies cannot be regarded as a state nor the employees of the government companies be regarded as government employees.
Further, there are another set of companies is called holding and subsidiary companies.
Two companies are called holding and subsidiary of each other when they have a relationship whereby one company possesses and exercises control over the other.
The company which possesses and exercises its control over another company is called the holding company and the company upon which such control is exercised is called the subsidiary company.
The control is set to be exercised by controlling the composition of the board in such another company or by exercising or controlling more than one half of the total share capital in such another company.
Another new concept which has been brought about by the Companies Act 2013 is a concept of associate company.
This new concept is introduced to bring about clarity and transparency in the relationship that two companies share besides the holding and subsidiary relationship.
A company is called as an associate of another when it possesses significant influence over that other company.
The significant influence can be read in terms of the control which is exercised by holding more than or rather at least 26% of the total share capital in that company.
This means that two companies can, wherein one company be associate of another wherein one company is in a position to control the other company or have significant influence over the other company by having at least 26% of the total share capital in that company.
A joint venture can also be covered under the definition of associate company; however, it must not be subsidiary of the company exercising such influence.
Associate company is also considered as a relative in related party transactions under the act.
There are another set of companies which are prescribed under the Companies Act 2013 wherein the companies are per se>(/?) not setup to earn profits or make profits rather they are set up for the purposes of earning for the purposes of furtherance of objects like charitable, religious, educational, social and welfare causes.
These companies are not required to affix the words Private Limited or limited after their names but they acquire their status as an association not for profit only after they procure a license from the central government.
Such companies are given a number of privileges in terms of flexibility of governance and lesser compliances and they are required to convert into some other form only after they are permitted by the central government The members of such companies do not get dividend as their return.
Another kind of companies which are introduced by the Companies Act 2013 are called the dormant companies whereby certain companies which although formed and registered under the act can be given a status of dormant whereby their incorporated for a future project or only to hold an asset or any intellectual property or they have no significant accounting transaction or in case they are inactive company.
And inactive company implies a company which has not been carrying out any business or operation or has not made any significant accounting transaction in the last two financial years or has not filed its statements or annual returns during two financial years.
This means then means that certain companies which are not very active can secure the status of dormant companies to lessen down their compliance requirement.
Such inactive companies have to apply to the registrar of companies to get this dormant status; however; there is no embargo upon these dormant companies from securing and active status anytime later.
Then there are certain companies called the investment companies as provided under Explanation A, to Section 186.
These investment companies have the principal business to acquire securities and further deal in shares and securities.
The earning source for these companies is through the income of dividend or interest which is earned by dealing in the securities or buying and selling of these securities.
One of the latest initiatives in the Indian context is the is towards setting ups these startups.
There has been a clarification provided by the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion wherein the notification provides that a startup entity can only be set up in the form of a private company or a partnership firm or a limited liability partnership.
Moreover, a startup can only be called as one for the first 5 years of its setting up or incorporation or till the time the turnover remains within the cap of Rs. 25 crores during five financial years.
This means that the startups can either be formed as a private company or a partnership firm or a limited liability partnership wherein under the various business forms that we have discussed a startup may choose from these smaller business setups to start functioning.
Summing up, in this module on types of companies we have covered the nature and kinds of these companies which are available of people who are desirous of setting up their business in the Indian scenario.
The benefits of choosing such business forms over the other available options, the procedural requirements for incorporating each of these business setups, and the changes which have been brought about by the Companies Act towards their regulation and certain new forms of business structures like associate companies, one person companies, dormant companies which have been introduced by this present new act.
moving ahead another important term that is called manager.
Manager is defined and it is very significant.
The definition if you read it says an individual, so it is a person, it is a individual who subject to the superintendence, control and direction of the board of directors has the management of the whole or substantially the whole of the affairs of the company and it is important to note.
Here, that what matters is not a person is described as a manager but what he is exercising substantial part of powers of a management.
It is very important to note here.
So, there are three important things which we noting that he must be an individual, it cannot be a company form or other things and he is subject to superintendence control and direction of the Board of Directors.
So, he cannot act independently on its own it has to be always under the superintendence, control and direction of the board of directors and thirdly that he has is the management of whole or substantially the whole of the affairs of the company.
With what does it mean? It means that he is the whole soul in charge.
A shop manager or a factory manager cannot be a manager under the act.
There is no need that manager must be an employee of the company.
So, there is no specific need but he must be an individual.
He must have substantially the whole management of the affairs of a company and must be acting on the superintendence, control and direction of the board.
Now it, I have already pointed out that it cannot be a firm a body corporate or association of person and here we refer to Section 196 of the Companies Act, 2013 and in as far as the manager's role is concerned I would direct you to read this particular decision.
It is pretty interesting decision CIT Kerala versus Alagappa Textiles AIR, 1980 Supreme Court 235.
That in fact this Supreme Court decision in detail discusses this concept of the manager and section 2(53) of the Companies Act, 2013 defines manager and that is what we have seen the definition and right now.
And 3 important points which must be considered as for the definition of Manager is concerned.
Now, let us come down to another term that is called Managing Director.
Now, this Managing Director is an important term and here we need to distinguish it with the manager and here if you see it says a director who is entrusted with substantial powers of management of the affairs of a company by virtue of what, by virtue of three things one either the same thing is mentioned in the articles of association of a company or by way of an agreement with the company or a resolution passed to this regard in a General Meeting by the Board of Directors or by its board of directors through authorisation to General Meetings.
So, they are the 3 modes by which a Director become a Managing Director.
But here it is important to know that the Managing Director is not acting under the supervision or control of board of director.
He is independent in this regard.
That is what we saw in case of manager he has to work under the superintendence, control and supervision of the board of directors.
Secondly, the Managing Director holds the position by virtue of being a director.
So, if he is not a director then he cannot be a managing director.
But, in case of manager it is not like that.
In case of manager he holds the position in his own right as an appoint appointed person as a manager and while Managing Director essentially has to be director before where as manager can continue to be a manager whether or not he holds the office of a director that is what is the distinction I made just now?Now, let us come down to the whole time director.
Now, section 2(94) of the Companies Act, 2013 defines whole time director and it says it includes a director in the whole time employment of a company and it may be noted that the director may be appointed as a chief executive officer, manager, company secretary or chief financial officer, if so provided in the articles of association of a company and would then be treated as the whole time director.
So basically, whole time director means a person or a director who is in the whole time employment of a company.
He has to devote full time or full time to the company and he can be designated, he can be appointed as Chief Executive Officer or Manager a Company Secretary or Chief Financial Officer.
So, this is what is about whole time director.
Now, there is a concept of Company Secretary and if we see the Company Secretary is defined.
If CS is appointed by a company to perform the functions of a Company Secretary under the Companies Act and every listed company and others having a paid up capital of 5 crores or more will have to appoint a Company Secretary.
That is what we have seen previously and though the secretary’s duties are largely of a ministerial or administrative nature.
We must be knowing about the company secretaries duty it plays a very important role in corporate governance.
Corporate governance basically you know that you have a proper accounting and accountability towards the shareholders and this company secretary defined in section 224 and this draws the definition from the company secretaries act and which means a person who is a member of the Institute of Company Secretaries of India.
So, he is a company secretary basically.
Then, there is a term called CFO that is Chief Financial Officer and these are very important term defined in section 219 of the Companies Act and if you see CFO means a person appointed as the Chief Financial Officer of a company.
So here, you can make a distinction between CFO and CEO.
In CEO we saw he is a designated person designated officer of a company where CFO is appointed as Chief Financial Officer of a company.
So, he is an officer who is appointed.
He is not just designated like CEO.
So, it basically says core management team.
What is core management team? This does not include board of directors because board of directors is excluding that is a policy making body of a company.
So, it comprises of all members of the management just one Level below to the executive director.
So, that is basically these are all functional heads who are there and who will be heading the functional units of or you can say SBU’s of the company and they will be dealing with the management, core management of the company.
So, these are the terminologies and this is what are important types of terminologies which we see? Now, let us come down to types of directors.
Now, section 149 of the Companies Act says company needs to have a board of directors.
Now which are they? The board of directors generally the composition of the board of directors includes executive and non executive directors; we will see what is the distinction between executive and non executive directors.
Now, the differentiation which stands between the executive and non executive directors is by way of corporate governance principles.
If you recollect the executive and non executive directors were not exactly defined under Companies Act.
They take their particular definition or this concept has an emergence from corporate governance principles wherein they say that the management of the company must have at least 50% of the board of members who are non executive means they are not part of the day –to-day activities or policy making of a company.
This was under clause 49 of listing agreement previously.
But now what has happened is, is listing agreement has now been replaced with SEBI regulations and this SEBI listing obligations and disclosure requirement actually talks about listing regulations.
And regulation 17 provides for the board of directors which mandates the similar thing that is 50% of the board must comprise of non-executive directors.
You would be aware about the number of directorship which company must have and minimum and maximum numbers.
So, as per the types of companies you know one person company there is one minimum director and maximum can be 15.
Similarly, for private company there must be minimum two directors and maximum 15 and for public company minimum is 3 directors and maximum can be 15 and in case of producer companies which is a interesting addition in the Companies Act, 2013.
Though not edition we can say this has been actually taken from 1956 Act and re-introduced into the 2013 Act exactly have must have a minimum of 5 directors and maximum of 15 directors.
Now, here these directorship can be increased more than 15 if they want but for that they have to pass a special resolution and by way of that only that it can be increased these are the types of directors which we are talking about.
Now, let us exactly talk about different terms which are used in context of types of director.
Now, let to begin with let us come down to executive and non executive directors.
I have talked about this a bit briefly in the previous slide.
Not let us talk about in detail it says the term executive director has been defined to mean a whole time director as per are the companies specification of definition detail rules 2014.
So, who is executive director? Executive director means a whole time director and who is the whole time director? We have seen the definition previously that he is a director who is in the whole time employment of a company.
So, basically executive directors in whole time employment of a company.
Now, the difference between the executive and non executive director lies in their being internal and external to the organisation and their involvement in day-to-day management of the company that is where I drew the distinction upon and as per the Kumar Mangalam Birla Committee report on Corporate Governance.
This was one of the important reports which laid down the foundations for corporate governance.
We see the executive directors like: Director Finance, Director Personnel are involved in day-to-day management of the companies.
The non executive directors bring external and wider perspective and Independence to the decision making and that is where we say the difference between executive and non executive directors of the board.
Always needs to be a Non Executive Director but again there is a composition thing here, if it is 50%, 50%, 50% are executive and 50% are non executive then chairman of the board needs to be a non executive.
What if it is two third compositions is executive, non executive and one third is non executive, executive.
Then, in that particular situation chairman can be a non executive.
So, it depends upon the composition.
Idea is that there should be ideal balance between the executive and non executive directors.
Independent directors.
Now this is a very significant definition and if you see section 149(6) of the Act talks about independent directors And Companies Act, 2013 has brought a very detailed proposition for independent directors and they have laid down their duties and responsibilities of independent directors which was not there in the previous Companies Act and that is why you can see the role of independent directors in scandals like: Satyam has been brought to for that independent directors did not act and there was no responsibility statement for these particular independent directors and that is why these changes have been made under the Companies Act 2013 and we see that an independent director has been exhaustively defined to mean a director other than the managing director or a whole time director or a nominee director.
So, these are not independent directors because they will have some stake or interest in the company.
For example Managing Director will be managing the affairs.
So, he cannot be independent.
Whole time director will be the employment of the company, so he cannot be independent.
Similarly nominee director will be representing the interests of the entity for which, which it is a nominee.
So it will not be independent, hence they cannot be independent directors.
An independent director in the opinion of the board is a person of integrity and possesses relevant expertise and experience.
Now, these are the two terms which are very important he must have, he should be a person of integrity, though objective because we cannot define what is integrity and possess relevant expertise and experience .
So, that is why there are lot of training happening on independent Directors, IOD portal, all those particular things do independent directors training .
Further he is a person who is or was not a promoter of a company or its holding subsidiary or associate company and he is also not related to promoters of directors in company, its holding subsidiary or associate company.
Moving ahead, independent directors must not have any pecuniary relationship.
On this, there is a big focus because it says that it must not have a pecuniary relationship with the company, its holding, subsidiary of associate company or their promoters or directors during the two immediate preceding financial years or during the current financial year.
So, he must not have a pecuniary interest because their stems the Independence.
If he is having a pecuniary interest then definitely he cannot be independent, then and also one of whose relatives has or had pecuniary relationship or transaction with the company, its holding and subsidiary, or their promoters or director.
So, relatives are also not allowed too.
Amounting to what is the pecuniary transaction? Pecuniary transaction is 2% or more of its gross turnover or total income or 50 lakh rupees or such higher amount as may be prescribed.
So, it can be less than 2% like for example that is not significant pecuniary relationship.
For example somebody has got a gift from a company like a small gift of rupees 5000 rupees.
Now, that cannot be 2% of the turnover or it cannot be 50 lakh rupees so that cannot be treated as independent directors.
So, it is said that, that is not a significant pecuniary relationship to influence the decision of a director.
There are ethical issues here.
But we are not going to discuss that here because that is something which is dealt with by secretarial standards and that is not the purport of this particular session.
We will discuss it sometime next and this is what is important? So, one is relationship.
It should be independent, integrity and pecuniary relationship should not be there.
What is (are) Adult Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia ?

Key Points
- Adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) is a type of cancer in which the bone marrow makes too many lymphocytes ( a type of white blood cell )    .
- Leukemia may affect red blood cells , white blood cells , and platelets    .
- Previous chemotherapy and exposure to radiation may increase the risk of developing ALL    .
- Signs and symptoms of adult ALL include fever , feeling tired , and easy bruising or bleeding    .
- Tests that examine the blood and bone marrow are used to detect ( find ) and diagnose adult ALL    .
- Certain factors affect prognosis ( chance of recovery ) and treatment options    .
Adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) is a type of cancer in which the bone marrow makes too many lymphocytes ( a type of white blood cell )    .
Adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ; also called acute lymphocytic leukemia ) is a cancer of the blood and bone marrow    .
This type of cancer usually gets worse quickly if it is not treated    .
Leukemia may affect red blood cells , white blood cells , and platelets    .
Normally , the bone marrow makes blood stem cells ( immature cells ) that become mature blood cells over time    .
A blood stem cell may become a myeloid stem cell or a lymphoid stem cell    .
A myeloid stem cell becomes one of three types of mature blood cells : - Red blood cells that carry oxygen and other substances to all tissues of the body    .
- Platelets that form blood clots to stop bleeding    .
- Granulocytes ( white blood cells ) that fight infection and disease    .
A lymphoid stem cell becomes a lymphoblast cell and then one of three types of lymphocytes ( white blood cells ) : - B lymphocytes that make antibodies to help fight infection    .
- T lymphocytes that help B lymphocytes make the antibodies that help fight infection    .
- Natural killer cells that attack cancer cells and viruses    .
In ALL , too many stem cells become lymphoblasts , B lymphocytes , or T lymphocytes    .
These cells are also called leukemia cells    .
These leukemia cells are not able to fight infection very well    .
Also , as the number of leukemia cells increases in the blood and bone marrow , there is less room for healthy white blood cells , red blood cells , and platelets    .
This may cause infection , anemia , and easy bleeding    .
The cancer can also spread to the central nervous system ( brain and spinal cord )    .
This summary is about adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia    .
See the following PDQ summaries for information about other types of leukemia : - Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Treatment    .
- Adult Acute Myeloid Leukemia Treatment    .
- Childhood Acute Myeloid Leukemia / Other Myeloid Malignancies Treatment    .    - Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Treatment    .
- Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia Treatment    .
- Hairy Cell Leukemia Treatment    .
What are the symptoms of Adult Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia ?

Signs and symptoms of adult ALL include fever , feeling tired , and easy bruising or bleeding    .
The early signs and symptoms of ALL may be like the flu or other common diseases    .
Check with your doctor if you have any of the following : - Weakness or feeling tired    .
- Fever or night sweats    .
- Easy bruising or bleeding    .
- Petechiae ( flat , pinpoint spots under the skin , caused by bleeding )    .
- Shortness of breath    .
- Weight loss or loss of appetite    .
- Pain in the bones or stomach    .
- Pain or feeling of fullness below the ribs    .
- Painless lumps in the neck , underarm , stomach , or groin    .
- Having many infections    .
These and other signs and symptoms may be caused by adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia or by other conditions    .
How to diagnose Adult Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia ?

Tests that examine the blood and bone marrow are used to detect ( find ) and diagnose adult ALL    .
The following tests and procedures may be used : - Physical exam and history :
An exam of the body to check general signs of health , including checking for signs of disease , such as infection or anything else that seems unusual    .
A history of the patient 's health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken    .
- Complete blood count ( CBC ) with differential :
A procedure in which a sample of blood is drawn and checked for the following : - The number of red blood cells and platelets    .
- The number and type of white blood cells    .
- The amount of hemoglobin ( the protein that carries oxygen ) in the red blood cells    .
- The portion of the blood sample made up of red blood cells    .
- Blood chemistry studies :
A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body    .
An unusual ( higher or lower than normal ) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease    .
- Peripheral blood smear :
A procedure in which a sample of blood is checked for blast cells , the number and kinds of white blood cells , the number of platelets , and changes in the shape of blood cells    .
- Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy :
The removal of bone marrow , blood , and a small piece of bone by inserting a hollow needle into the hipbone or breastbone    .
A pathologist views the bone marrow , blood , and bone under a microscope to look for abnormal cells    .
The following tests may be done on the samples of blood or bone marrow tissue that are removed : - Cytogenetic analysis :
A laboratory test in which the cells in a sample of blood or bone marrow are looked at under a microscope to find out if there are certain changes in the chromosomes of lymphocytes    .
For example , in Philadelphia chromosome positive ALL , part of one chromosome switches places with part of another chromosome    .
This is called the Philadelphia chromosome    .
- Immunophenotyping :
A process used to identify cells , based on the types of antigens or markers on the surface of the cell    .
This process is used to diagnose the subtype of ALL by comparing the cancer cells to normal cells of the immune system    .
For example , a cytochemistry study may test the cells in a sample of tissue using chemicals ( dyes ) to look for certain changes in the sample    .
A chemical may cause a color change in one type of leukemia cell but not in another type of leukemia cell    .
What is the outlook for Adult Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia ?

Certain factors affect prognosis ( chance of recovery ) and treatment options    .
The prognosis ( chance of recovery ) and treatment options depend on the following : - The age of the patient    .
- Whether the cancer has spread to the brain or spinal cord    .
- Whether there are certain changes in the genes , including the Philadelphia chromosome    .
- Whether the cancer has been treated before or has recurred ( come back )    .
Who is at risk for Adult Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia? ?

Previous chemotherapy and exposure to radiation may increase the risk of developing ALL    .
Anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor    .
Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer ; not having risk factors doesnt mean that you will not get cancer    .
Talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk    .
Possible risk factors for ALL include the following : - Being male    .
- Being white    .
- Being older than 70    .    - Past treatment with chemotherapy or radiation therapy    .
- Being exposed to high levels of radiation in the environment ( such as nuclear radiation )    .
- Having certain genetic disorders , such as Down syndrome    .
What are the stages of Adult Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia ?

Key Points
- Once adult ALL has been diagnosed , tests are done to find out if the cancer has spread to the central nervous system ( brain and spinal cord ) or to other parts of the body    .
- There is no standard staging system for adult ALL    .
Once adult ALL has been diagnosed , tests are done to find out if the cancer has spread to the central nervous system ( brain and spinal cord ) or to other parts of the body    .
The extent or spread of cancer is usually described as stages    .
It is important to know whether the leukemia has spread outside the blood and bone marrow in order to plan treatment    .
The following tests and procedures may be used to determine if the leukemia has spread : - Chest x-ray :
An x-ray of the organs and bones inside the chest    .
An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film , making a picture of areas inside the body    .
- Lumbar puncture : A procedure used to collect a sample of cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) from the spinal column    .
This is done by placing a needle between two bones in the spine and into the CSF around the spinal cord and removing a sample of the fluid    .
The sample of CSF is checked under a microscope for signs that leukemia cells have spread to the brain and spinal cord    .
This procedure is also called an LP or spinal tap    .
- CT scan ( CAT scan ) : A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of the abdomen , taken from different angles    .
The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine    .
A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly    .
This procedure is also called computed tomography , computerized tomography , or computerized axial tomography    .
- MRI ( magnetic resonance imaging ) : A procedure that uses a magnet , radio waves , and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body    .
This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging ( NMRI )    .
There is no standard staging system for adult ALL    .
The disease is described as untreated , in remission , or recurrent    .
Untreated adult ALL
The ALL is newly diagnosed and has not been treated except to relieve signs and symptoms such as fever , bleeding , or pain    .
- The complete blood count is abnormal    .
- More than 5 % of the cells in the bone marrow are blasts ( leukemia cells )    .
- There are signs and symptoms of leukemia    .
Adult ALL in remission
The ALL has been treated    .
- The complete blood count is normal    .
- 5 % or fewer of the cells in the bone marrow are blasts ( leukemia cells )    .
- There are no signs or symptoms of leukemia other than in the bone marrow    .
What are the treatments for Adult Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia ?

Key Points
- There are different types of treatment for patients with adult ALL    .
- The treatment of adult ALL usually has two phases    .
- Four types of standard treatment are used : - Chemotherapy - Radiation therapy - Chemotherapy with stem cell transplant - Targeted therapy - New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials    .
- Biologic therapy - Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
- Patients can enter clinical trials before , during , or after starting their cancer treatment    .
- Patients with ALL may have late effects after treatment    .
- Follow - up tests may be needed    .
There are different types of treatment for patients with adult ALL    .
Different types of treatment are available for patients with adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL )    .
Some treatments are standard ( the currently used treatment ) , and some are being tested in clinical trials    .
A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer    .
When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment , the new treatment may become the standard treatment    .
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment    .
The treatment of adult ALL usually has two phases    .
The treatment of adult ALL is done in phases : - Remission induction therapy :
This is the first phase of treatment    .
The goal is to kill the leukemia cells in the blood and bone marrow    .
This puts the leukemia into remission    .
- Post - remission therapy :
This is the second phase of treatment    .
It begins once the leukemia is in remission    .
The goal of post - remission therapy is to kill any remaining leukemia cells that may not be active but could begin to regrow and cause a relapse    .
This phase is also called remission continuation therapy    .
Treatment called central nervous system ( CNS ) sanctuary therapy is usually given during each phase of therapy    .
Because standard doses of chemotherapy may not reach leukemia cells in the CNS ( brain and spinal cord ) , the cells are able to &quot ; find sanctuary &quot ; ( hide ) in the CNS    .
Systemic chemotherapy given in high doses , intrathecal chemotherapy , and radiation therapy to the brain are able to reach leukemia cells in the CNS    .
They are given to kill the leukemia cells and lessen the chance the leukemia will recur ( come back )    .
CNS sanctuary therapy is also called CNS prophylaxis    .
Four types of standard treatment are used :
Chemotherapy Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells , either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing    .
When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle , the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body ( systemic chemotherapy )    .
When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid ( intrathecal chemotherapy ) , an organ , or a body cavity such as the abdomen , the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas ( regional chemotherapy )    .
Combination chemotherapy is treatment using more than one anticancer drug    .
The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated    .
Intrathecal chemotherapy may be used to treat adult ALL that has spread , or may spread , to the brain and spinal cord    .
When used to lessen the chance leukemia cells will spread to the brain and spinal cord , it is called central nervous system ( CNS ) sanctuary therapy or CNS prophylaxis    .
See Drugs Approved for Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia for more information    .
Radiation therapy Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high - energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing    .
There are two types of radiation therapy : - External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer    .
- Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles , seeds , wires , or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer    .
The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type of cancer    .
External radiation therapy may be used to treat adult ALL that has spread , or may spread , to the brain and spinal cord    .
When used this way , it is called central nervous system ( CNS ) sanctuary therapy or CNS prophylaxis    .
External radiation therapy may also be used as palliative therapy to relieve symptoms and improve quality of life    .
Chemotherapy with stem cell transplant
Stem cell transplant is a method of giving chemotherapy and replacing blood - forming cells destroyed by the cancer treatment    .
Stem cells ( immature blood cells ) are removed from the blood or bone marrow of the patient or a donor and are frozen and stored    .
After the chemotherapy is completed , the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion    .
These reinfused stem cells grow into ( and restore ) the body 's blood cells    .
See Drugs Approved for Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia for more information    .
Targeted therapy Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells    .
Targeted therapy drugs called tyrosine kinase inhibitors are used to treat some types of adult ALL    .
These drugs block the enzyme , tyrosine kinase , that causes stem cells to develop into more white blood cells ( blasts ) than the body needs    .
Three of the drugs used are imatinib mesylate ( Gleevec ) , dasatinib , and nilotinib    .
See Drugs Approved for Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia for more information    .
New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials    .
This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials    .
It may not mention every new treatment being studied    .
Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website    .
Biologic therapy Biologic therapy is a treatment that uses the patient 's immune system to fight cancer    .
Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost , direct , or restore the body 's natural defenses against cancer    .
This type of cancer treatment is also called biotherapy or immunotherapy    .
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
For some patients , taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice    .
Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process    .
Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment    .
Many of today 's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials    .
Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment    .
Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future    .
Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments , they often answer important questions and help move research forward    .
Patients can enter clinical trials before , during , or after starting their cancer treatment    .
Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment    .
Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better    .
There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring ( coming back ) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment    .
Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country    .
See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials    .
These have been retrieved from NCI 's listing of clinical trials    .
Patients with ALL may have late effects after treatment    .
Side effects from cancer treatment that begin during or after treatment and continue for months or years are called late effects    .
Late effects of treatment for ALL may include the risk of second cancers ( new types of cancer )    .
Regular follow - up exams are very important for long - term survivors    .
Follow - up tests may be needed    .
Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated    .
Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working    .
Decisions about whether to continue , change , or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests    .
Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended    .
The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred ( come back )    .
These tests are sometimes called follow - up tests or check - ups    .

What is (are) Adult Acute Myeloid Leukemia ?

Key Points
- Adult acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) is a type of cancer in which the bone marrow makes abnormal myeloblasts ( a type of white blood cell ) , red blood cells , or platelets    .
- Leukemia may affect red blood cells , white blood cells , and platelets    .
- There are different subtypes of AML    .
- Smoking , previous chemotherapy treatment , and exposure to radiation may affect the risk of adult AML    .
- Signs and symptoms of adult AML include fever , feeling tired , and easy bruising or bleeding    .
- Tests that examine the blood and bone marrow are used to detect ( find ) and diagnose adult AML    .
- Certain factors affect prognosis ( chance of recovery ) and treatment options    .
Adult acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) is a type of cancer in which the bone marrow makes abnormal myeloblasts ( a type of white blood cell ) , red blood cells , or platelets    .
Adult acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) is a cancer of the blood and bone marrow    .
This type of cancer usually gets worse quickly if it is not treated    .
It is the most common type of acute leukemia in adults    .
AML is also called acute myelogenous leukemia , acute myeloblastic leukemia , acute granulocytic leukemia , and acute nonlymphocytic leukemia    .
Leukemia may affect red blood cells , white blood cells , and platelets    .
Normally , the bone marrow makes blood stem cells ( immature cells ) that become mature blood cells over time    .
A blood stem cell may become a myeloid stem cell or a lymphoid stem cell    .
A lymphoid stem cell becomes a white blood cell    .
A myeloid stem cell becomes one of three types of mature blood cells : - Red blood cells that carry oxygen and other substances to all tissues of the body    .
- White blood cells that fight infection and disease    .
- Platelets that form blood clots to stop bleeding    .
In AML , the myeloid stem cells usually become a type of immature white blood cell called myeloblasts ( or myeloid blasts )    .
The myeloblasts in AML are abnormal and do not become healthy white blood cells    .
Sometimes in AML , too many stem cells become abnormal red blood cells or platelets    .
These abnormal white blood cells , red blood cells , or platelets are also called leukemia cells or blasts    .
Leukemia cells can build up in the bone marrow and blood so there is less room for healthy white blood cells , red blood cells , and platelets    .
When this happens , infection , anemia , or easy bleeding may occur    .
The leukemia cells can spread outside the blood to other parts of the body , including the central nervous system ( brain and spinal cord ) , skin , and gums    .
This summary is about adult AML    .
See the following PDQ summaries for information about other types of leukemia : - Childhood Acute Myeloid Leukemia / Other Myeloid Malignancies Treatment - Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia Treatment - Adult Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Treatment - Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Treatment - Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Treatment - Hairy Cell Leukemia Treatment
There are different subtypes of AML    .
Most AML subtypes are based on how mature ( developed ) the cancer cells are at the time of diagnosis and how different they are from normal cells    .
Acute promyelocytic leukemia ( APL ) is a subtype of AML that occurs when parts of two genes stick together    .
APL usually occurs in middle - aged adults    .
Signs of APL may include both bleeding and forming blood clots    .
Who is at risk for Adult Acute Myeloid Leukemia? ?

Smoking , previous chemotherapy treatment , and exposure to radiation may affect the risk of adult AML    .
Anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor    .
Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer ; not having risk factors doesnt mean that you will not get cancer    .
Talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk    .
Possible risk factors for AML include the following : - Being male    .
- Smoking , especially after age 60    .    - Having had treatment with chemotherapy or radiation therapy in the past    .
- Having had treatment for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) in the past    .
- Being exposed to radiation from an atomic bomb or to the chemical benzene    .
- Having a history of a blood disorder such as myelodysplastic syndrome    .
What are the symptoms of Adult Acute Myeloid Leukemia ?

Signs and symptoms of adult AML include fever , feeling tired , and easy bruising or bleeding    .

The early signs and symptoms of AML may be like those caused by the flu or other common diseases    .
Check with your doctor if you have any of the following : - Fever    .    - Shortness of breath    .
- Easy bruising or bleeding    .
- Petechiae ( flat , pinpoint spots under the skin caused by bleeding )    .
- Weakness or feeling tired    .
- Weight loss or loss of appetite    .
How to diagnose Adult Acute Myeloid Leukemia ?

Tests that examine the blood and bone marrow are used to detect ( find ) and diagnose adult AML    .
The following tests and procedures may be used : - Physical exam and history :
An exam of the body to check general signs of health , including checking for signs of disease , such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual    .
A history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken    .
- Complete blood count ( CBC ) : A procedure in which a sample of blood is drawn and checked for the following : - The number of red blood cells , white blood cells , and platelets    .
- The amount of hemoglobin ( the protein that carries oxygen ) in the red blood cells    .
- The portion of the sample made up of red blood cells    .
- Peripheral blood smear :
A procedure in which a sample of blood is checked for blast cells , the number and kinds of white blood cells , the number of platelets , and changes in the shape of blood cells    .
- Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy :
The removal of bone marrow , blood , and a small piece of bone by inserting a hollow needle into the hipbone or breastbone    .
A pathologist views the bone marrow , blood , and bone under a microscope to look for signs of cancer    .
- Cytogenetic analysis :
A laboratory test in which the cells in a sample of blood or bone marrow are viewed under a microscope to look for certain changes in the chromosomes    .
Other tests , such as fluorescence in situ hybridization ( FISH ) , may also be done to look for certain changes in the chromosomes    .
- Immunophenotyping :
A process used to identify cells , based on the types of antigens or markers on the surface of the cell    .
This process is used to diagnose the subtype of AML by comparing the cancer cells to normal cells of the immune system    .
For example , a cytochemistry study may test the cells in a sample of tissue using chemicals ( dyes ) to look for certain changes in the sample    .
A chemical may cause a color change in one type of leukemia cell but not in another type of leukemia cell    .
- Reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction test ( RTPCR ) : A laboratory test in which cells in a sample of tissue are studied using chemicals to look for certain changes in the structure or function of genes    .
This test is used to diagnose certain types of AML including acute promyelocytic leukemia ( APL )    .
What is the outlook for Adult Acute Myeloid Leukemia ?

Certain factors affect prognosis ( chance of recovery ) and treatment options    .
The prognosis ( chance of recovery ) and treatment options depend on : - The age of the patient    .
- The subtype of AML    .    - Whether the patient received chemotherapy in the past to treat a different cancer    .
- Whether there is a history of a blood disorder such as myelodysplastic syndrome    .
- Whether the cancer has spread to the central nervous system    .
- Whether the cancer has been treated before or recurred ( come back )    .
It is important that acute leukemia be treated right away    .
What are the stages of Adult Acute Myeloid Leukemia ?

Key Points
- Once adult acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) has been diagnosed , tests are done to find out if the cancer has spread to other parts of the body    .
- There is no standard staging system for adult AML    .
Once adult acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) has been diagnosed , tests are done to find out if the cancer has spread to other parts of the body    .
The extent or spread of cancer is usually described as stages    .
In adult acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) , the subtype of AML and whether the leukemia has spread outside the blood and bone marrow are used instead of the stage to plan treatment    .
The following tests and procedures may be used to determine if the leukemia has spread : - Lumbar puncture :
A procedure used to collect a sample of cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) from the spinal column    .
This is done by placing a needle between two bones in the spine and into the CSF around the spinal cord and removing a sample of the fluid    .
The sample of CSF is checked under a microscope for signs that leukemia cells have spread to the brain and spinal cord    .
This procedure is also called an LP or spinal tap    .
- CT scan ( CAT scan ) : A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of the abdomen , taken from different angles    .
The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine    .
A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly    .
This procedure is also called computed tomography , computerized tomography , or computerized axial tomography    .
There is no standard staging system for adult AML    .
The disease is described as untreated , in remission , or recurrent    .
Untreated adult AML
In untreated adult AML , the disease is newly diagnosed    .
It has not been treated except to relieve signs and symptoms such as fever , bleeding , or pain , and the following are true : - The complete blood count is abnormal    .
- At least 20 % of the cells in the bone marrow are blasts ( leukemia cells )    .
- There are signs or symptoms of leukemia    .
Adult AML in remission
In adult AML in remission , the disease has been treated and the following are true : - The complete blood count is normal    .
- Less than 5 % of the cells in the bone marrow are blasts ( leukemia cells )    .    - There are no signs or symptoms of leukemia in the brain and spinal cord or elsewhere in the body    .
Recurrent Adult AML
Recurrent AML is cancer that has recurred ( come back ) after it has been treated    .
The AML may come back in the blood or bone marrow    .
What are the treatments for Adult Acute Myeloid Leukemia ?

Key Points
- There are different types of treatment for patients with adult acute myeloid leukemia    .
- The treatment of adult AML usually has 2 phases    .
- Four types of standard treatment are used : - Chemotherapy - Radiation therapy - Stem cell transplant - Other drug therapy - New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials    .
- Targeted therapy - Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
- Patients can enter clinical trials before , during , or after starting their cancer treatment    .
- Follow - up tests may be needed    .
There are different types of treatment for patients with adult acute myeloid leukemia    .
Different types of treatment are available for patients with adult acute myeloid leukemia ( AML )    .
Some treatments are standard ( the currently used treatment ) , and some are being tested in clinical trials    .
A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer    .
When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment , the new treatment may become the standard treatment    .
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment    .
The treatment of adult AML usually has 2 phases    .
The 2 treatment phases of adult AML are : - Remission induction therapy :
This is the first phase of treatment    .
The goal is to kill the leukemia cells in the blood and bone marrow    .
This puts the leukemia into remission    .
- Post - remission therapy :
This is the second phase of treatment    .
It begins after the leukemia is in remission    .
The goal of post - remission therapy is to kill any remaining leukemia cells that may not be active but could begin to regrow and cause a relapse    .
This phase is also called remission continuation therapy    .
Four types of standard treatment are used :
Chemotherapy Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells , either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing    .
When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle , the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body ( systemic chemotherapy )    .
When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid ( intrathecal chemotherapy ) , an organ , or a body cavity such as the abdomen , the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas ( regional chemotherapy )    .
Intrathecal chemotherapy may be used to treat adult AML that has spread to the brain and spinal cord    .
Combination chemotherapy is treatment using more than one anticancer drug    .
The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the subtype of AML being treated and whether leukemia cells have spread to the brain and spinal cord    .
See Drugs Approved for Acute Myeloid Leukemia for more information    .
Radiation therapy Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high - energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing    .
There are two types of radiation therapy : - External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer    .
- Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles , seeds , wires , or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer    .
The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type of cancer being treated and whether leukemia cells have spread to the brain and spinal cord    .
External radiation therapy is used to treat adult AML    .
Stem cell transplant
Stem cell transplant is a method of giving chemotherapy and replacing blood - forming cells that are abnormal or destroyed by the cancer treatment    .
Stem cells ( immature blood cells ) are removed from the blood or bone marrow of the patient or a donor and are frozen and stored    .
After the chemotherapy is completed , the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion    .
These reinfused stem cells grow into ( and restore ) the body 's blood cells    .
Other drug therapy Arsenic trioxide and all - trans retinoic acid ( ATRA ) are anticancer drugs that kill leukemia cells , stop the leukemia cells from dividing , or help the leukemia cells mature into white blood cells    .
These drugs are used in the treatment of a subtype of AML called acute promyelocytic leukemia    .
See Drugs Approved for Acute Myeloid Leukemia for more information    .
New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials    .
This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials    .
It may not mention every new treatment being studied    .
Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website    .
Targeted therapy Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells    .
Monoclonal antibody therapy is one type of targeted therapy being studied in the treatment of adult AML    .
Monoclonal antibody therapy is a cancer treatment that uses antibodies made in the laboratory from a single type of immune system cell    .
These antibodies can identify substances on cancer cells or normal substances that may help cancer cells grow    .
The antibodies attach to the substances and kill the cancer cells , block their growth , or keep them from spreading    .
Monoclonal antibodies are given by infusion    .
They may be used alone or to carry drugs , toxins , or radioactive material directly to cancer cells    .
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
For some patients , taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice    .
Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process    .
Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment    .
Many of today 's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials    .
Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment    .
Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future    .
Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments , they often answer important questions and help move research forward    .
Patients can enter clinical trials before , during , or after starting their cancer treatment    .
Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment    .
Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better    .
There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring ( coming back ) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment    .
Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country    .
See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials    .
These have been retrieved from NCI 's listing of clinical trials    .
Follow - up tests may be needed    .
Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated    .
Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working    .
Decisions about whether to continue , change , or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests    .
Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended    .
The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred ( come back )    .
These tests are sometimes called follow - up tests or check - ups    .

What is (are) Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia ?

Key Points
- Chronic lymphocytic leukemia is a type of cancer in which the bone marrow makes too many lymphocytes ( a type of white blood cell )    .
- Leukemia may affect red blood cells , white blood cells , and platelets    .
- Older age can affect the risk of developing chronic lymphocytic leukemia    .
- Signs and symptoms of chronic lymphocytic leukemia include swollen lymph nodes and tiredness    .
- Tests that examine the blood , bone marrow , and lymph nodes are used to detect ( find ) and diagnose chronic lymphocytic leukemia    .
- Certain factors affect treatment options and prognosis ( chance of recovery )    .
Chronic lymphocytic leukemia is a type of cancer in which the bone marrow makes too many lymphocytes ( a type of white blood cell )    .
Chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( also called CLL ) is a blood and bone marrow disease that usually gets worse slowly    .
CLL is one of the most common types of leukemia in adults    .
It often occurs during or after middle age ; it rarely occurs in children    .
Leukemia may affect red blood cells , white blood cells , and platelets    .
Normally , the body makes blood stem cells ( immature cells ) that become mature blood cells over time    .
A blood stem cell may become a myeloid stem cell or a lymphoid stem cell    .
A myeloid stem cell becomes one of three types of mature blood cells : - Red blood cells that carry oxygen and other substances to all tissues of the body    .
- White blood cells that fight infection and disease    .
- Platelets that form blood clots to stop bleeding    .
A lymphoid stem cell becomes a lymphoblast cell and then one of three types of lymphocytes ( white blood cells ) : - B lymphocytes that make antibodies to help fight infection    .
- T lymphocytes that help B lymphocytes make antibodies to fight infection    .
- Natural killer cells that attack cancer cells and viruses    .
In CLL , too many blood stem cells become abnormal lymphocytes and do not become healthy white blood cells    .
The abnormal lymphocytes may also be called leukemia cells    .
The lymphocytes are not able to fight infection very well    .
Also , as the number of lymphocytes increases in the blood and bone marrow , there is less room for healthy white blood cells , red blood cells , and platelets    .
This may cause infection , anemia , and easy bleeding    .
This summary is about chronic lymphocytic leukemia    .
See the following PDQ summaries for more information about leukemia : - Adult Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Treatment    .
- Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Treatment    .
- Adult Acute Myeloid Leukemia Treatment    .
- Childhood Acute Myeloid Leukemia / Other Myeloid Malignancies Treatment    .    - Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia Treatment    .
- Hairy Cell Leukemia Treatment    .
Who is at risk for Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia? ?

Older age can affect the risk of developing chronic lymphocytic leukemia    .
Anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor    .
Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer ; not having risk factors doesnt mean that you will not get cancer    .
Talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk    .
Risk factors for CLL include the following : - Being middle - aged or older , male , or white    .    - A family history of CLL or cancer of the lymph system    .
- Having relatives who are Russian Jews or Eastern European Jews    .
What are the symptoms of Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia ?

Signs and symptoms of chronic lymphocytic leukemia include swollen lymph nodes and tiredness    .
Usually CLL does not cause any signs or symptoms and is found during a routine blood test    .
Signs and symptoms may be caused by CLL or by other conditions    .
Check with your doctor if you have any of the following : - Painless swelling of the lymph nodes in the neck , underarm , stomach , or groin    .
- Feeling very tired    .
- Pain or fullness below the ribs    .
- Fever and infection    .
- Weight loss for no known reason    .
How to diagnose Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia ?

Tests that examine the blood , bone marrow , and lymph nodes are used to detect ( find ) and diagnose chronic lymphocytic leukemia    .
The following tests and procedures may be used : - Physical exam and history :
An exam of the body to check general signs of health , including checking for signs of disease , such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual    .
A history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken    .
- Complete blood count ( CBC ) with differential :
A procedure in which a sample of blood is drawn and checked for the following : - The number of red blood cells and platelets    .
- The number and type of white blood cells    .
- The amount of hemoglobin ( the protein that carries oxygen ) in the red blood cells    .
- The portion of the blood sample made up of red blood cells    .
- Immunophenotyping :
A laboratory test in which the antigens or markers on the surface of a blood or bone marrow cell are checked to see if they are lymphocytes or myeloid cells    .
If the cells are malignant lymphocytes ( cancer ) , they are checked to see if they are B lymphocytes or T lymphocytes    .
- FISH ( fluorescence in situ hybridization ) : A laboratory technique used to look at genes or chromosomes in cells and tissues    .
Pieces of DNA that contain a fluorescent dye are made in the laboratory and added to cells or tissues on a glass slide    .
When these pieces of DNA bind to specific genes or areas of chromosomes on the slide , they light up when viewed under a microscope with a special light    .
- Flow cytometry :
A laboratory test that measures the number of cells in a sample , the percentage of live cells in a sample , and certain characteristics of cells , such as size , shape , and the presence of tumor markers on the cell surface    .
The cells are stained with a light - sensitive dye , placed in a fluid , and passed in a stream before a laser or other type of light    .
The measurements are based on how the light - sensitive dye reacts to the light    .
- IgVH gene mutation test : A laboratory test done on a bone marrow or blood sample to check for an IgVH gene mutation    .
Patients with an IgVH gene mutation have a better prognosis    .
- Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy :
The removal of bone marrow , blood , and a small piece of bone by inserting a hollow needle into the hipbone or breastbone    .
A pathologist views the bone marrow , blood , and bone under a microscope to look for abnormal cells    .

what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia ?

New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials    .
This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials    .
It may not mention every new treatment being studied    .
Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website    .
Chemotherapy with stem cell transplant Chemotherapy with stem cell transplant is a method of giving chemotherapy and replacing blood - forming cells destroyed by the cancer treatment    .
Stem cells ( immature blood cells ) are removed from the blood or bone marrow of the patient or a donor and are frozen and stored    .
After the chemotherapy is completed , the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion    .
These reinfused stem cells grow into ( and restore ) the bodys blood cells    .
Biologic therapy Biologic therapy is a treatment that uses the patient 's immune system to fight cancer    .
Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost , direct , or restore the body 's natural defenses against cancer    .
This type of cancer treatment is also called biotherapy or immunotherapy    .
Chimeric antigen receptor ( CAR ) T - cell therapy CAR T - cell therapy is a type of immunotherapy that changes the patient 's T cells ( a type of immune system cell ) so they will attack certain proteins on the surface of cancer cells    .
T cells are taken from the patient and special receptors are added to their surface in the laboratory    .
The changed cells are called chimeric antigen receptor ( CAR ) T cells    .
The CAR T cells are grown in the laboratory and given to the patient by infusion    .
The CAR T cells multiply in the patient 's blood and attack cancer cells    .
CAR T - cell therapy is being studied in the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia    .
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
For some patients , taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice    .
Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process    .
Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment    .
Many of today 's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials    .
Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment    .
Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future    .
Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments , they often answer important questions and help move research forward    .
Patients can enter clinical trials before , during , or after starting their cancer treatment    .
Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment    .
Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better    .
There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring ( coming back ) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment    .
Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country    .

There are different types of treatment for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia    .
Different types of treatment are available for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia    .
Some treatments are standard ( the currently used treatment ) , and some are being tested in clinical trials    .
A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer    .
When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment , the new treatment may become the standard treatment    .
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment    .
Five types of standard treatment are used :
Watchful waiting Watchful waiting is closely monitoring a patients condition without giving any treatment until signs or symptoms appear or change    .
This is also called observation    .
During this time , problems caused by the disease , such as infection , are treated    .
Radiation therapy Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high - energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing    .
There are two types of radiation therapy : - External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer    .
- Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles , seeds , wires , or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer    .
The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type of cancer being treated    .
External radiation therapy is used to treat chronic lymphocytic leukemia    .
Chemotherapy Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells , either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing    .
When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle , the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body ( systemic chemotherapy )    .
When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid , an organ , or a body cavity such as the abdomen , or the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas ( regional chemotherapy )    .
The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated    .
See Drugs Approved for Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia for more information    .
Surgery Splenectomy is surgery to remove the spleen    .
Targeted therapy Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells    .
Monoclonal antibody therapy , tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy , and BCL2 inhibitor therapy are types of targeted therapy used in the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia    .
Monoclonal antibody therapy is a cancer treatment that uses antibodies made in the laboratory from a single type of immune system cell    .
These antibodies can identify substances on cancer cells or normal substances in the body that may help cancer cells grow    .
The antibodies attach to the substances and kill the cancer cells , block their growth , or keep them from spreading    .
Monoclonal antibodies are given by infusion    .
They may be used alone or to carry drugs , toxins , or radioactive material directly to cancer cells    .
Tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy is a cancer treatment that blocks signals needed for tumors to grow    .
BCL2 inhibitor therapy is a cancer treatment that blocks a protein called BCL2    .
BCL2 inhibitor therapy may kill cancer cells and may make them more sensitive to other anticancer drugs    .

What is (are) Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia ?

Key Points
- Chronic myelogenous leukemia is a disease in which the bone marrow makes too many white blood cells    .
- Leukemia may affect red blood cells , white blood cells , and platelets    .
- Signs and symptoms of chronic myelogenous leukemia include fever , night sweats , and tiredness    .
- Most people with CML have a gene mutation ( change ) called the Philadelphia chromosome    .
- Tests that examine the blood and bone marrow are used to detect ( find ) and diagnose chronic myelogenous leukemia    .
- Certain factors affect prognosis ( chance of recovery ) and treatment options    .
Chronic myelogenous leukemia is a disease in which the bone marrow makes too many white blood cells    .
Chronic myelogenous leukemia ( also called CML or chronic granulocytic leukemia ) is a slowly progressing blood and bone marrow disease that usually occurs during or after middle age , and rarely occurs in children    .
Leukemia may affect red blood cells , white blood cells , and platelets    .
Normally , the bone marrow makes blood stem cells ( immature cells ) that become mature blood cells over time    .
A blood stem cell may become a myeloid stem cell or a lymphoid stem cell    .
A lymphoid stem cell becomes a white blood cell    .
A myeloid stem cell becomes one of three types of mature blood cells : - Red blood cells that carry oxygen and other substances to all tissues of the body    .
- Platelets that form blood clots to stop bleeding    .
- Granulocytes ( white blood cells ) that fight infection and disease    .
In CML , too many blood stem cells become a type of white blood cell called granulocytes    .
These granulocytes are abnormal and do not become healthy white blood cells    .
They are also called leukemia cells    .
The leukemia cells can build up in the blood and bone marrow so there is less room for healthy white blood cells , red blood cells , and platelets    .
When this happens , infection , anemia , or easy bleeding may occur    .
This summary is about chronic myelogenous leukemia    .
See the following PDQ summaries for more information about leukemia : - Adult Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Treatment - Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Treatment - Adult Acute Myeloid Leukemia Treatment - Childhood Acute Myeloid Leukemia / Other Myeloid Malignancies Treatment - Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Treatment - Hairy Cell Leukemia Treatment
What are the symptoms of Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia ?

Signs and symptoms of chronic myelogenous leukemia include fever , night sweats , and tiredness    .
These and other signs and symptoms may be caused by CML or by other conditions    .
Check with your doctor if you have any of the following : - Feeling very tired    .
- Weight loss for no known reason    .
- Night sweats    .
- Fever    .    - Pain or a feeling of fullness below the ribs on the left side    .
Sometimes CML does not cause any symptoms at all    .
What are the genetic changes related to Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia ?

Most people with CML have a gene mutation ( change ) called the Philadelphia chromosome    .
Every cell in the body contains DNA ( genetic material ) that determines how the cell looks and acts    .
DNA is contained inside chromosomes    .
In CML , part of the DNA from one chromosome moves to another chromosome    .
This change is called the Philadelphia chromosome    .
It results in the bone marrow making an enzyme , called tyrosine kinase , that causes too many stem cells to become white blood cells ( granulocytes or blasts )    .
The Philadelphia chromosome is not passed from parent to child    .
How to diagnose Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia ?

Tests that examine the blood and bone marrow are used to detect ( find ) and diagnose chronic myelogenous leukemia    .      .
The following tests and procedures may be used : - Physical exam and history :
An exam of the body to check general signs of health , including checking for signs of disease such as an enlarged spleen    .
A history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken    .
- Complete blood count ( CBC ) with differential :
A procedure in which a sample of blood is drawn and checked for the following : - The number of red blood cells and platelets    .
- The number and type of white blood cells    .
- The amount of hemoglobin ( the protein that carries oxygen ) in the red blood cells    .
- The portion of the blood sample made up of red blood cells    .
- Blood chemistry studies :
A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body    .
An unusual ( higher or lower than normal ) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease    .
- Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy :
The removal of bone marrow , blood , and a small piece of bone by inserting a needle into the hipbone or breastbone    .
A pathologist views the bone marrow , blood , and bone under a microscope to look for abnormal cells    .
One of the following tests may be done on the samples of blood or bone marrow tissue that are removed : - Cytogenetic analysis :
A test in which cells in a sample of blood or bone marrow are viewed under a microscope to look for certain changes in the chromosomes , such as the Philadelphia chromosome    .
- FISH ( fluorescence in situ hybridization ) : A laboratory technique used to look at genes or chromosomes in cells and tissues    .
Pieces of DNA that contain a fluorescent dye are made in the laboratory and added to cells or tissues on a glass slide    .
When these pieces of DNA bind to specific genes or areas of chromosomes on the slide , they light up when viewed under a microscope with a special light    .
- Reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction ( RTPCR ) : A laboratory test in which cells in a sample of tissue are studied using chemicals to look for certain changes in the structure or function of genes    .
What is the outlook for Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia ?

Certain factors affect prognosis ( chance of recovery ) and treatment options    .
The prognosis ( chance of recovery ) and treatment options depend on the following : - The patients age    .
- The phase of CML    .    - The amount of blasts in the blood or bone marrow    .
- The size of the spleen at diagnosis    .
- The patients general health    .
What are the stages of Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia ?

Key Points
- After chronic myelogenous leukemia has been diagnosed , tests are done to find out if the cancer has spread    .
- Chronic myelogenous leukemia has 3 phases    .
- Chronic phase - Accelerated phase - Blastic phase
After chronic myelogenous leukemia has been diagnosed , tests are done to find out if the cancer has spread    .
Staging is the process used to find out how far the cancer has spread    .
There is no standard staging system for chronic myelogenous leukemia ( CML )    .
Instead , the disease is classified by phase : chronic phase , accelerated phase , or blastic phase    .
It is important to know the phase in order to plan treatment    .
The information from tests and procedures done to detect ( find ) and diagnose chronic myelogenous leukemia is also used to plan treatment    .
Chronic myelogenous leukemia has 3 phases    .
As the amount of blast cells increases in the blood and bone marrow , there is less room for healthy white blood cells , red blood cells , and platelets    .
This may result in infections , anemia , and easy bleeding , as well as bone pain and pain or a feeling of fullness below the ribs on the left side    .
The number of blast cells in the blood and bone marrow and the severity of signs or symptoms determine the phase of the disease    .
Chronic phase
In chronic phase CML , fewer than 10 % of the cells in the blood and bone marrow are blast cells    .
Accelerated phase
In accelerated phase CML , 10 % to 19 % of the cells in the blood and bone marrow are blast cells    .
Blastic phase
In blastic phase CML , 20 % or more of the cells in the blood or bone marrow are blast cells    .
When tiredness , fever , and an enlarged spleen occur during the blastic phase , it is called blast crisis    .
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia ?

New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials    .
Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website    .
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
For some patients , taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice    .
Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process    .
Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment    .
Many of today 's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials    .

What is (are) Hairy Cell Leukemia ?

Key Points
- Hairy cell leukemia is a type of cancer in which the bone marrow makes too many lymphocytes ( a type of white blood cell )    .
- Leukemia may affect red blood cells , white blood cells , and platelets    .
- Gender and age may affect the risk of hairy cell leukemia    .
- Signs and symptoms of hairy cell leukemia include infections , tiredness , and pain below the ribs    .
- Tests that examine the blood and bone marrow are used to detect ( find ) and diagnose hairy cell leukemia    .
- Certain factors affect treatment options and prognosis ( chance of recovery )    .
Hairy cell leukemia is a type of cancer in which the bone marrow makes too many lymphocytes ( a type of white blood cell )    .
Hairy cell leukemia is a cancer of the blood and bone marrow    .
This rare type of leukemia gets worse slowly or does not get worse at all    .
The disease is called hairy cell leukemia because the leukemia cells look &quot ; hairy&quot ; when viewed under a microscope    .
Leukemia may affect red blood cells , white blood cells , and platelets    .
Normally , the bone marrow makes blood stem cells ( immature cells ) that become mature blood cells over time    .
A blood stem cell may become a myeloid stem cell or a lymphoid stem cell    .
A myeloid stem cell becomes one of three types of mature blood cells : - Red blood cells that carry oxygen and other substances to all tissues of the body    .
- White blood cells that fight infection and disease    .
- Platelets that form blood clots to stop bleeding    .
A lymphoid stem cell becomes a lymphoblast cell and then into one of three types of lymphocytes ( white blood cells ) : - B lymphocytes that make antibodies to help fight infection    .
- T lymphocytes that help B lymphocytes make antibodies to help fight infection    .
- Natural killer cells that attack cancer cells and viruses    .
In hairy cell leukemia , too many blood stem cells become lymphocytes    .
These lymphocytes are abnormal and do not become healthy white blood cells    .
They are also called leukemia cells    .
The leukemia cells can build up in the blood and bone marrow so there is less room for healthy white blood cells , red blood cells , and platelets    .
This may cause infection , anemia , and easy bleeding    .
Some of the leukemia cells may collect in the spleen and cause it to swell    .
This summary is about hairy cell leukemia    .
See the following PDQ summaries for information about other types of leukemia : - Adult Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Treatment    .
- Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Treatment    .
- Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Treatment    .
- Adult Acute Myeloid Leukemia Treatment    .
- Childhood Acute Myeloid Leukemia / Other Myeloid Malignancies Treatment    .    - Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia Treatment    .
Who is at risk for Hairy Cell Leukemia? ?

Gender and age may affect the risk of hairy cell leukemia    .
Anything that increases your chance of getting a disease is called a risk factor    .
Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer ; not having risk factors doesnt mean that you will not get cancer    .
Talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk    .
The cause of hairy cell leukemia is unknown    .
It occurs more often in older men    .
What are the symptoms of Hairy Cell Leukemia ?

Signs and symptoms of hairy cell leukemia include infections , tiredness , and pain below the ribs    .
These and other signs and symptoms may be caused by hairy cell leukemia or by other conditions    .
Check with your doctor if you have any of the following : - Weakness or feeling tired    .
- Fever or frequent infections    .
- Easy bruising or bleeding    .
- Shortness of breath    .
- Weight loss for no known reason    .
- Pain or a feeling of fullness below the ribs    .
- Painless lumps in the neck , underarm , stomach , or groin    .
How to diagnose Hairy Cell Leukemia ?

Tests that examine the blood and bone marrow are used to detect ( find ) and diagnose hairy cell leukemia    .
The following tests and procedures may be used : - Physical exam and history :
An exam of the body to check general signs of health , including checking for signs of disease , such as a swollen spleen , lumps , or anything else that seems unusual    .
A history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken    .
- Complete blood count ( CBC ) : A procedure in which a sample of blood is drawn and checked for the following : - The number of red blood cells , white blood cells , and platelets    .
- The amount of hemoglobin ( the protein that carries oxygen ) in the red blood cells    .
- The portion of the sample made up of red blood cells    .
- Peripheral blood smear :
A procedure in which a sample of blood is checked for cells that look &quot ; hairy , &quot ; the number and kinds of white blood cells , the number of platelets , and changes in the shape of blood cells    .
- Blood chemistry studies :
A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body    .
An unusual ( higher or lower than normal ) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease    .
- Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy :
The removal of bone marrow , blood , and a small piece of bone by inserting a hollow needle into the hipbone or breastbone    .
A pathologist views the bone marrow , blood , and bone under a microscope to look for signs of cancer    .
- Immunophenotyping :
A laboratory test in which the antigens or markers on the surface of a blood or bone marrow cell are checked to see what type of cell it is    .
This test is done to diagnose the specific type of leukemia by comparing the cancer cells to normal cells of the immune system    .
- Flow cytometry :
A laboratory test that measures the number of cells in a sample , the percentage of live cells in a sample , and certain characteristics of cells , such as size , shape , and the presence of tumor markers on the cell surface    .
The cells are stained with a light - sensitive dye , placed in a fluid , and passed in a stream before a laser or other type of light    .
The measurements are based on how the light - sensitive dye reacts to the light    .
- Cytogenetic analysis :
A laboratory test in which cells in a sample of tissue are viewed under a microscope to look for certain changes in the chromosomes    .
- Gene mutation test : A laboratory test done on a bone marrow or blood sample to check for mutations in the BRAF gene    .
A BRAF gene mutation is often found in patients with hairy cell leukemia    .
- CT scan ( CAT scan ) : A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body , taken from different angles    .
The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine    .
A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly    .
This procedure is also called computed tomography , computerized tomography , or computerized axial tomography    .
A CT scan of the abdomen may be done to check for swollen lymph nodes or a swollen spleen    .
What is the outlook for Hairy Cell Leukemia ?

Certain factors affect treatment options and prognosis ( chance of recovery )    .
The treatment options may depend on the following : - The number of hairy ( leukemia ) cells and healthy blood cells in the blood and bone marrow    .
- Whether the spleen is swollen    .
- Whether there are signs or symptoms of leukemia , such as infection    .
- Whether the leukemia has recurred ( come back ) after previous treatment    .
The prognosis ( chance of recovery ) depends on the following : - Whether the hairy cell leukemia does not grow or grows so slowly it does not need treatment    .
- Whether the hairy cell leukemia responds to treatment    .
Treatment often results in a long - lasting remission ( a period during which some or all of the signs and symptoms of the leukemia are gone )    .
If the leukemia returns after it has been in remission , retreatment often causes another remission    .
What are the stages of Hairy Cell Leukemia ?

Key Points
- There is no standard staging system for hairy cell leukemia    .
There is no standard staging system for hairy cell leukemia    .
Staging is the process used to find out how far the cancer has spread    .
Groups are used in place of stages for hairy cell leukemia    .
The disease is grouped as untreated , progressive , or refractory    .
Untreated hairy cell leukemia
The hairy cell leukemia is newly diagnosed and has not been treated except to relieve signs or symptoms such as weight loss and infections    .
In untreated hairy cell leukemia , some or all of the following conditions occur : - Hairy ( leukemia ) cells are found in the blood and bone marrow    .
- The number of red blood cells , white blood cells , or platelets may be lower than normal    .
- The spleen may be larger than normal    .
Progressive hairy cell leukemia
In progressive hairy cell leukemia , the leukemia has been treated with either chemotherapy or splenectomy ( removal of the spleen ) and one or both of the following conditions occur : - There is an increase in the number of hairy cells in the blood or bone marrow    .

- The number of red blood cells , white blood cells , or platelets in the blood is lower than normal    .
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Hairy Cell Leukemia ?

New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials    .
Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website    .
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
For some patients , taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice    .
Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process    .
Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment    .
Many of today 's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials    .
Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment    .
Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future    .
Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments , they often answer important questions and help move research forward    .
Patients can enter clinical trials before , during , or after starting their cancer treatment    .
Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment    .
Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better    .
There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring ( coming back ) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment    .
Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country    .
See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials    .

What are the treatments for Hairy Cell Leukemia ?

Key Points
- There are different types of treatment for patients with hairy cell leukemia    .
- Five types of standard treatment are used : - Watchful waiting - Chemotherapy - Biologic therapy - Surgery - Targeted therapy - New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials    .
- Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
- Patients can enter clinical trials before , during , or after starting their cancer treatment    .
- Follow - up tests may be needed    .
There are different types of treatment for patients with hairy cell leukemia    .
Different types of treatment are available for patients with hairy cell leukemia    .
Some treatments are standard ( the currently used treatment ) , and some are being tested in clinical trials    .
A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer    .
When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment , the new treatment may become the standard treatment    .
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment    .
Five types of standard treatment are used :
Watchful waiting Watchful waiting is closely monitoring a patient 's condition , without giving any treatment until signs or symptoms appear or change    .
Chemotherapy Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells , either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing    .
When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle , the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body ( systemic chemotherapy )    .
When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid , an organ , or a body cavity such as the abdomen , the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas ( regional chemotherapy )    .
The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated    .
Cladribine and pentostatin are anticancer drugs commonly used to treat hairy cell leukemia    .
These drugs may increase the risk of other types of cancer , especially Hodgkin lymphoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma    .
Long - term follow up for second cancers is very important    .
Biologic therapy Biologic therapy is a cancer treatment that uses the patients immune system to fight cancer    .
Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost , direct , or restore the bodys natural defenses against cancer    .
This type of cancer treatment is also called biotherapy or immunotherapy    .
Interferon alfa is a biologic agent commonly used to treat hairy cell leukemia    .
See Drugs Approved for Hairy Cell Leukemia for more information    .
Surgery Splenectomy is a surgical procedure to remove the spleen    .
Targeted therapy Targeted therapy is a treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells    .
Monoclonal antibody therapy is a type of targeted therapy used to treat hairy cell leukemia    .
Monoclonal antibody therapy uses antibodies made in the laboratory from a single type of immune system cell    .
These antibodies can identify substances on cancer cells or normal substances that may help cancer cells grow    .
The antibodies attach to the substances and kill the cancer cells , block their growth , or keep them from spreading    .
Monoclonal antibodies are given by infusion    .
They may be used alone or to carry drugs , toxins , or radioactive material directly to cancer cells    .
A monoclonal antibody called rituximab may be used for certain patients with hairy cell leukemia    .
Other types of targeted therapies are being studied    .
New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials    .
Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website    .

See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials    .
These have been retrieved from NCI 's listing of clinical trials    .
Follow - up tests may be needed    .
Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated    .
Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working    .
Decisions about whether to continue , change , or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests    .
Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended    .
The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred ( come back )    .
These tests are sometimes called follow - up tests or check - ups    .

What is (are) Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia ?

Key Points
- Childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) is a type of cancer in which the bone marrow makes too many immature lymphocytes ( a type of white blood cell )    .
- Leukemia may affect red blood cells , white blood cells , and platelets    .
- Past treatment for cancer and certain genetic conditions affect the risk of having childhood ALL    .
- Signs of childhood ALL include fever and bruising    .
- Tests that examine the blood and bone marrow are used to detect ( find ) and diagnose childhood ALL    .
- Certain factors affect prognosis ( chance of recovery ) and treatment options    .
Childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) is a type of cancer in which the bone marrow makes too many immature lymphocytes ( a type of white blood cell )    .
Childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( also called ALL or acute lymphocytic leukemia ) is a cancer of the blood and bone marrow    .
This type of cancer usually gets worse quickly if it is not treated    .
ALL is the most common type of cancer in children    .
Leukemia may affect red blood cells , white blood cells , and platelets    .
In a healthy child , the bone marrow makes blood stem cells ( immature cells ) that become mature blood cells over time    .
A blood stem cell may become a myeloid stem cell or a lymphoid stem cell    .
A myeloid stem cell becomes one of three types of mature blood cells : - Red blood cells that carry oxygen and other substances to all tissues of the body    .
- Platelets that form blood clots to stop bleeding    .
- White blood cells that fight infection and disease    .
A lymphoid stem cell becomes a lymphoblast cell and then one of three types of lymphocytes ( white blood cells ) : - B lymphocytes that make antibodies to help fight infection    .
- T lymphocytes that help B lymphocytes make the antibodies that help fight infection    .
- Natural killer cells that attack cancer cells and viruses    .
In a child with ALL , too many stem cells become lymphoblasts , B lymphocytes , or T lymphocytes    .
The cells do not work like normal lymphocytes and are not able to fight infection very well    .
These cells are cancer ( leukemia ) cells    .
Also , as the number of leukemia cells increases in the blood and bone marrow , there is less room for healthy white blood cells , red blood cells , and platelets    .
This may lead to infection , anemia , and easy bleeding    .
This summary is about acute lymphoblastic leukemia in children , adolescents , and young adults    .
See the following PDQ summaries for information about other types of leukemia : - Childhood Acute Myeloid Leukemia / Other Myeloid Malignancies Treatment - Adult Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Treatment - Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Treatment - Adult Acute Myeloid Leukemia Treatment - Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia Treatment - Hairy Cell Leukemia Treatment
What are the symptoms of Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia ?

Signs of childhood ALL include fever and bruising    .
These and other signs and symptoms may be caused by childhood ALL or by other conditions    .
Check with your child 's doctor if your child has any of the following : - Fever    .    - Easy bruising or bleeding    .
- Petechiae ( flat , pinpoint , dark - red spots under the skin caused by bleeding )    .
- Bone or joint pain    .
- Painless lumps in the neck , underarm , stomach , or groin    .
- Pain or feeling of fullness below the ribs    .
- Weakness , feeling tired , or looking pale    .
- Loss of appetite    .
How to diagnose Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia ?

Tests that examine the blood and bone marrow are used to detect ( find ) and diagnose childhood ALL    .
The following tests and procedures may be used to diagnose childhood ALL and find out if leukemia cells have spread to other parts of the body such as the brain or testicles : - Physical exam and history :
An exam of the body to check general signs of health , including checking for signs of disease , such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual    .
A history of the patient 's health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken    .
- Complete blood count ( CBC ) with differential :
A procedure in which a sample of blood is drawn and checked for the following : - The number of red blood cells and platelets    .
- The number and type of white blood cells    .
- The amount of hemoglobin ( the protein that carries oxygen ) in the red blood cells    .
- The portion of the sample made up of red blood cells    .
- Blood chemistry studies :
A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body    .
An unusual ( higher or lower than normal ) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease    .
- Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy :
The removal of bone marrow and a small piece of bone by inserting a hollow needle into the hipbone or breastbone    .
A pathologist views the bone marrow and bone under a microscope to look for signs of cancer    .
The following tests are done on blood or the bone marrow tissue that is removed : - Cytogenetic analysis :
A laboratory test in which the cells in a sample of blood or bone marrow are viewed under a microscope to look for certain changes in the chromosomes of lymphocytes    .
For example , in Philadelphia chromosome positive ALL , part of one chromosome switches places with part of another chromosome    .
This is called the Philadelphia chromosome    .
- Immunophenotyping :
A laboratory test in which the antigens or markers on the surface of a blood or bone marrow cell are checked to see if they are lymphocytes or myeloid cells    .
If the cells are malignant lymphocytes ( cancer ) they are checked to see if they are B lymphocytes or T lymphocytes    .
- Lumbar puncture : A procedure used to collect a sample of cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) from the spinal column    .
This is done by placing a needle between two bones in the spine and into the CSF around the spinal cord and removing a sample of the fluid    .
The sample of CSF is checked under a microscope for signs that leukemia cells have spread to the brain and spinal cord    .
This procedure is also called an LP or spinal tap    .
This procedure is done after leukemia is diagnosed to find out if leukemia cells have spread to the brain and spinal cord    .
Intrathecal chemotherapy is given after the sample of fluid is removed to treat any leukemia cells that may have spread to the brain and spinal cord    .
- Chest x-ray :
An x-ray of the organs and bones inside the chest    .
An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film , making a picture of areas inside the body    .
The chest x-ray is done to see if leukemia cells have formed a mass in the middle of the chest    .
What is the outlook for Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia ?

Certain factors affect prognosis ( chance of recovery ) and treatment options    .
The prognosis ( chance of recovery ) depends on : - How quickly and how low the leukemia cell count drops after the first month of treatment    .
- Age at the time of diagnosis , gender , race , and ethnic background    .
- The number of white blood cells in the blood at the time of diagnosis    .
- Whether the leukemia cells began from B lymphocytes or T lymphocytes    .
- Whether there are certain changes in the chromosomes or genes of the lymphocytes with cancer    .
- Whether the child has Down syndrome    .
- Whether leukemia cells are found in the cerebrospinal fluid    .
- The child 's weight at the time of diagnosis and during treatment    .
Treatment options depend on : - Whether the leukemia cells began from B lymphocytes or T lymphocytes    .
- Whether the child has standard - risk , high - risk , or very highrisk ALL    .    - The age of the child at the time of diagnosis    .
- Whether there are certain changes in the chromosomes of lymphocytes , such as the Philadelphia chromosome    .
- Whether the child was treated with steroids before the start of induction therapy    .
- How quickly and how low the leukemia cell count drops during treatment    .
For leukemia that relapses ( comes back ) after treatment , the prognosis and treatment options depend partly on the following : - How long it is between the time of diagnosis and when the leukemia comes back    .
- Whether the leukemia comes back in the bone marrow or in other parts of the body    .
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia ?

New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials    .
This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials    .
It may not mention every new treatment being studied    .
Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website    .
Chimeric antigen receptor ( CAR ) T - cell therapy CAR T - cell therapy is a type of immunotherapy that changes the patient 's T cells ( a type of immune system cell ) so they will attack certain proteins on the surface of cancer cells    .
T cells are taken from the patient and special receptors are added to their surface in the laboratory    .
The changed cells are called chimeric antigen receptor ( CAR ) T cells    .
The CAR T cells are grown in the laboratory and given to the patient by infusion    .
The CAR T cells multiply in the patient 's blood and attack cancer cells    .
CAR T - cell therapy is being studied in the treatment of childhood ALL that has relapsed ( come back ) a second time    .
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
For some patients , taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice    .
Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process    .
Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment    .
Many of today 's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials    .
Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment    .

Who is at risk for Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia? ?

Key Points
Past treatment for cancer and certain genetic conditions affect the risk of having childhood ALL    .
Anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor    .
Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer ; not having risk factors doesnt mean that you will not get cancer    .
Talk with your child 's doctor if you think your child may be at risk    .
Possible risk factors for ALL include the following : - Being exposed to x-rays before birth    .
- Being exposed to radiation    .
- Past treatment with chemotherapy    .
- Having certain genetic conditions , such as : - Down syndrome    .
- Neurofibromatosis type 1    .    - Bloom syndrome    .
- Fanconi anemia    .    - Ataxia - telangiectasia    .
- Li-Fraumeni syndrome    .
- Constitutional mismatch repair deficiency ( mutations in certain genes that stop DNA from repairing itself , which leads to the growth of cancers at an early age )    .
- Having certain changes in the chromosomes or genes    .
Risk Groups
- In childhood ALL , risk groups are used to plan treatment    .
- Relapsed childhood ALL is cancer that has come back after it has been treated    .
In childhood ALL , risk groups are used to plan treatment    .
There are three risk groups in childhood ALL    .
They are described as : - Standard ( low ) risk : Includes children aged 1 to younger than 10 years who have a white blood cell count of less than 50,000 / L at the time of diagnosis    .
- High risk : Includes children 10 years and older and / or children who have a white blood cell count of 50,000 / L or more at the time of diagnosis    .
- Very high risk :
Includes children younger than age 1 , children with certain changes in the genes , children who have a slow response to initial treatment , and children who have signs of leukemia after the first 4 weeks of treatment    .
Other factors that affect the risk group include the following : - Whether the leukemia cells began from B lymphocytes or T lymphocytes    .
- Whether there are certain changes in the chromosomes or genes of the lymphocytes    .
- How quickly and how low the leukemia cell count drops after initial treatment    .
- Whether leukemia cells are found in the cerebrospinal fluid at the time of diagnosis    .
It is important to know the risk group in order to plan treatment    .
Children with high - risk or very highrisk ALL usually receive more anticancer drugs and / or higher doses of anticancer drugs than children with standard - risk ALL    .
Relapsed childhood ALL is cancer that has come back after it has been treated    .
The leukemia may come back in the blood and bone marrow , brain , spinal cord , testicles , or other parts of the body    .
Refractory childhood ALL is cancer that does not respond to treatment    .
What are the treatments for Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia ?

Key Points
- There are different types of treatment for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL )    .
- Children with ALL should have their treatment planned by a team of doctors who are experts in treating childhood leukemia    .
- Children and adolescents may have treatment - related side effects that appear months or years after treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia    .
- The treatment of childhood ALL usually has three phases    .
- Four types of standard treatment are used : - Chemotherapy - Radiation therapy - Chemotherapy with stem cell transplant - Targeted therapy - Treatment is given to kill leukemia cells that have spread or may spread to the brain , spinal cord , or testicles    .
- New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials    .
- Chimeric antigen receptor ( CAR ) T - cell therapy - Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
- Patients can enter clinical trials before , during , or after starting their cancer treatment    .
- Follow - up tests may be needed    .
There are different types of treatment for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL )    .
Different types of treatment are available for children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL )    .
Some treatments are standard ( the currently used treatment ) , and some are being tested in clinical trials    .
A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer    .
When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment , the new treatment may become the standard treatment    .
Because cancer in children is rare , taking part in a clinical trial should be considered    .
Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment    .
Children with ALL should have their treatment planned by a team of doctors who are experts in treating childhood leukemia    .
Treatment will be overseen by a pediatric oncologist , a doctor who specializes in treating children with cancer    .
The pediatric oncologist works with other pediatric health professionals who are experts in treating children with leukemia and who specialize in certain areas of medicine    .
These may include the following specialists : - Pediatrician    .    - Hematologist    .    - Medical oncologist    .
- Pediatric surgeon    .
- Radiation oncologist    .    - Neurologist    .    - Pathologist    .    - Radiologist    .
- Pediatric nurse specialist    .
- Social worker    .
- Rehabilitation specialist    .
- Psychologist    .
- Child - life specialist    .
Children and adolescents may have treatment - related side effects that appear months or years after treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia    .
Regular follow - up exams are very important    .
Treatment can cause side effects long after it has ended    .
These are called late effects    .
Late effects of cancer treatment may include : - Physical problems , including problems with the heart , blood vessels , liver , or bones , and fertility    .
When dexrazoxane is given with chemotherapy drugs called anthracyclines , the risk of late heart effects is lessened    .
- Changes in mood , feelings , thinking , learning , or memory    .
Children younger than 4 years who have received radiation therapy to the brain have a higher risk of these effects    .
- Second cancers ( new types of cancer ) or other conditions , such as brain tumors , thyroid cancer , acute myeloid leukemia , and myelodysplastic syndrome    .
Some late effects may be treated or controlled    .
It is important to talk with your child 's doctors about the possible late effects caused by some treatments    .
See the PDQ summary on Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer    .
The treatment of childhood ALL usually has three phases    .
The treatment of childhood ALL is done in phases : - Remission induction :
This is the first phase of treatment    .
The goal is to kill the leukemia cells in the blood and bone marrow    .
This puts the leukemia into remission    .
- Consolidation / intensification :
This is the second phase of treatment    .
It begins once the leukemia is in remission    .
The goal of consolidation / intensification therapy is to kill any leukemia cells that remain in the body and may cause a relapse    .
- Maintenance :
This is the third phase of treatment    .
The goal is to kill any remaining leukemia cells that may regrow and cause a relapse    .
Often the cancer treatments are given in lower doses than those used during the remission induction and consolidation / intensification phases    .
Not taking medication as ordered by the doctor during maintenance therapy increases the chance the cancer will come back    .
This is also called the continuation therapy phase    .
Four types of standard treatment are used :
Chemotherapy Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells , either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing    .
When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle , the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body ( systemic chemotherapy )    .
When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid ( intrathecal ) , an organ , or a body cavity such as the abdomen , the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas ( regional chemotherapy )    .
Combination chemotherapy is treatment using more than one anticancer drug    .
The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the child 's risk group    .
Children with high - risk ALL receive more anticancer drugs and higher doses of anticancer drugs than children with standard - risk ALL    .
Intrathecal chemotherapy may be used to treat childhood ALL that has spread , or may spread , to the brain and spinal cord    .
See Drugs Approved for Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia for more information    .
Radiation therapy Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high - energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing    .
There are two types of radiation therapy : - External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer    .
-कैंसर की ओर विकिरण भेजने के लिए एक्सटर्नल रेडिएशन थेरेपी में शरीर के बाहर एक मशीन का उपयोग किया जाता है।
- Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles , seeds , wires , or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer    .
The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type of cancer being treated    .
External radiation therapy may be used to treat childhood ALL that has spread , or may spread , to the brain , spinal cord , or testicles    .
It may also be used to prepare the bone marrow for a stem cell transplant    .
Chemotherapy with stem cell transplant
Stem cell transplant is a method of giving high doses of chemotherapy and sometimes total - body irradiation , and then replacing the blood - forming cells destroyed by the cancer treatment    .
Stem cells ( immature blood cells ) are removed from the blood or bone marrow of a donor    .
After the patient receives treatment , the donor 's stem cells are given to the patient through an infusion    .
These reinfused stem cells grow into ( and restore ) the patient 's blood cells    .
The stem cell donor does n't have to be related to the patient    .
Stem cell transplant is rarely used as initial treatment for children and adolescents with ALL    .
It is used more often as part of treatment for ALL that relapses ( comes back after treatment )    .
See Drugs Approved for Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia for more information    .
Targeted therapy Targeted therapy is a treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells    .
Tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( TKIs ) are targeted therapy drugs that block the enzyme , tyrosine kinase , which causes stem cells to become more white blood cells or blasts than the body needs    .
Imatinib mesylate is a TKI used in the treatment of children with Philadelphia chromosome positive ALL    .
Dasatinib and ruxolitinib are TKIs that are being studied in the treatment of newly diagnosed high - risk ALL    .
Monoclonal antibody therapy is a cancer treatment that uses antibodies made in the laboratory , from a single type of immune system cell    .
These antibodies can identify substances on cancer cells or normal substances that may help cancer cells grow    .
The antibodies attach to the substances and kill the cancer cells , block their growth , or keep them from spreading    .
Monoclonal antibodies are given by infusion    .
They may be used alone or to carry drugs , toxins , or radioactive material directly to cancer cells    .
Blinatumomab and inotuzumab are monoclonal antibodies being studied in the treatment of refractory childhood ALL    .
New kinds of targeted therapies are also being studied in the treatment of childhood ALL    .
See Drugs Approved for Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia for more information    .
Treatment is given to kill leukemia cells that have spread or may spread to the brain , spinal cord , or testicles    .
Treatment to kill leukemia cells or prevent the spread of leukemia cells to the brain and spinal cord ( central nervous system ; CNS ) is called CNS - directed therapy    .
Chemotherapy may be used to treat leukemia cells that have spread , or may spread , to the brain and spinal cord    .
Because standard doses of chemotherapy may not reach leukemia cells in the CNS , the cells are able to hide in the CNS    .
Systemic chemotherapy given in high doses or intrathecal chemotherapy ( into the cerebrospinal fluid ) is able to reach leukemia cells in the CNS    .
Sometimes external radiation therapy to the brain is also given    .
These treatments are given in addition to treatment that is used to kill leukemia cells in the rest of the body    .
All children with ALL receive CNS - directed therapy as part of induction therapy and consolidation / intensification therapy and sometimes during maintenance therapy    .
If the leukemia cells spread to the testicles , treatment includes high doses of systemic chemotherapy and sometimes radiation therapy    .
New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials    .
This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials    .
It may not mention every new treatment being studied    .
Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website    .
Chimeric antigen receptor ( CAR ) T - cell therapy CAR T - cell therapy is a type of immunotherapy that changes the patient 's T cells ( a type of immune system cell ) so they will attack certain proteins on the surface of cancer cells    .
T cells are taken from the patient and special receptors are added to their surface in the laboratory    .
The changed cells are called chimeric antigen receptor ( CAR ) T cells    .
The CAR T cells are grown in the laboratory and given to the patient by infusion    .
The CAR T cells multiply in the patient 's blood and attack cancer cells    .
CAR T - cell therapy is being studied in the treatment of childhood ALL that has relapsed ( come back ) a second time    .
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
For some patients , taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice    .
Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process    .
Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment    .
Many of today 's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials    .
Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment    .
Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future    .
Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments , they often answer important questions and help move research forward    .
Patients can enter clinical trials before , during , or after starting their cancer treatment    .
Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment    .
Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better    .
There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring ( coming back ) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment    .
Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country    .
See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials    .
These have been retrieved from NCI 's listing of clinical trials    .
Follow - up tests may be needed    .
Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated    .
Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working    .
Decisions about whether to continue , change , or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests    .
Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended    .
The results of these tests can show if your child 's condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred ( come back )    .
These tests are sometimes called follow - up tests or check - ups    .
Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy is done during all phases of treatment to see how well the treatment is working    .

What is (are) Childhood Acute Myeloid Leukemia and Other Myeloid Malignancies ?

Key Points
- Childhood acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) is a type of cancer in which the bone marrow makes a large number of abnormal blood cells    .
- Leukemia and other diseases of the blood and bone marrow may affect red blood cells , white blood cells , and platelets    .
- Other myeloid diseases can affect the blood and bone marrow    .
- Chronic myelogenous leukemia - Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia - Myelodysplastic syndromes - AML or MDS may occur after treatment with certain anticancer drugs and / or radiation therapy    .
- The risk factors for childhood AML , childhood CML , JMML , and MDS are similar    .
- Signs and symptoms of childhood AML , childhood CML , JMML , or MDS include fever , feeling tired , and easy bleeding or bruising    .
- Tests that examine the blood and bone marrow are used to detect ( find ) and diagnose childhood AML , childhood CML , JMML , and MDS    .
- Certain factors affect prognosis ( chance of recovery ) and treatment options    .
Childhood acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) is a type of cancer in which the bone marrow makes a large number of abnormal blood cells    .
Childhood acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) is a cancer of the blood and bone marrow    .
AML is also called acute myelogenous leukemia , acute myeloblastic leukemia , acute granulocytic leukemia , and acute nonlymphocytic leukemia    .
Cancers that are acute usually get worse quickly if they are not treated    .
Cancers that are chronic usually get worse slowly    .
Leukemia and other diseases of the blood and bone marrow may affect red blood cells , white blood cells , and platelets    .
Normally , the bone marrow makes blood stem cells ( immature cells ) that become mature blood cells over time    .
A blood stem cell may become a myeloid stem cell or a lymphoid stem cell    .
A lymphoid stem cell becomes a white blood cell    .
A myeloid stem cell becomes one of three types of mature blood cells : - Red blood cells that carry oxygen and other substances to all tissues of the body    .
- White blood cells that fight infection and disease    .
- Platelets that form blood clots to stop bleeding    .
In AML , the myeloid stem cells usually become a type of immature white blood cell called myeloblasts ( or myeloid blasts )    .
The myeloblasts , or leukemia cells , in AML are abnormal and do not become healthy white blood cells    .
The leukemia cells can build up in the blood and bone marrow so there is less room for healthy white blood cells , red blood cells , and platelets    .
When this happens , infection , anemia , or easy bleeding may occur    .
The leukemia cells can spread outside the blood to other parts of the body , including the central nervous system ( brain and spinal cord ) , skin , and gums    .
Sometimes leukemia cells form a solid tumor called a granulocytic sarcoma or chloroma    .
There are subtypes of AML based on the type of blood cell that is affected    .
The treatment of AML is different when it is a subtype called acute promyelocytic leukemia ( APL ) or when the child has Down syndrome    .
Other myeloid diseases can affect the blood and bone marrow    .
Chronic myelogenous leukemia
In chronic myelogenous leukemia ( CML ) , too many bone marrow stem cells become a type of white blood cell called granulocytes    .
Some of these bone marrow stem cells never become mature white blood cells    .
These are called blasts    .
Over time , the granulocytes and blasts crowd out the red blood cells and platelets in the bone marrow    .
CML is rare in children    .
Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia ( JMML ) is a rare childhood cancer that occurs more often in children around the age of 2 years and is more common in boys    .
In JMML , too many bone marrow stem cells become 2 types of white blood cells called myelocytes and monocytes    .
Some of these bone marrow stem cells never become mature white blood cells    .
These immature cells , called blasts , are unable to do their usual work    .
Over time , the myelocytes , monocytes , and blasts crowd out the red blood cells and platelets in the bone marrow    .
When this happens , infection , anemia , or easy bleeding may occur    .
Myelodysplastic syndromes Myelodysplastic syndromes ( MDS ) occur less often in children than in adults    .
In MDS , the bone marrow makes too few red blood cells , white blood cells , and platelets    .
These blood cells may not mature and enter the blood    .
The treatment for MDS depends on how low the numbers of red blood cells , white blood cells , or platelets are    .
Over time , MDS may become AML    .
Transient myeloproliferative disorder ( TMD ) is a type of MDS    .
This disorder of the bone marrow can develop in newborns who have Down syndrome    .
It usually goes away on its own within the first 3 weeks of life    .
Infants who have Down syndrome and TMD have an increased chance of developing AML before the age of 3 years    .
This summary is about childhood AML , childhood CML , JMML , and MDS    .
See the following PDQ summaries for more information about other types of leukemia and diseases of the blood and bone marrow in children and adults : - Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Treatment - Adult Acute Myeloid Leukemia Treatment - Adult Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Treatment - Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia Treatment - Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Treatment - Hairy Cell Leukemia Treatment - Myelodysplastic Syndromes Treatment - Myelodysplastic / Myeloproliferative Neoplasms Treatment
AML or MDS may occur after treatment with certain anticancer drugs and / or radiation therapy    .
Cancer treatment with certain anticancer drugs and / or radiation therapy may cause therapy - related AML ( t - AML ) or therapy - related MDS ( t - MDS )    .
The risk of these therapy - related myeloid diseases depends on the total dose of the anticancer drugs used and the radiation dose and treatment field    .
Some patients also have an inherited risk for t- AML and t- MDS    .
These therapy - related diseases usually occur within 7 years after treatment , but are rare in children    .
Who is at risk for Childhood Acute Myeloid Leukemia and Other Myeloid Malignancies? ?

The risk factors for childhood AML , childhood CML , JMML , and MDS are similar    .
Anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor    .
Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer ; not having risk factors doesnt mean that you will not get cancer    .
Talk with your childs doctor if you think your child may be at risk    .
These and other factors may increase the risk of childhood AML , childhood CML , JMML , and MDS : - Having a brother or sister , especially a twin , with leukemia    .
- Being Hispanic    .    - Being exposed to cigarette smoke or alcohol before birth    .
- Having a personal history of aplastic anemia    .
- Having a personal or family history of MDS    .
- Having a family history of AML    .
- Past treatment with chemotherapy or radiation therapy    .
- Being exposed to ionizing radiation or chemicals such as benzene    .
- Having certain genetic disorders , such as : - Down syndrome    .
- Fanconi anemia    .
- Neurofibromatosis type 1    .    - Noonan syndrome    .
- Shwachman - Diamond syndrome    .
What are the symptoms of Childhood Acute Myeloid Leukemia and Other Myeloid Malignancies ?

Signs and symptoms of childhood AML , childhood CML , JMML , or MDS include fever , feeling tired , and easy bleeding or bruising    .
These and other signs and symptoms may be caused by childhood AML , childhood CML , JMML , or MDS or by other conditions    .
Check with a doctor if your child has any of the following : - Fever with or without an infection    .
- Night sweats    .
- Shortness of breath    .
- Weakness or feeling tired    .
- Easy bruising or bleeding    .
- Petechiae ( flat , pinpoint spots under the skin caused by bleeding )    .
- Pain in the bones or joints    .
- Pain or feeling of fullness below the ribs    .
- Painless lumps in the neck , underarm , stomach , groin , or other parts of the body    .
In childhood AML , these lumps , called leukemia cutis , may be blue or purple    .
- Painless lumps that are sometimes around the eyes    .
These lumps , called chloromas , are sometimes seen in childhood AML and may be blue - green    .    - An eczema - like skin rash    .
The signs and symptoms of TMD may include the following : - Swelling all over the body    .
- Shortness of breath    .
- Trouble breathing    .
- Weakness or feeling tired    .
- Pain below the ribs    .
How to diagnose Childhood Acute Myeloid Leukemia and Other Myeloid Malignancies ?

Tests that examine the blood and bone marrow are used to detect ( find ) and diagnose childhood AML , childhood CML , JMML , and MDS    .
The following tests and procedures may be used : - Physical exam and history :
An exam of the body to check general signs of health , including checking for signs of disease , such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual    .
A history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken    .
- Complete blood count ( CBC ) with differential : A procedure in which a sample of blood is drawn and checked for the following : - The number of red blood cells and platelets    .
- The number and type of white blood cells    .
- The amount of hemoglobin ( the protein that carries oxygen ) in the red blood cells    .
- The portion of the blood sample made up of red blood cells    .
- Peripheral blood smear :
A procedure in which a sample of blood is checked for blast cells , the number and kinds of white blood cells , number of platelets , and changes in the shape of the blood cells    .
- Blood chemistry studies :
A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body    .
An unusual ( higher or lower than normal ) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease    .
- Chest x-ray :
An x-ray of the organs and bones inside the chest    .
An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film , making a picture of areas inside the body    .
- Biopsy :
The removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer    .
Biopsies that may be done include the following : - Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy :
The removal of bone marrow , blood , and a small piece of bone by inserting a hollow needle into the hipbone or breastbone    .
- Tumor biopsy : A biopsy of a chloroma may be done    .
- Lymph node biopsy :
The removal of all or part of a lymph node    .
- Cytogenetic analysis :
A laboratory test in which cells in a sample of blood or bone marrow are viewed under a microscope to look for certain changes in the chromosomes    .
Changes in the chromosomes may include when part of one chromosome is switched with part of another chromosome , part of one chromosome is missing or repeated , or part of one chromosome is turned upside down    .
The following test is a type of cytogenetic analysis : - FISH ( fluorescence in situ hybridization ) : A laboratory technique used to look at genes or chromosomes in cells and tissues    .
Pieces of DNA that contain a fluorescent dye are made in the laboratory and added to cells or tissues on a glass slide    .
When these pieces of DNA bind to specific genes or areas of chromosomes on the slide , they light up when viewed under a microscope with a special light    .
- Reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction ( RTPCR ) test : A laboratory test in which cells in a sample of tissue are studied using chemicals to look for certain changes in the structure or function of genes    .
- Immunophenotyping :
A process used to identify cells , based on the types of antigens or markers on the surface of the cell , that may include special staining of the blood and bone marrow cells    .
This process is used to diagnose the subtype of AML by comparing the cancer cells to normal cells of the immune system    .
- Molecular testing : A laboratory test to check for certain genes , proteins , or other molecules in a sample of blood or bone marrow    .
Molecular tests also check for certain changes in a gene or chromosome that may cause or affect the chance of developing AML    .
A molecular test may be used to help plan treatment , find out how well treatment is working , or make a prognosis    .
- Lumbar puncture : A procedure used to collect a sample of cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) from the spinal column    .
This is done by placing a needle between two bones in the spine and into the CSF around the spinal cord and removing a sample of the fluid    .
The sample of CSF is checked under a microscope for signs that leukemia cells have spread to the brain and spinal cord    .
This procedure is also called an LP or spinal tap    .
What is the outlook for Childhood Acute Myeloid Leukemia and Other Myeloid Malignancies ?

Certain factors affect prognosis ( chance of recovery ) and treatment options    .
The prognosis ( chance of recovery ) and treatment options for childhood AML depend on the following : - The age of the child when the cancer is diagnosed    .
- The race or ethnic group of the child    .
- Whether the child is greatly overweight    .
- Number of white blood cells in the blood at diagnosis    .
- Whether the AML occurred after previous cancer treatment    .
- The subtype of AML    .    - Whether there are certain chromosome or gene changes in the leukemia cells    .
- Whether the child has Down syndrome    .
Most children with AML and Down syndrome can be cured of their leukemia    .
- Whether the leukemia is in the central nervous system ( brain and spinal cord )    .
- How quickly the leukemia responds to treatment    .
- Whether the AML is newly diagnosed ( untreated ) or has recurred ( come back ) after being treated    .
- The length of time since treatment ended , for AML that has recurred    .
The prognosis and treatment options for childhood CML depend on how long it has been since the patient was diagnosed and how many blast cells are in the blood    .
The prognosis ( chance of recovery ) and treatment options for JMML depend on the following : - The age of the child when the cancer is diagnosed    .
- The type of gene affected and the number of genes that have changes    .
- How many red blood cells , white blood cells , or platelets are in the blood    .
- Whether the JMML is newly diagnosed ( untreated ) or has recurred after treatment    .
The prognosis ( chance of recovery ) and treatment options for MDS depend on the following : - Whether the MDS was caused by previous cancer treatment    .
- How low the numbers of red blood cells , white blood cells , or platelets are    .
- Whether the MDS is newly diagnosed ( untreated ) or has recurred after treatment    .
What are the stages of Childhood Acute Myeloid Leukemia and Other Myeloid Malignancies ?

Key Points
- Once childhood acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) has been diagnosed , tests are done to find out if the cancer has spread to other parts of the body    .
- There is no standard staging system for childhood AML , childhood chronic myelogenous leukemia ( CML ) , juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia ( JMML ) , or myelodysplastic syndromes ( MDS )    .
Once childhood acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) has been diagnosed , tests are done to find out if the cancer has spread to other parts of the body    .
The following tests and procedures may be used to determine if the leukemia has spread : - Lumbar puncture :
A procedure used to collect a sample of cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) from the spinal column    .
This is done by placing a needle between two bones in the spine and into the CSF around the spinal cord and removing a sample of the fluid    .
The sample of CSF is checked under a microscope for signs that leukemia cells have spread to the brain and spinal cord    .
This procedure is also called an LP or spinal tap    .
- Biopsy of the testicles , ovaries , or skin :
The removal of cells or tissues from the testicles , ovaries , or skin so they can be viewed under a microscope to check for signs of cancer    .
This is done only if something unusual about the testicles , ovaries , or skin is found during the physical exam    .
There is no standard staging system for childhood AML , childhood chronic myelogenous leukemia ( CML ) , juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia ( JMML ) , or myelodysplastic syndromes ( MDS )    .
The extent or spread of cancer is usually described as stages    .
Instead of stages , treatment of childhood AML , childhood CML , JMML , and MDS is based on one or more of the following : - The type of disease or the subtype of AML    .
- Whether leukemia has spread outside the blood and bone marrow    .
- Whether the disease is newly diagnosed , in remission , or recurrent    .
Newly diagnosed childhood AML Newly diagnosed childhood AML has not been treated except to relieve signs and symptoms such as fever , bleeding , or pain , and one of the following is true : - More than 20 % of the cells in the bone marrow are blasts ( leukemia cells )    .
or - Less than 20 % of the cells in the bone marrow are blasts and there is a specific change in the chromosome    .
Childhood AML in remission
In childhood AML in remission , the disease has been treated and the following are true : - The complete blood count is almost normal    .
- Less than 5 % of the cells in the bone marrow are blasts ( leukemia cells )    .    - There are no signs or symptoms of leukemia in the brain , spinal cord , or other parts of the body    .
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Childhood Acute Myeloid Leukemia and Other Myeloid Malignancies ?

New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials    .
This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials    .
It may not mention every new treatment being studied    .
Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website    .
Biologic therapy Biologic therapy is a treatment that uses the patients immune system to fight cancer    .
Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost , direct , or restore the bodys natural defenses against cancer    .
This type of cancer treatment is also called biotherapy or immunotherapy    .
Natural killer ( NK ) cells are a type of biologic therapy    .
NK cells are white blood cells that can kill tumor cells    .
These may be taken from a donor and given to the patient by infusion to help kill leukemia cells    .
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
For some patients , taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice    .
Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process    .
Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment    .
Many of today 's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials    .
Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment    .
Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future    .
Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments , they often answer important questions and help move research forward    .
Patients can enter clinical trials before , during , or after starting their cancer treatment    .
Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment    .
Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better    .
There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring ( coming back ) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment    .
Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country    .
See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials    .
These have been retrieved from NCI 's listing of clinical trials    .
What are the treatments for Childhood Acute Myeloid Leukemia and Other Myeloid Malignancies ?

Key Points
- There are different types of treatment for children with acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) , chronic myelogenous leukemia ( CML ) , juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia ( JMML ) , or myelodysplastic syndromes ( MDS )    .
- Treatment is planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating childhood leukemia and other diseases of the blood    .
- Some cancer treatments cause side effects months or years after treatment has ended    .
- The treatment of childhood AML usually has two phases    .
- Seven types of standard treatment are used for childhood AML , childhood CML , JMML , or MDS    .
- Chemotherapy - Radiation therapy - Stem cell transplant - Targeted therapy - Other drug therapy - Watchful waiting - Supportive care - New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials    .
- Biologic therapy - Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
- Patients can enter clinical trials before , during , or after starting their cancer treatment    .
- Follow - up tests may be needed    .
There are different types of treatment for children with acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) , chronic myelogenous leukemia ( CML ) , juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia ( JMML ) , or myelodysplastic syndromes ( MDS )    .
Different types of treatment are available for children with AML , CML , JMML , or MDS    .
Some treatments are standard ( the currently used treatment ) , and some are being tested in clinical trials    .
A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer    .
When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment , the new treatment may become the standard treatment    .
Because cancer in children is rare , taking part in a clinical trial should be considered    .
Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment    .
Treatment is planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating childhood leukemia and other diseases of the blood    .
Treatment will be overseen by a pediatric oncologist , a doctor who specializes in treating children with cancer    .
The pediatric oncologist works with other healthcare providers who are experts in treating children with leukemia and who specialize in certain areas of medicine    .
These may include the following specialists : - Pediatrician    .    - Hematologist    .    - Medical oncologist    .
- Pediatric surgeon    .
- Radiation oncologist    .
- Neurologist    .    - Neuropathologist    .
- Neuroradiologist    .
- Pediatric nurse specialist    .
- Social worker    .
- Rehabilitation specialist    .
- Psychologist    .
Some cancer treatments cause side effects months or years after treatment has ended    .
Regular follow - up exams are very important    .
Some cancer treatments cause side effects that continue or appear months or years after cancer treatment has ended    .
These are called late effects    .
Late effects of cancer treatment may include : - Physical problems    .
- Changes in mood , feelings , thinking , learning , or memory    .
- Second cancers ( new types of cancer )    .
Some late effects may be treated or controlled    .
It is important that parents of children who are treated for AML or other blood diseases talk with their doctors about the effects cancer treatment can have on their child    .
( See the PDQ summary on Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer for more information )    .
The treatment of childhood AML usually has two phases    .
The treatment of childhood AML is done in phases : - Induction therapy :
This is the first phase of treatment    .
The goal is to kill the leukemia cells in the blood and bone marrow    .
This puts the leukemia into remission    .
- Consolidation / intensification therapy :
This is the second phase of treatment    .
It begins once the leukemia is in remission    .
The goal of therapy is to kill any remaining leukemia cells that may not be active but could begin to regrow and cause a relapse    .
Treatment called central nervous system ( CNS ) sanctuary therapy may be given during the induction phase of therapy    .
Because standard doses of chemotherapy may not reach leukemia cells in the CNS ( brain and spinal cord ) , the cells are able to find sanctuary ( hide ) in the CNS    .
Intrathecal chemotherapy is able to reach leukemia cells in the CNS    .
It is given to kill the leukemia cells and lessen the chance the leukemia will recur ( come back )    .
CNS sanctuary therapy is also called CNS prophylaxis    .
Seven types of standard treatment are used for childhood AML , childhood CML , JMML , or MDS    .
Chemotherapy Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells , either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing    .
When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle , the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body ( systemic chemotherapy )    .
When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid ( intrathecal chemotherapy ) , an organ , or a body cavity such as the abdomen , the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas ( regional chemotherapy )    .
Combination chemotherapy is treatment using more than one anticancer drug    .
The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type of cancer being treated    .
In AML , the leukemia cells may spread to the brain and / or spinal cord    .
Chemotherapy given by mouth or vein to treat AML may not cross the blood - brain barrier to get into the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord    .
Instead , chemotherapy is injected into the fluid - filled space to kill leukemia cells that may have spread there ( intrathecal chemotherapy )    .
See Drugs Approved for Acute Myeloid Leukemia for more information    .
Radiation therapy Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high - energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing    .
There are two types of radiation therapy : - External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer    .
- Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles , seeds , wires , or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer    .
The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type of the cancer being treated    .
In childhood AML , external radiation therapy may be used to treat a chloroma that does not respond to chemotherapy    .
Stem cell transplant
Stem cell transplant is a way of giving chemotherapy and replacing blood - forming cells that are abnormal or destroyed by the cancer treatment    .
Stem cells ( immature blood cells ) are removed from the blood or bone marrow of the patient or a donor and are frozen and stored    .
After the chemotherapy is completed , the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion    .
These reinfused stem cells grow into ( and restore ) the body 's blood cells    .
Targeted therapy Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells    .
Types of targeted therapy include the following : - Tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy : Tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKI ) therapy blocks signals needed for tumors to grow    .
TKIs block the enzyme ( tyrosine kinase ) that causes stem cells to become more white blood cells ( granulocytes or blasts ) than the body needs    .
TKIs may be used with other anticancer drugs as adjuvant therapy ( treatment given after the initial treatment , to lower the risk that the cancer will come back )    .
- Imatinib is a type of TKI that is approved to treat childhood CML    .
- Sorafenib , dasatinib , and nilotinib are being studied in the treatment of childhood leukemia    .
- Monoclonal antibody therapy : Monoclonal antibody therapy uses antibodies made in the laboratory , from a single type of immune system cell    .
These antibodies can identify substances on cancer cells or normal substances that may help cancer cells grow    .
The antibodies attach to the substances and kill the cancer cells , block their growth , or keep them from spreading    .
Monoclonal antibodies are given by infusion    .
They may be used alone or to carry drugs , toxins , or radioactive material directly to cancer cells    .
- Gemtuzumab is a type of monoclonal antibody used in the treatment of a subtype of AML called acute promyelocytic leukemia ( APL )    .
Gemtuzumab is not available in the United States unless special approval is given    .
Monoclonal antibodies may be used with chemotherapy as adjuvant therapy    .
- Proteasome inhibitor therapy : Proteasome inhibitors break down proteins in cancer cells and kill them    .
- Bortezomib is a proteasome inhibitor used to treat childhood APL    .
See Drugs Approved for Leukemia for more information    .
Other drug therapy Lenalidomide may be used to lessen the need for transfusions in patients who have myelodysplastic syndromes caused by a specific chromosome change    .
Arsenic trioxide and all - trans retinoic acid ( ATRA ) are anticancer drugs that kill leukemia cells , stop the leukemia cells from dividing , or help the leukemia cells mature into white blood cells    .
These drugs are used in the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia    .
See Drugs Approved for Acute Myeloid Leukemia for more information    .
Watchful waiting Watchful waiting is closely monitoring a patients condition without giving any treatment until signs or symptoms appear or change    .
It is sometimes used to treat MDS or TMD    .
Supportive care Supportive care is given to lessen the problems caused by the disease or its treatment    .
Supportive care may include the following : - Transfusion therapy : A way of giving red blood cells , white blood cells , or platelets to replace blood cells destroyed by disease or cancer treatment    .
The blood may be donated from another person or it may have been taken from the patient earlier and stored until needed    .
- Drug therapy , such as antibiotics or antifungal agents    .
- Leukapheresis :
A procedure in which a special machine is used to remove white blood cells from the blood    .
Blood is taken from the patient and put through a blood cell separator where the white blood cells are removed    .
The rest of the blood is then returned to the patient 's bloodstream    .
New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials    .

Follow - up tests may be needed    .
Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated    .
Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working    .
Decisions about whether to continue , change , or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests    .
Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended    .
The results of these tests can show if your child 's condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred ( come back )    .
These tests are sometimes called follow - up tests or check - ups    .

What is (are) Adult Soft Tissue Sarcoma ?

Key Points
- Adult soft tissue sarcoma is a disease in which malignant ( cancer ) cells form in the soft tissues of the body    .
- Having certain inherited disorders can increase the risk of adult soft tissue sarcoma    .    - A sign of adult soft tissue sarcoma is a lump or swelling in soft tissue of the body    .
- Adult soft tissue sarcoma is diagnosed with a biopsy    .
- Certain factors affect treatment options and prognosis ( chance of recovery )    .
Adult soft tissue sarcoma is a disease in which malignant ( cancer ) cells form in the soft tissues of the body    .
The soft tissues of the body include the muscles , tendons ( bands of fiber that connect muscles to bones ) , fat , blood vessels , lymph vessels , nerves , and tissues around joints    .
Adult soft tissue sarcomas can form almost anywhere in the body , but are most common in the head , neck , arms , legs , trunk , and abdomen    .
There are many types of soft tissue sarcoma    .
The cells of each type of sarcoma look different under a microscope , based on the type of soft tissue in which the cancer began    .
See the following PDQ summaries for more information on soft tissue sarcomas : - Childhood Soft Tissue Sarcoma Treatment - Ewing Sarcoma Family of Tumors Treatment - Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors Treatment - Kaposi Sarcoma Treatment - Uterine Sarcoma Treatment
Who is at risk for Adult Soft Tissue Sarcoma? ?

Having certain inherited disorders can increase the risk of adult soft tissue sarcoma    .
Anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor    .
Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer ; not having risk factors does n't mean that you will not get cancer    .
Talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk    .
Risk factors for soft tissue sarcoma include the following inherited disorders : - Retinoblastoma    .    - Neurofibromatosis type 1 ( NF1 ; von Recklinghausen disease )    .
- Tuberous sclerosis ( Bourneville disease )    .
- Familial adenomatous polyposis ( FAP ; Gardner syndrome )    .
- Li-Fraumeni syndrome    .    - Werner syndrome ( adult progeria )    .
- Nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome ( Gorlin syndrome )    .
Other risk factors for soft tissue sarcoma include the following : - Past treatment with radiation therapy for certain cancers    .
- Being exposed to certain chemicals , such as Thorotrast ( thorium dioxide ) , vinyl chloride , or arsenic    .
- Having swelling ( lymphedema ) in the arms or legs for a long time    .
What are the symptoms of Adult Soft Tissue Sarcoma ?

A sign of adult soft tissue sarcoma is a lump or swelling in soft tissue of the body    .
A sarcoma may appear as a painless lump under the skin , often on an arm or a leg    .
Sarcomas that begin in the abdomen may not cause signs or symptoms until they get very big    .
As the sarcoma grows bigger and presses on nearby organs , nerves , muscles , or blood vessels , signs and symptoms may include : - Pain    .    - Trouble breathing    .
Other conditions may cause the same signs and symptoms    .
Check with your doctor if you have any of these problems    .
How to diagnose Adult Soft Tissue Sarcoma ?

Adult soft tissue sarcoma is diagnosed with a biopsy    .
If your doctor thinks you may have a soft tissue sarcoma , a biopsy will be done    .
The type of biopsy will be based on the size of the tumor and where it is in the body    .
There are three types of biopsy that may be used : - Incisional biopsy :
The removal of part of a lump or a sample of tissue    .
- Core biopsy :
The removal of tissue using a wide needle    .
- Excisional biopsy :
The removal of an entire lump or area of tissue that doesnt look normal    .
Samples will be taken from the primary tumor , lymph nodes , and other suspicious areas    .
A pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells and to find out the grade of the tumor    .
The grade of a tumor depends on how abnormal the cancer cells look under a microscope and how quickly the cells are dividing    .
High - grade tumors usually grow and spread more quickly than low - grade tumors    .
Because soft tissue sarcoma can be hard to diagnose , patients should ask to have tissue samples checked by a pathologist who has experience in diagnosing soft tissue sarcoma    .
The following tests may be done on the tissue that was removed : - Immunohistochemistry :
A test that uses antibodies to check for certain antigens in a sample of tissue    .
The antibody is usually linked to a radioactive substance or a dye that causes the tissue to light up under a microscope    .
This type of test may be used to tell the difference between different types of cancer    .
- Light and electron microscopy :
A laboratory test in which cells in a sample of tissue are viewed under regular and high - powered microscopes to look for certain changes in the cells    .
- Cytogenetic analysis :
A laboratory test in which cells in a sample of tissue are viewed under a microscope to look for certain changes in the chromosomes    .
- FISH ( fluorescence in situ hybridization ) : A laboratory test used to look at genes or chromosomes in cells and tissues    .
Pieces of DNA that contain a fluorescent dye are made in the laboratory and added to cells or tissues on a glass slide    .
When these pieces of DNA attach to certain genes or areas of chromosomes on the slide , they light up when viewed under a microscope with a special light    .
- Flow cytometry :
A laboratory test that measures the number of cells in a sample , the percentage of live cells in a sample , and certain characteristics of cells , such as size , shape , and the presence of tumor markers on the cell surface    .
The cells are stained with a light - sensitive dye , placed in a fluid , and passed in a stream before a laser or other type of light    .
The measurements are based on how the light - sensitive dye reacts to the light    .
What is the outlook for Adult Soft Tissue Sarcoma ?

Certain factors affect treatment options and prognosis ( chance of recovery )    .
The treatment options and prognosis ( chance of recovery ) depend on the following : - The type of soft tissue sarcoma    .    - The size , grade , and stage of the tumor    .
- How fast the cancer cells are growing and dividing    .
- Where the tumor is in the body    .
- Whether all of the tumor is removed by surgery    .
- The patient 's age and general health    .
- Whether the cancer has recurred ( come back )    .
What are the stages of Adult Soft Tissue Sarcoma ?

Key Points
- After adult soft tissue sarcoma has been diagnosed , tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the soft tissue or to other parts of the body    .
- There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body    .
- Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body    .
- The following stages are used for adult soft tissue sarcoma : - Stage I - Stage II - Stage III - Stage IV
After adult soft tissue sarcoma has been diagnosed , tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the soft tissue or to other parts of the body    .
The process used to find out if cancer has spread within the soft tissue or to other parts of the body is called staging    .
Staging of soft tissue sarcoma is also based on the grade and size of the tumor , whether it is superficial ( close to the skin 's surface ) or deep , and whether it has spread to the lymph nodes or other parts of the body    .
The information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease    .
It is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment    .
The following tests and procedures may be used in the staging process : - Physical exam and history :
An exam of the body to check general signs of health , including checking for signs of disease , such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual    .
A history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken    .
- Chest x-ray :
An x-ray of the organs and bones inside the chest    .
An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film , making a picture of areas inside the body    .
- Blood chemistry studies :
A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body    .
An unusual ( higher or lower than normal ) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease    .
- Complete blood count ( CBC ) : A procedure in which a sample of blood is drawn and checked for the following : - The number of red blood cells , white blood cells , and platelets    .
- The amount of hemoglobin ( the protein that carries oxygen ) in the red blood cells    .
- The portion of the blood sample made up of red blood cells    .
- CT scan ( CAT scan ) : A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside of the body , such as the lung and abdomen , taken from different angles    .
The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine    .
A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly    .
This procedure is also called computed tomography , computerized tomography , or computerized axial tomography    .
- MRI ( magnetic resonance imaging ) : A procedure that uses a magnet , radio waves , and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body    .
This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging ( NMRI )    .
- PET scan ( positron emission tomography scan ) : A procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body    .
A small amount of radioactive glucose ( sugar ) is injected into a vein    .
The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body    .
Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do    .
The results of these tests are viewed together with the results of the tumor biopsy to find out the stage of the soft tissue sarcoma before treatment is given    .
Sometimes chemotherapy or radiation therapy is given as the initial treatment and afterwards the soft tissue sarcoma is staged again    .
There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body    .
Cancer can spread through tissue , the lymph system , and the blood : - Tissue    .
The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas    .
- Lymph system    .
The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system    .
The cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body    .
- Blood    .
The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood    .
The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body    .
Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body    .
When cancer spreads to another part of the body , it is called metastasis    .
Cancer cells break away from where they began ( the primary tumor ) and travel through the lymph system or blood    .
- Lymph system    .
The cancer gets into the lymph system , travels through the lymph vessels , and forms a tumor ( metastatic tumor ) in another part of the body    .
- Blood    .
The cancer gets into the blood , travels through the blood vessels , and forms a tumor ( metastatic tumor ) in another part of the body    .
The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor    .
For example , if soft tissue sarcoma spreads to the lung , the cancer cells in the lung are actually soft tissue sarcoma cells    .
The disease is metastatic soft tissue sarcoma , not lung cancer    .
The following stages are used for adult soft tissue sarcoma :
Stage I Stage I is divided into stages IA and IB : - In stage IA , the tumor is low - grade ( likely to grow and spread slowly ) and 5 centimeters or smaller    .
It may be either superficial ( in subcutaneous tissue with no spread into connective tissue or muscle below ) or deep ( in the muscle and may be in connective or subcutaneous tissue )    .
- In stage IB , the tumor is low - grade ( likely to grow and spread slowly ) and larger than 5 centimeters    .
It may be either superficial ( in subcutaneous tissue with no spread into connective tissue or muscle below ) or deep ( in the muscle and may be in connective or subcutaneous tissue )    .
Stage II Stage II is divided into stages IIA and IIB : - In stage IIA , the tumor is mid-grade ( somewhat likely to grow and spread quickly ) or high - grade ( likely to grow and spread quickly ) and 5 centimeters or smaller    .
It may be either superficial ( in subcutaneous tissue with no spread into connective tissue or muscle below ) or deep ( in the muscle and may be in connective or subcutaneous tissue )    .
- In stage IIB , the tumor is mid-grade ( somewhat likely to grow and spread quickly ) and larger than 5 centimeters    .
It may be either superficial ( in subcutaneous tissue with no spread into connective tissue or muscle below ) or deep ( in the muscle and may be in connective or subcutaneous tissue )    .
Stage III
In stage III , the tumor is either : - high - grade ( likely to grow and spread quickly ) , larger than 5 centimeters , and either superficial ( in subcutaneous tissue with no spread into connective tissue or muscle below ) or deep ( in the muscle and may be in connective or subcutaneous tissue ) ; or - any grade , any size , and has spread to nearby lymph nodes    .
Stage III cancer that has spread to the lymph nodes is advanced stage III    .
Stage IV
In stage IV , the tumor is any grade , any size , and may have spread to nearby lymph nodes    .
Cancer has spread to distant parts of the body , such as the lungs    .
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Adult Soft Tissue Sarcoma ?

Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
For some patients , taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice    .
Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process    .
Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment    .
Many of today 's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials    .
Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment    .
Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future    .
Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments , they often answer important questions and help move research forward    .
Patients can enter clinical trials before , during , or after starting their cancer treatment    .
Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment    .
Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better    .
There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring ( coming back ) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment    .
Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country    .
See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials    .

There are different types of treatment for patients with adult soft tissue sarcoma    .
Different types of treatments are available for patients with adult soft tissue sarcoma    .
Some treatments are standard ( the currently used treatment ) , and some are being tested in clinical trials    .
A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer    .
When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment , the new treatment may become the standard treatment    .
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment    .
Three types of standard treatment are used :
Surgery Surgery is the most common treatment for adult soft tissue sarcoma    .
For some soft - tissue sarcomas , removal of the tumor in surgery may be the only treatment needed    .
The following surgical procedures may be used : - Mohs microsurgery : A procedure in which the tumor is cut from the skin in thin layers    .
During surgery , the edges of the tumor and each layer of tumor removed are viewed through a microscope to check for cancer cells    .
Layers continue to be removed until no more cancer cells are seen    .
This type of surgery removes as little normal tissue as possible and is often used where appearance is important , such as on the skin    .
- Wide local excision : Removal of the tumor along with some normal tissue around it    .
For tumors of the head , neck , abdomen , and trunk , as little normal tissue as possible is removed    .
- Limb - sparing surgery : Removal of the tumor in an arm or leg without amputation , so the use and appearance of the limb is saved    .
Radiation therapy or chemotherapy may be given first to shrink the tumor    .
The tumor is then removed in a wide local excision    .
Tissue and bone that are removed may be replaced with a graft using tissue and bone taken from another part of the patient 's body , or with an implant such as artificial bone    .
- Amputation : Surgery to remove part or all of a limb or appendage , such as an arm or leg    .
Amputation is rarely used to treat soft tissue sarcoma of the arm or leg    .
- Lymphadenectomy : A surgical procedure in which lymph nodes are removed and a sample of tissue is checked under a microscope for signs of cancer    .
This procedure is also called a lymph node dissection    .
Radiation therapy or chemotherapy may be given before or after surgery to remove the tumor    .
When given before surgery , radiation therapy or chemotherapy will make the tumor smaller and reduce the amount of tissue that needs to be removed during surgery    .
Treatment given before surgery is called neoadjuvant therapy    .
When given after surgery , radiation therapy or chemotherapy will kill any remaining cancer cells    .
Treatment given after the surgery , to lower the risk that the cancer will come back , is called adjuvant therapy    .
Radiation therapy Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high - energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing    .
There are two types of radiation therapy : - External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer    .
- Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles , seeds , wires , or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer    .
Intensity - modulated radiation therapy ( IMRT ) is a type of 3 - dimensional ( 3 - D ) radiation therapy that uses a computer to make pictures of the size and shape of the tumor    .
Thin beams of radiation of different intensities ( strengths ) are aimed at the tumor from many angles    .
This type of external radiation therapy causes less damage to nearby healthy tissue and is less likely to cause dry mouth , trouble swallowing , and damage to the skin    .
The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated    .
External radiation therapy and internal radiation therapy may be used to treat adult soft tissue sarcoma    .
Chemotherapy Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells , either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing    .
When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle , the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body ( systemic chemotherapy )    .
The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated    .
See Drugs Approved for Soft Tissue Sarcoma for more information    .
New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials    .
This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials    .
It may not mention every new treatment being studied    .
Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website    .
Regional chemotherapy Clinical trials are studying ways to improve the effect of chemotherapy on tumor cells , including the following : - Regional hyperthermia therapy : A treatment in which tissue around the tumor is exposed to high temperatures to damage and kill cancer cells or to make cancer cells more sensitive to chemotherapy    .
- Isolated limb perfusion : A procedure that sends chemotherapy directly to an arm or leg in which the cancer has formed    .
The flow of blood to and from the limb is temporarily stopped with a tourniquet , and anticancer drugs are put directly into the blood of the limb    .
This sends a high dose of drugs to the tumor    .
Treatment for adult soft tissue sarcoma may cause side effects    .
For information about side effects caused by treatment for cancer , see our Side Effects page    .

See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials    .
These have been retrieved from NCI 's listing of clinical trials    .
Follow - up tests may be needed    .
Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated    .
Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working    .
Decisions about whether to continue , change , or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests    .
Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended    .
The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred ( come back )    .
These tests are sometimes called follow - up tests or check - ups    .

What is (are) Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors ?

Key Points
- Gastrointestinal stromal tumor is a disease in which abnormal cells form in the tissues of the gastrointestinal tract    .
- Genetic factors can increase the risk of having a gastrointestinal stromal tumor    .
- Signs of gastrointestinal stromal tumors include blood in the stool or vomit    .
- Tests that examine the GI tract are used to detect ( find ) and diagnose gastrointestinal stromal tumors    .
- Very small GISTs are common    .
- Certain factors affect prognosis ( chance of recovery ) and treatment options    .
Gastrointestinal stromal tumor is a disease in which abnormal cells form in the tissues of the gastrointestinal tract    .
The gastrointestinal ( GI ) tract is part of the bodys digestive system    .
It helps to digest food and takes nutrients ( vitamins , minerals , carbohydrates , fats , proteins , and water ) from food so they can be used by the body    .
The GI tract is made up of the following organs : - Stomach    .    - Small intestine    .    - Large intestine ( colon )    .
Gastrointestinal stromal tumors ( GISTs ) may be malignant ( cancer ) or benign ( not cancer )    .
They are most common in the stomach and small intestine but may be found anywhere in or near the GI tract    .
Some scientists believe that GISTs begin in cells called interstitial cells of Cajal ( ICC ) , in the wall of the GI tract    .
See the PDQ summary about Unusual Cancers of Childhood Treatment for information on the treatment of GIST in children    .
Very small GISTs are common    .
Sometimes GISTs are smaller than the eraser on top of a pencil    .
Tumors may be found during a procedure that is done for another reason , such as an x-ray or surgery    .
Some of these small tumors will not grow and cause signs or symptoms or spread to the abdomen or other parts of the body    .
Doctors do not agree on whether these small tumors should be removed or whether they should be watched to see if they begin to grow    .
Who is at risk for Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors? ?

Genetic factors can increase the risk of having a gastrointestinal stromal tumor    .
Anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor    .
Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer ; not having risk factors does n't mean that you will not get cancer    .
Talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk    .
The genes in cells carry the hereditary information received from a persons parents    .
The risk of GIST is increased in people who have inherited a mutation ( change ) in a certain gene    .
In rare cases , GISTs can be found in several members of the same family    .
GIST may be part of a genetic syndrome , but this is rare    .
A genetic syndrome is a set of symptoms or conditions that occur together and is usually caused by abnormal genes    .
The following genetic syndromes have been linked to GIST : - Neurofibromatosis type 1 ( NF1 )    .    - Carney triad    .
What are the symptoms of Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors ?

Signs of gastrointestinal stromal tumors include blood in the stool or vomit    .
These and other signs and symptoms may be caused by a GIST or by other conditions    .
Check with your doctor if you have any of the following : - Blood ( either bright red or very dark ) in the stool or vomit    .
- Pain in the abdomen , which may be severe    .
- Feeling very tired    .
- Trouble or pain when swallowing    .
- Feeling full after only a little food is eaten    .
What are the stages of Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors ?

Key Points
- After a gastrointestinal stromal tumor has been diagnosed , tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the gastrointestinal tract or to other parts of the body    .
- There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body    .
- Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body    .
- The results of diagnostic and staging tests are used to plan treatment    .
After a gastrointestinal stromal tumor has been diagnosed , tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the gastrointestinal tract or to other parts of the body    .
The process used to find out if cancer has spread within the gastrointestinal ( GI ) tract or to other parts of the body is called staging    .
The information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease    .
The following tests and procedures may be used in the staging process : - PET scan ( positron emission tomography scan ) : A procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body    .
A small amount of radioactive glucose ( sugar ) is injected into a vein    .
The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body    .

- Chest x-ray :
An x-ray of the organs and bones inside the chest    .
An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film , making a picture of areas inside the body    .
- Bone scan :
A procedure to check if there are rapidly dividing cells , such as cancer cells , in the bone    .
A very small amount of radioactive material is injected into a vein and travels through the bloodstream    .
The radioactive material collects in the bones and is detected by a scanner    .
There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body    .
Cancer can spread through tissue , the lymph system , and the blood : - Tissue    .
The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas    .
- Lymph system    .
The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system    .
The cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body    .
- Blood    .
The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood    .
The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body    .
Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body    .
When cancer spreads to another part of the body , it is called metastasis    .
Cancer cells break away from where they began ( the primary tumor ) and travel through the lymph system or blood    .
- Lymph system    .
The cancer gets into the lymph system , travels through the lymph vessels , and forms a tumor ( metastatic tumor ) in another part of the body    .
- Blood    .
The cancer gets into the blood , travels through the blood vessels , and forms a tumor ( metastatic tumor ) in another part of the body    .
The metastatic tumor is the same type of tumor as the primary tumor    .
For example , if a gastrointestinal stromal tumor ( GIST ) spreads to the liver , the tumor cells in the liver are actually GIST cells    .
The disease is metastatic GIST , not liver cancer    .
The results of diagnostic and staging tests are used to plan treatment    .
For many cancers it is important to know the stage of the cancer in order to plan treatment    .
However , the treatment of GIST is not based on the stage of the cancer    .
Treatment is based on whether the tumor can be removed by surgery and if the tumor has spread to other parts of the abdomen or to distant parts of the body    .
Treatment is based on whether the tumor is : - Resectable :
These tumors can be removed by surgery    .
- Unresectable :
These tumors cannot be completely removed by surgery    .
- Metastatic and recurrent : Metastatic tumors have spread to other parts of the body    .
Recurrent tumors have recurred ( come back ) after treatment    .
Recurrent GISTs may come back in the gastrointestinal tract or in other parts of the body    .
They are usually found in the abdomen , peritoneum , and / or liver    .
- Refractory :
These tumors have not gotten better with treatment    .
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors ?

New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials    .
Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website    .

What are the treatments for Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors ?

Key Points
- There are different types of treatment for patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumors    .
- Four types of standard treatment are used : - Surgery - Targeted therapy - Watchful waiting - Supportive care - New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials    .
- Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
- Patients can enter clinical trials before , during , or after starting their cancer treatment    .
- Follow - up tests may be needed    .
There are different types of treatment for patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumors    .
Different types of treatments are available for patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumors ( GISTs )    .
Some treatments are standard ( the currently used treatment ) , and some are being tested in clinical trials    .
A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer    .
When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment , the new treatment may become the standard treatment    .
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment    .
Four types of standard treatment are used :
Surgery
If the GIST has not spread and is in a place where surgery can be safely done , the tumor and some of the tissue around it may be removed    .
Sometimes surgery is done using a laparoscope ( a thin , lighted tube ) to see inside the body    .
Small incisions ( cuts ) are made in the wall of the abdomen and a laparoscope is inserted into one of the incisions    .
Instruments may be inserted through the same incision or through other incisions to remove organs or tissues    .
Targeted therapy Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells    .
Tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( TKIs ) are targeted therapy drugs that block signals needed for tumors to grow    .
TKIs may be used to treat GISTs that cannot be removed by surgery or to shrink GISTs so they become small enough to be removed by surgery    .
Imatinib mesylate and sunitinib are two TKIs used to treat GISTs    .
TKIs are sometimes given for as long as the tumor does not grow and serious side effects do not occur    .
See Drugs Approved for Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors for more information    .
Watchful waiting Watchful waiting is closely monitoring a patients condition without giving any treatment until signs or symptoms appear or change    .
Supportive care
If a GIST gets worse during treatment or there are side effects , supportive care is usually given    .
The goal of supportive care is to prevent or treat the symptoms of a disease , side effects caused by treatment , and psychological , social , and spiritual problems related to a disease or its treatment    .
Supportive care helps improve the quality of life of patients who have a serious or life - threatening disease    .
Radiation therapy is sometimes given as supportive care to relieve pain in patients with large tumors that have spread    .
New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials    .
Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website    .
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
For some patients , taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice    .
Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process    .
Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment    .
Many of today 's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials    .
Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment    .
Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future    .
Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments , they often answer important questions and help move research forward    .
Patients can enter clinical trials before , during , or after starting their cancer treatment    .
Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment    .
Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better    .
There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring ( coming back ) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment    .
Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country    .
See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials    .
These have been retrieved from NCI 's listing of clinical trials    .
Follow - up tests may be needed    .
Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated    .
Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working    .
Decisions about whether to continue , change , or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests    .
Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended    .
The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred ( come back )    .
These tests are sometimes called follow - up tests or check - ups    .
Follow - up for GISTs that were removed by surgery may include CT scan of the liver and pelvis or watchful waiting    .
For GISTs that are treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors , follow - up tests , such as CT , MRI , or PET scans , may be done to check how well the targeted therapy is working    .
Treatment Options for Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors
Resectable Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors
Resectable gastrointestinal stromal tumors ( GISTs ) can be completely or almost completely removed by surgery    .
Treatment may include the following : - Surgery to remove tumors that are 2 centimeters or larger    .
Laparoscopic surgery may be done if the tumor is 5 cm or smaller    .
If there are cancer cells remaining at the edges of the area where the tumor was removed , watchful waiting or targeted therapy with imatinib mesylate may follow    .
- A clinical trial of targeted therapy with imatinib mesylate following surgery , to decrease the chance the tumor will recur ( come back )    .
Unresectable Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors
Unresectable GISTs cannot be completely removed by surgery because they are too large or in a place where there would be too much damage to nearby organs if the tumor is removed    .
Treatment is usually a clinical trial of targeted therapy with imatinib mesylate to shrink the tumor , followed by surgery to remove as much of the tumor as possible    .
Metastatic and Recurrent Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors
Treatment of GISTs that are metastatic ( spread to other parts of the body ) or recurrent ( came back after treatment ) may include the following : - Targeted therapy with imatinib mesylate    .
- Targeted therapy with sunitinib , if the tumor begins to grow during imatinib mesylate therapy or if the side effects are too bad    .
- Surgery to remove tumors that have been treated with targeted therapy and are shrinking , stable ( not changing ) , or that have slightly increased in size    .
Targeted therapy may continue after surgery    .
- Surgery to remove tumors when there are serious complications , such as bleeding , a hole in the gastrointestinal ( GI ) tract , a blocked GI tract , or infection    .    - A clinical trial of a new treatment    .
Refractory Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors
Many GISTs treated with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKI ) become refractory ( stop responding ) to the drug after a while    .
Treatment is usually a clinical trial with a different TKI or a clinical trial of a new drug    .
Treatment Options in Clinical Trials
Check the list of NCI - supported cancer clinical trials that are now accepting patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumor    .
For more specific results , refine the search by using other search features , such as the location of the trial , the type of treatment , or the name of the drug    .
Talk with your doctor about clinical trials that may be right for you    .
General information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website    .
What is (are) Kaposi Sarcoma ?

Key Points
- Kaposi sarcoma is a disease in which malignant tumors ( cancer ) can form in the skin , mucous membranes , lymph nodes , and other organs    .
- Tests that examine the skin , lungs , and gastrointestinal tract are used to detect ( find ) and diagnose Kaposi sarcoma    .
- After Kaposi sarcoma has been diagnosed , tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread to other parts of the body    .
- Certain factors affect prognosis ( chance of recovery ) and treatment options    .
Kaposi sarcoma is a disease in which malignant tumors ( cancer ) can form in the skin , mucous membranes , lymph nodes , and other organs    .
Kaposi sarcoma is a cancer that causes lesions ( abnormal tissue ) to grow in the skin ; the mucous membranes lining the mouth , nose , and throat ; lymph nodes ; or other organs    .
The lesions are usually purple and are made of cancer cells , new blood vessels , red blood cells , and white blood cells    .
Kaposi sarcoma is different from other cancers in that lesions may begin in more than one place in the body at the same time    .
Human herpesvirus - 8 ( HHV - 8 ) is found in the lesions of all patients with Kaposi sarcoma    .
This virus is also called Kaposi sarcoma herpesvirus ( KSHV )    .
Most people infected with HHV - 8 do not get Kaposi sarcoma    .
Those infected with HHV - 8 who are most likely to develop Kaposi sarcoma have immune systems weakened by disease or by drugs given after an organ transplant    .
There are several types of Kaposi sarcoma , including : - Classic Kaposi sarcoma    .    - African Kaposi sarcoma    .    - Immunosuppressive therapyrelated Kaposi sarcoma    .    - Epidemic Kaposi sarcoma    .    - Nonepidemic Kaposi sarcoma    .
Tests that examine the skin , lungs , and gastrointestinal tract are used to detect ( find ) and diagnose Kaposi sarcoma    .
The following tests and procedures may be used : - Physical exam and history :
An exam of the body to check general signs of health , including checking skin and lymph nodes for signs of disease , such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual    .
A history of the patient 's health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken    .
- Chest x-ray :
An x-ray of the organs and bones inside the chest    .
An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film , making a picture of areas inside the body    .
This is used to find Kaposi sarcoma in the lungs    .
- Biopsy :
The removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer    .
One of the following types of biopsies may be done to check for Kaposi sarcoma lesions in the skin : - Excisional biopsy :
A scalpel is used to remove the entire skin growth    .

- Endoscopy for biopsy : A procedure to look at organs and tissues inside the body to check for abnormal areas    .
An endoscope is inserted through an incision ( cut ) in the skin or opening in the body , such as the mouth    .
An endoscope is a thin , tube - like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing    .
It may also have a tool to remove tissue or lymph node samples , which are checked under a microscope for signs of disease    .
This is used to find Kaposi sarcoma lesions in the gastrointestinal tract    .
- Bronchoscopy for biopsy : A procedure to look inside the trachea and large airways in the lung for abnormal areas    .
A bronchoscope is inserted through the nose or mouth into the trachea and lungs    .
A bronchoscope is a thin , tube - like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing    .
It may also have a tool to remove tissue samples , which are checked under a microscope for signs of disease    .
This is used to find Kaposi sarcoma lesions in the lungs    .
After Kaposi sarcoma has been diagnosed , tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread to other parts of the body    .
The following tests and procedures may be used to find out if cancer has spread to other parts of the body : - Blood chemistry studies :
A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body    .
An unusual ( higher or lower than normal ) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease    .
- CT scan ( CAT scan ) : A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body , such as the lung , liver , and spleen , taken from different angles    .
The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine    .
A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly    .
This procedure is also called computed tomography , computerized tomography , or computerized axial tomography    .
- PET scan ( positron emission tomography scan ) : A procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body    .
A small amount of radioactive glucose ( sugar ) is injected into a vein    .
The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body    .
Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do    .
This imaging test checks for signs of cancer in the lung , liver , and spleen    .
- CD34 lymphocyte count : A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amount of CD34 cells ( a type of white blood cell )    .
A lower than normal amount of CD34 cells can be a sign the immune system is not working well    .
Certain factors affect prognosis ( chance of recovery ) and treatment options    .
The prognosis ( chance of recovery ) and treatment options depend on the following : - The type of Kaposi sarcoma    .    - The general health of the patient , especially the patient 's immune system    .
- Whether the cancer has just been diagnosed or has recurred ( come back )    .

Signs of classic Kaposi sarcoma may include slow - growing lesions on the legs and feet    .
Patients may have one or more red , purple , or brown skin lesions on the legs and feet , most often on the ankles or soles of the feet    .
Over time , lesions may form in other parts of the body , such as the stomach , intestines , or lymph nodes    .
The lesions usually do n't cause any symptoms , but may grow in size and number over a period of 10 years or more    .
Pressure from the lesions may block the flow of lymph and blood in the legs and cause painful swelling    .
Lesions in the digestive tract may cause gastrointestinal bleeding    .
Another cancer may develop    .
Some patients with classic Kaposi sarcoma may develop another type of cancer before the Kaposi sarcoma lesions appear or later in life    .
Most often , this second cancer is non-Hodgkin lymphoma    .
Frequent follow - up is needed to watch for these second cancers    .

- Treatment of epidemic Kaposi sarcoma combines treatment for Kaposi sarcoma with treatment for AIDS    .
- Four types of standard treatment are used to treat Kaposi sarcoma : - Radiation therapy - Surgery - Chemotherapy - Biologic therapy - New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials    .
- Targeted therapy - Treatment for Kaposi sarcoma may cause side effects    .
- Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
- Patients can enter clinical trials before , during , or after starting their cancer treatment    .
- Follow - up tests may be needed    .
There are different types of treatment for patients with Kaposi sarcoma    .
Different types of treatments are available for patients with Kaposi sarcoma    .
Some treatments are standard ( the currently used treatment ) , and some are being tested in clinical trials    .
A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer    .
When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment , the new treatment may become the standard treatment    .
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment    .
Treatment of epidemic Kaposi sarcoma combines treatment for Kaposi sarcoma with treatment for AIDS    .
For the treatment of epidemic Kaposi sarcoma , combined antiretroviral therapy ( cART ) is used to slow the progression of AIDS    .
cART may be combined with anticancer drugs and medicines that prevent and treat infections    .
Four types of standard treatment are used to treat Kaposi sarcoma :
Radiation therapy Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high - energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing    .
There are two types of radiation therapy : - External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer    .
- Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles , seeds , wires , or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer    .
The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type of the cancer being treated    .
Certain types of external radiation therapy are used to treat Kaposi sarcoma lesions    .
Photon radiation therapy treats lesions with high - energy light    .
Electron beam radiation therapy uses tiny negatively charged particles called electrons    .
Surgery
The following surgical procedures may be used for Kaposi sarcoma to treat small , surface lesions : - Local excision :
The cancer is cut from the skin along with a small amount of normal tissue around it    .
- Electrodesiccation and curettage :
The tumor is cut from the skin with a curette ( a sharp , spoon - shaped tool )    .
A needle - shaped electrode is then used to treat the area with an electric current that stops the bleeding and destroys cancer cells that remain around the edge of the wound    .
The process may be repeated one to three times during the surgery to remove all of the cancer    .
- Cryosurgery : A treatment that uses an instrument to freeze and destroy abnormal tissue    .
This type of treatment is also called cryotherapy    .
Chemotherapy Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells , either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing    .
When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle , the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body ( systemic chemotherapy )    .
When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid , an organ , tissue , or a body cavity such as the abdomen , the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas ( regional chemotherapy )    .
In electrochemotherapy , intravenous chemotherapy is given and a probe is used to send electric pulses to the tumor    .
The pulses make an opening in the membrane around the tumor cell and allow the chemotherapy to get inside    .
Electrochemotherapy is being studied in the treatment of Kaposi sarcoma    .
The way the chemotherapy is given depends on where the Kaposi sarcoma lesions occur in the body    .
In Kaposi sarcoma , chemotherapy may be given in the following ways : - For local Kaposi sarcoma lesions , such as in the mouth , anticancer drugs may be injected directly into the lesion ( intralesional chemotherapy )    .
- For local lesions on the skin , a topical agent may be applied to the skin as a gel    .
Electrochemotherapy may also be used    .
- For widespread lesions on the skin , intravenous chemotherapy may be given    .
Liposomal chemotherapy uses liposomes ( very tiny fat particles ) to carry anticancer drugs    .
Liposomal doxorubicin is used to treat Kaposi sarcoma    .
The liposomes build up in Kaposi sarcoma tissue more than in healthy tissue , and the doxorubicin is released slowly    .
This increases the effect of the doxorubicin and causes less damage to healthy tissue    .
See Drugs Approved for Kaposi Sarcoma for more information    .
Biologic therapy Biologic therapy is a treatment that uses the patient 's immune system to fight cancer    .
Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost , direct , or restore the body 's natural defenses against cancer    .
This type of cancer treatment is also called biotherapy or immunotherapy    .
Interferon alfa is a biologic agent used to treat Kaposi sarcoma    .
See Drugs Approved for Kaposi Sarcoma for more information    .
Treatment for Kaposi sarcoma may cause side effects    .
For information about side effects caused by treatment for cancer , see our Side Effects page    .
New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials    .
This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials    .
It may not mention every new treatment being studied    .
Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website    .
Targeted therapy Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells    .
Monoclonal antibody therapy and tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( TKIs ) are types of targeted therapy being studied in the treatment of Kaposi sarcoma    .
Monoclonal antibody therapy is a cancer treatment that uses antibodies made in the laboratory from a single type of immune system cell    .
These antibodies can identify substances on cancer cells or normal substances that may help cancer cells grow    .
The antibodies attach to the substances and kill the cancer cells , block their growth , or keep them from spreading    .
Monoclonal antibodies are given by infusion    .
These may be used alone or to carry drugs , toxins , or radioactive material directly to cancer cells    .
Bevacizumab is a monoclonal antibody that is being studied in the treatment of Kaposi sarcoma    .
TKIs are targeted therapy drugs that block signals needed for tumors to grow    .
Imatinib mesylate is a TKI being studied in the treatment of Kaposi sarcoma    .
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
For some patients , taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice    .
Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process    .
Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment    .
Many of today 's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials    .
Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment    .
Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future    .
Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments , they often answer important questions and help move research forward    .
Patients can enter clinical trials before , during , or after starting their cancer treatment    .
Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment    .
Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better    .
There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring ( coming back ) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment    .
Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country    .
See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials    .
These have been retrieved from NCI 's listing of clinical trials    .
Follow - up tests may be needed    .
Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated    .
Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working    .
Decisions about whether to continue , change , or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests    .
Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended    .
The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred ( come back )    .
These tests are sometimes called follow - up tests or check - ups    .

Who is at risk for Childhood Rhabdomyosarcoma? ?

Certain genetic conditions increase the risk of childhood rhabdomyosarcoma    .
Anything that increases the risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor    .
Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer ; not having risk factors doesnt mean that you will not get cancer    .
Talk with your childs doctor if you think your child may be at risk    .
Risk factors for rhabdomyosarcoma include having the following inherited diseases : - Li-Fraumeni syndrome    .    - Pleuropulmonary blastoma    .    - Neurofibromatosis type 1 ( NF1 )    .    - Costello syndrome    .
- Beckwith - Wiedemann syndrome    .    - Noonan syndrome    .
Children who had a high birth weight or were larger than expected at birth may have an increased risk of embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma    .
In most cases , the cause of rhabdomyosarcoma is not known    .
What are the symptoms of Childhood Rhabdomyosarcoma ?

A sign of childhood rhabdomyosarcoma is a lump or swelling that keeps getting bigger    .
Signs and symptoms may be caused by childhood rhabdomyosarcoma or by other conditions    .
The signs and symptoms that occur depend on where the cancer forms    .
Check with your child 's doctor if your child has any of the following : - A lump or swelling that keeps getting bigger or does not go away    .
It may be painful    .
- Bulging of the eye    .    - Headache    .    - Trouble urinating or having bowel movements    .
- Blood in the urine    .
- Bleeding in the nose , throat , vagina , or rectum    .
How to diagnose Childhood Rhabdomyosarcoma ?

Diagnostic tests and a biopsy are used to detect ( find ) and diagnose childhood rhabdomyosarcoma    .
The diagnostic tests that are done depend in part on where the cancer forms    .
The following tests and procedures may be used : - Physical exam and history :
An exam of the body to check general signs of health , including checking for signs of disease , such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual    .
A history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken    .
- X-ray :
An x-ray of the organs and bones inside the body , such as the chest    .
An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film , making a picture of areas inside the body    .
- CT scan ( CAT scan ) : A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body , such as the abdomen , pelvis , or lymph nodes , taken from different angles    .
The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine    .
A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly    .
This procedure is also called computed tomography , computerized tomography , or computerized axial tomography    .
- MRI ( magnetic resonance imaging ) : A procedure that uses a magnet , radio waves , and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas of the body , such as the skull , brain , and lymph nodes    .
This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging ( NMRI )    .
- PET scan ( positron emission tomography scan ) : A procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body    .
A small amount of radioactive glucose ( sugar ) is injected into a vein    .
The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body    .
Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do    .
- Bone scan :
A procedure to check if there are rapidly dividing cells , such as cancer cells , in the bone    .
A very small amount of radioactive material is injected into a vein and travels through the bloodstream    .
The radioactive material collects in the bones with cancer and is detected by a scanner    .
- Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy :
The removal of bone marrow , blood , and a small piece of bone by inserting a hollow needle into the hipbone    .
Samples are removed from both hipbones    .
A pathologist views the bone marrow , blood , and bone under a microscope to look for signs of cancer    .
- Lumbar puncture : A procedure used to collect cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) from the spinal column    .
This is done by placing a needle between two bones in the spine and into the CSF around the spinal cord and removing a sample of the fluid    .
The sample of CSF is checked under a microscope for signs of cancer cells    .
This procedure is also called an LP or spinal tap    .
If these tests show there may be a rhabdomyosarcoma , a biopsy is done    .
A biopsy is the removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer    .
Because treatment depends on the type of rhabdomyosarcoma , biopsy samples should be checked by a pathologist who has experience in diagnosing rhabdomyosarcoma    .
One of the following types of biopsies may be used : - Fine - needle aspiration ( FNA ) biopsy :
The removal of tissue or fluid using a thin needle    .
- Core needle biopsy :
The removal of tissue using a wide needle    .
This procedure may be guided using ultrasound , CT scan , or MRI    .
- Open biopsy :
The removal of tissue through an incision ( cut ) made in the skin    .
- Sentinel lymph node biopsy :
The removal of the sentinel lymph node during surgery    .
The sentinel lymph node is the first lymph node to receive lymphatic drainage from a tumor    .
It is the first lymph node the cancer is likely to spread to from the tumor    .
A radioactive substance and / or blue dye is injected near the tumor    .
The substance or dye flows through the lymph ducts to the lymph nodes    .
The first lymph node to receive the substance or dye is removed    .
A pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells    .
If cancer cells are not found , it may not be necessary to remove more lymph nodes    .
The following tests may be done on the sample of tissue that is removed : - Light microscopy : A laboratory test in which cells in a sample of tissue are viewed under regular and high - powered microscopes to look for certain changes in the cells    .
- Immunohistochemistry :
A test that uses antibodies to check for certain antigens in a sample of tissue    .
The antibody is usually linked to a radioactive substance or a dye that causes the tissue to light up under a microscope    .
This type of test may be used to tell the difference between different types of cancer    .
- FISH ( fluorescence in situ hybridization ) : A laboratory test used to look at genes or chromosomes in cells and tissues    .
Pieces of DNA that contain a fluorescent dye are made in the laboratory and added to cells or tissues on a glass slide    .
When these pieces of DNA attach to certain genes or areas of chromosomes on the slide , they light up when viewed under a microscope with a special light    .
This type of test is used to find certain gene changes    .
- Reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction ( RTPCR ) test : A laboratory test in which cells in a sample of tissue are studied using chemicals to look for certain changes in the structure or function of genes    .
- Cytogenetic analysis :
A laboratory test in which cells in a sample of tissue are viewed under a microscope to look for certain changes in the chromosomes    .
What is the outlook for Childhood Rhabdomyosarcoma ?

Certain factors affect prognosis ( chance of recovery ) and treatment options    .
The prognosis ( chance of recovery ) and treatment options depend on the following : - The patient 's age    .
- Where in the body the tumor started    .
- The size of the tumor at the time of diagnosis    .
- Whether the tumor has been completely removed by surgery    .
- The type of rhabdomyosarcoma ( embryonal , alveolar , or anaplastic )    .
- Whether there are certain changes in the genes    .
- Whether the tumor had spread to other parts of the body at the time of diagnosis    .
- Whether the tumor was in the lymph nodes at the time of diagnosis    .
- Whether the tumor responds to chemotherapy and / or radiation therapy    .
For patients with recurrent cancer , prognosis and treatment also depend on the following : - Where in the body the tumor recurred ( came back )    .
- How much time passed between the end of cancer treatment and when the cancer recurred    .
- Whether the tumor was treated with radiation therapy    .
What are the stages of Childhood Rhabdomyosarcoma ?

Key Points
- After childhood rhabdomyosarcoma has been diagnosed , treatment is based in part on the stage of the cancer and sometimes it is based on whether all the cancer was removed by surgery    .
- There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body    .
- Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body    .
- Staging of childhood rhabdomyosarcoma is done in three parts    .
- The staging system is based on the size of the tumor , where it is in the body , and whether it has spread to other parts of the body : - Stage 1 - Stage 2 - Stage 3 - Stage 4 - The grouping system is based on whether the cancer has spread and whether all the cancer was removed by surgery : - Group I - Group II - Group III - Group IV - The risk group is based on the staging system and the grouping system    .
- Low - risk childhood rhabdomyosarcoma - Intermediate - risk childhood rhabdomyosarcoma - High - risk childhood rhabdomyosarcoma
After childhood rhabdomyosarcoma has been diagnosed , treatment is based in part on the stage of the cancer and sometimes it is based on whether all the cancer was removed by surgery    .
The process used to find out if cancer has spread within the tissue or to other parts of the body is called staging    .
It is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment    .
The doctor will use results of the diagnostic tests to help find out the stage of the disease    .
Treatment for childhood rhabdomyosarcoma is based in part on the stage and sometimes on the amount of cancer that remains after surgery to remove the tumor    .
The pathologist will use a microscope to check the tissues removed during surgery , including tissue samples from the edges of the areas where the cancer was removed and the lymph nodes    .
This is done to see if all the cancer cells were taken out during the surgery    .
There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body    .
Cancer can spread through tissue , the lymph system , and the blood : - Tissue    .
The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas    .
- Lymph system    .
The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system    .
The cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body    .
- Blood    .
The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood    .
The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body    .
Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body    .
When cancer spreads to another part of the body , it is called metastasis    .
Cancer cells break away from where they began ( the primary tumor ) and travel through the lymph system or blood    .
- Lymph system    .
The cancer gets into the lymph system , travels through the lymph vessels , and forms a tumor ( metastatic tumor ) in another part of the body    .
- Blood    .
The cancer gets into the blood , travels through the blood vessels , and forms a tumor ( metastatic tumor ) in another part of the body    .
The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor    .
For example , if rhabdomyosarcoma spreads to the lung , the cancer cells in the lung are actually rhabdomyosarcoma cells    .
The disease is metastatic rhabdomyosarcoma , not lung cancer    .
Staging of childhood rhabdomyosarcoma is done in three parts    .
Childhood rhabdomyosarcoma is staged by using three different ways to describe the cancer : - A staging system    .    - A grouping system    .    - A risk group    .
The staging system is based on the size of the tumor , where it is in the body , and whether it has spread to other parts of the body :
Stage 1
In stage 1 , the tumor is any size , may have spread to lymph nodes , and is found in only one of the following &quot ; favorable &quot ; sites : - Eye or area around the eye    .
- Head and neck ( but not in the tissue next to the brain and spinal cord )    .
- Gallbladder and bile ducts    .
- Ureters or urethra    .    - Testes , ovary , vagina , or uterus    .
Rhabdomyosarcoma that forms in a &quot ; favorable &quot ; site has a better prognosis    .
If the site where cancer occurs is not one of the favorable sites listed above , it is said to be an &quot ; unfavorable &quot ; site    .
Stage 2
In stage 2 , cancer is found in an &quot ; unfavorable &quot ; site ( any one area not described as & quot ; favorable &quot ; in stage 1 )    .
The tumor is no larger than 5 centimeters and has not spread to lymph nodes    .
Stage 3
In stage 3 , cancer is found in an &quot ; unfavorable &quot ; site ( any one area not described as & quot ; favorable &quot ; in stage 1 ) and one of the following is true : - The tumor is no larger than 5 centimeters and cancer has spread to nearby lymph nodes    .
- The tumor is larger than 5 centimeters and cancer may have spread to nearby lymph nodes    .
Stage 4
In stage 4 , the tumor may be any size and cancer may have spread to nearby lymph nodes    .
Cancer has spread to distant parts of the body , such as the lung , bone marrow , or bone    .
The grouping system is based on whether the cancer has spread and whether all the cancer was removed by surgery :
Group I Cancer was found only in the place where it started and it was completely removed by surgery    .
Tissue was taken from the edges of where the tumor was removed    .
The tissue was checked under a microscope by a pathologist and no cancer cells were found    .
Group II Group II is divided into groups IIA , IIB , and IIC    .
- IIA : Cancer was removed by surgery but cancer cells were seen when the tissue , taken from the edges of where the tumor was removed , was viewed under a microscope by a pathologist    .
- IIB : Cancer had spread to nearby lymph nodes and the cancer and lymph nodes were removed by surgery    .
- IIC : Cancer had spread to nearby lymph nodes , the cancer and lymph nodes were removed by surgery , and at least one of the following is true : - Tissue taken from the edges of where the tumor was removed was checked under a microscope by a pathologist and cancer cells were seen    .
- The furthest lymph node from the tumor that was removed was checked under a microscope by a pathologist and cancer cells were seen    .
Group III
Cancer was partly removed by biopsy or surgery but there is tumor remaining that can be seen with the eye    .
Group IV
Cancer had spread to distant parts of the body when the cancer was diagnosed    .
- Cancer cells are found by an imaging test ; or - There are cancer cells in the fluid around the brain , spinal cord , or lungs , or in fluid in the abdomen ; or tumors are found in those areas    .
The risk group is based on the staging system and the grouping system    .
The risk group describes the chance that rhabdomyosarcoma will recur ( come back )    .
Every child treated for rhabdomyosarcoma should receive chemotherapy to decrease the chance cancer will recur    .
The type of anticancer drug , dose , and the number of treatments given depends on whether the child has low - risk , intermediate - risk , or high - risk rhabdomyosarcoma    .
The following risk groups are used : Low - risk childhood rhabdomyosarcoma Low - risk childhood rhabdomyosarcoma is one of the following : - An embryonal tumor of any size that is found in a &quot ; favorable &quot ; site    .
There may be tumor remaining after surgery that can be seen with or without a microscope    .
The cancer may have spread to nearby lymph nodes    .
The following areas are &quot ; favorable &quot ; sites : - Eye or area around the eye    .
- Head or neck ( but not in the tissue near the ear , nose , sinuses , or base of the skull )    .
- Gallbladder and bile ducts    .
- Ureter or urethra    .    - Testes , ovary , vagina , or uterus    .    - An embryonal tumor of any size that is not found in a &quot ; favorable &quot ; site    .
There may be tumor remaining after surgery that can be seen only with a microscope    .
The cancer may have spread to nearby lymph nodes    .
Intermediate - risk childhood rhabdomyosarcoma
Intermediate - risk childhood rhabdomyosarcoma is one of the following : - An embryonal tumor of any size that is not found in one of the &quot ; favorable &quot ; sites listed above    .
There is tumor remaining after surgery , that can be seen with or without a microscope    .
The cancer may have spread to nearby lymph nodes    .
- An alveolar tumor of any size in a &quot ; favorable &quot ; or &quot ; unfavorable &quot ; site    .
There may be tumor remaining after surgery that can be seen with or without a microscope    .
The cancer may have spread to nearby lymph nodes    .
High - risk childhood rhabdomyosarcoma
High - risk childhood rhabdomyosarcoma may be the embryonal type or the alveolar type    .
It may have spread to nearby lymph nodes and has spread to one or more of the following : - Other parts of the body that are not near where the tumor first formed    .
- Fluid around the brain or spinal cord    .
- Fluid in the lung or abdomen    .
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Childhood Rhabdomyosarcoma ?

New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials    .
This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials    .
It may not mention every new treatment being studied    .
Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website    .
High - dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant High - dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant is a way of giving high doses of chemotherapy and replacing blood - forming cells destroyed by the cancer treatment    .
Stem cells ( immature blood cells ) are removed from the blood or bone marrow of the patient or a donor and are frozen and stored    .
After the chemotherapy is completed , the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion    .
These reinfused stem cells grow into ( and restore ) the body 's blood cells    .
Immunotherapy Immunotherapy is a treatment that uses the patients immune system to fight cancer    .
Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost , direct , or restore the bodys natural defenses against cancer    .
This type of cancer treatment is also called biologic therapy or biotherapy    .
There are different types of immunotherapy : - Immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy uses the body 's immune system to kill cancer cells    .
Two types of immune checkpoint inhibitors are being studied in the treatment of childhood rhabdomyosarcoma that has come back after treatment : - CTLA - 4 is a protein on the surface of T cells that helps keep the bodys immune responses in check    .
When CTLA - 4 attaches to another protein called B7 on a cancer cell , it stops the T cell from killing the cancer cell    .
CTLA - 4 inhibitors attach to CTLA - 4 and allow the T cells to kill cancer cells    .
Ipilimumab is a type of CTLA - 4 inhibitor    .
- PD - 1 is a protein on the surface of T cells that helps keep the bodys immune responses in check    .
When PD - 1 attaches to another protein called PDL - 1 on a cancer cell , it stops the T cell from killing the cancer cell    .
PD - 1 inhibitors attach to PDL - 1 and allow the T cells to kill cancer cells    .
Nivolumab and pembrolizumab are PD - 1 inhibitors    .
- Vaccine therapy is a type of immunotherapy being studied to treat metastatic rhabdomyosarcoma    .
Targeted therapy Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to attack cancer cells    .
Targeted therapies usually cause less harm to normal cells than chemotherapy or radiation do    .
There are different types of targeted therapy : - mTOR inhibitors stop the protein that helps cells divide and survive    .
Sirolimus is a type of mTOR inhibitor therapy being studied in the treatment of recurrent rhabdomyosarcoma    .
- Tyrosine kinase inhibitors are small - molecule drugs that go through the cell membrane and work inside cancer cells to block signals that cancer cells need to grow and divide    .
MK - 1775 is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor being studied in the treatment of recurrent rhabdomyosarcoma    .
- Antibody - drug conjugates are made up of a monoclonal antibody attached to a drug    .
The monoclonal antibody binds to specific proteins or receptors found on certain cells , including cancer cells    .
The drug enters these cells and kills them without harming other cells    .
Lorvotuzumab mertansine is an antibody - drug conjugate being studied in the treatment of recurrent rhabdomyosarcoma    .
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
For some patients , taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice    .
Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process    .
Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment    .
Many of today 's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials    .
Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment    .
Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future    .
Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments , they often answer important questions and help move research forward    .
Patients can enter clinical trials before , during , or after starting their cancer treatment    .
Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment    .
Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better    .
There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring ( coming back ) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment    .
Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country    .
See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials    .

What are the treatments for Childhood Rhabdomyosarcoma ?

Key Points
- There are different types of treatment for patients with childhood rhabdomyosarcoma    .
- Children with rhabdomyosarcoma should have their treatment planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating cancer in children    .
- Treatment for childhood rhabdomyosarcoma may cause side effects    .
- Three types of standard treatment are used : - Surgery - Radiation therapy - Chemotherapy - New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials    .
- High - dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant - Immunotherapy - Targeted therapy - Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
- Patients can enter clinical trials before , during , or after starting their cancer treatment    .
- Follow - up tests may be needed    .
There are different types of treatment for patients with childhood rhabdomyosarcoma    .
Some treatments are standard ( the currently used treatment ) , and some are being tested in clinical trials    .
A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer    .
When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment , the new treatment may become the standard treatment    .
Because cancer in children is rare , taking part in a clinical trial should be considered    .
Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment    .
Children with rhabdomyosarcoma should have their treatment planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating cancer in children    .
Because rhabdomyosarcoma can form in many different parts of the body , many different kinds of treatments are used    .
Treatment will be overseen by a pediatric oncologist , a doctor who specializes in treating children with cancer    .
The pediatric oncologist works with other health care providers who are experts in treating children with rhabdomyosarcoma and who specialize in certain areas of medicine    .
These may include the following specialists : - Pediatrician    .    - Pediatric surgeon    .
- Radiation oncologist    .
- Pediatric hematologist    .
- Pediatric radiologist    .
- Pediatric nurse specialist    .
- Geneticist or cancer genetics risk counselor    .
- Social worker    .
- Rehabilitation specialist    .
Treatment for childhood rhabdomyosarcoma may cause side effects    .
For information about side effects that begin during treatment for cancer , see our Side Effects page    .
Side effects from cancer treatment that begin after treatment and continue for months or years are called late effects    .
Late effects of cancer treatment for rhabdomyosarcoma may include : - Physical problems    .
- Changes in mood , feelings , thinking , learning , or memory    .
- Second cancers ( new types of cancer )    .
Some late effects may be treated or controlled    .
It is important to talk with your child 's doctors about the effects cancer treatment can have on your child    .
( See the PDQ summary on Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer for more information    .    )
Three types of standard treatment are used :
Surgery Surgery ( removing the cancer in an operation ) is used to treat childhood rhabdomyosarcoma    .
A type of surgery called wide local excision is often done    .
A wide local excision is the removal of tumor and some of the tissue around it , including the lymph nodes    .
A second surgery may be needed to remove all the cancer    .
Whether surgery is done and the type of surgery done depends on the following : - Where in the body the tumor started    .
- The effect the surgery will have on the way the child will look    .
- The effect the surgery will have on the child 's important body functions    .
- How the tumor responded to chemotherapy or radiation therapy that may have been given first    .
In most children with rhabdomyosarcoma , it is not possible to remove all of the tumor by surgery    .
Rhabdomyosarcoma can form in many different places in the body and the surgery will be different for each site    .
Surgery to treat rhabdomyosarcoma of the eye or genital areas is usually a biopsy    .
Chemotherapy , and sometimes radiation therapy , may be given before surgery to shrink large tumors    .
Even if the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery , patients will be given chemotherapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left    .
Radiation therapy may also be given    .
Treatment given after the surgery to lower the risk that the cancer will come back , is called adjuvant therapy    .
Radiation therapy Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high - energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or stop them from growing    .
There are two types of radiation therapy : - External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer    .
Certain ways of giving radiation therapy can help keep radiation from damaging nearby healthy tissue    .
These types of external radiation therapy include the following : - Conformal radiation therapy : Conformal radiation therapy is a type of external radiation therapy that uses a computer to make a 3 - dimensional ( 3 - D ) picture of the tumor and shapes the radiation beams to fit the tumor    .
This allows a high dose of radiation to reach the tumor and causes less damage to nearby healthy tissue    .
- Intensity - modulated radiation therapy ( IMRT ) : IMRT is a type of 3 - dimensional ( 3 - D ) radiation therapy that uses a computer to make pictures of the size and shape of the tumor    .
Thin beams of radiation of different intensities ( strengths ) are aimed at the tumor from many angles    .
- Volumetrical modulated arc therapy ( VMAT ) : VMAT is type of 3 - D radiation therapy that uses a computer to make pictures of the size and shape of the tumor    .
The radiation machine moves in a circle around the patient once during treatment and sends thin beams of radiation of different intensities ( strengths ) at the tumor    .
Treatment with VMAT is delivered faster than treatment with IMRT    .
- Stereotactic body radiation therapy : Stereotactic body radiation therapy is a type of external radiation therapy    .
Special equipment is used to place the patient in the same position for each radiation treatment    .
Once a day for several days , a radiation machine aims a larger than usual dose of radiation directly at the tumor    .
By having the patient in the same position for each treatment , there is less damage to nearby healthy tissue    .
This procedure is also called stereotactic external - beam radiation therapy and stereotaxic radiation therapy    .
- Proton beam radiation therapy : Proton - beam therapy is a type of high - energy , external radiation therapy    .
A radiation therapy machine aims streams of protons ( tiny , invisible , positively - charged particles ) at the cancer cells to kill them    .
This type of treatment causes less damage to nearby healthy tissue    .
- Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles , seeds , wires , or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer    .
It is used to treat cancer in areas such as the vagina , vulva , uterus , bladder , prostate , head , or neck    .
Internal radiation therapy is also called brachytherapy , internal radiation , implant radiation , or interstitial radiation therapy    .
The type and amount of radiation therapy and when it is given depends on the age of the child , the type of rhabdomyosarcoma , where in the body the tumor started , how much tumor remained after surgery , and whether there is tumor in the nearby lymph nodes    .
External radiation therapy is usually used to treat childhood rhabdomyosarcoma but in certain cases internal radiation therapy is used    .
Chemotherapy Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells , either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing    .
When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle , the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body ( systemic chemotherapy )    .
When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid , an organ , or a body cavity such as the abdomen , the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas ( regional chemotherapy )    .
Chemotherapy may also be given to shrink the tumor before surgery in order to save as much healthy tissue as possible    .
This is called neoadjuvant chemotherapy    .
Every child treated for rhabdomyosarcoma should receive systemic chemotherapy to decrease the chance the cancer will recur    .
The type of anticancer drug , dose , and the number of treatments given depends on whether the child has low - risk , intermediate - risk , or high - risk rhabdomyosarcoma    .
See Drugs Approved for Rhabdomyosarcoma for more information    .
Follow - up tests may be needed    .
Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated    .
Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working    .
Decisions about whether to continue , change , or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests    .
Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended    .
The results of these tests can show if your child 's condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred ( come back )    .
These tests are sometimes called follow - up tests or check - ups    .
Treatment Options for Childhood Rhabdomyosarcoma
Previously Untreated Childhood Rhabdomyosarcoma
The treatment of childhood rhabdomyosarcoma often includes surgery , radiation therapy , and chemotherapy    .
The order that these treatments are given depends on where in the body the tumor started , the size of the tumor , the type of tumor , and whether the tumor has spread to lymph nodes or other parts of the body    .

If the cancer has spread to the brain , spinal cord , or lungs , radiation therapy may also be given to the sites where the cancer has spread    .
The following treatment is being studied for metastatic rhabdomyosarcoma : - A clinical trial of immunotherapy ( vaccine therapy )    .
Check the list of NCI - supported cancer clinical trials that are now accepting patients with previously untreated childhood rhabdomyosarcoma    .
For more specific results , refine the search by using other search features , such as the location of the trial , the type of treatment , or the name of the drug    .
Talk with your child 's doctor about clinical trials that may be right for your child    .
General information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website    .
Recurrent Childhood Rhabdomyosarcoma
Treatment options for recurrent childhood rhabdomyosarcoma are based on many factors , including where in the body the cancer has come back , what type of treatment the child had before , and the needs of the child    .
Treatment of recurrent rhabdomyosarcoma may include one or more of the following : - Surgery    .    - Radiation therapy    .
- Chemotherapy    .    - A clinical trial of high - dose chemotherapy followed by stem cell transplant using the patient 's own stem cells    .
- A clinical trial of targeted therapy or immunotherapy ( sirolimus , lorvotuzumab , ipilimumab , nivolumab , or pembrolizumab )    .    - A clinical trial of targeted therapy with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( MK - 1775 ) and chemotherapy    .
Check the list of NCI - supported cancer clinical trials that are now accepting patients with recurrent childhood rhabdomyosarcoma    .
For more specific results , refine the search by using other search features , such as the location of the trial , the type of treatment , or the name of the drug    .
Talk with your child 's doctor about clinical trials that may be right for your child    .
General information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website    .
New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials    .
This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials    .
It may not mention every new treatment being studied    .
Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website    .
High - dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant High - dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant is a way of giving high doses of chemotherapy and replacing blood - forming cells destroyed by the cancer treatment    .
Stem cells ( immature blood cells ) are removed from the blood or bone marrow of the patient or a donor and are frozen and stored    .
After the chemotherapy is completed , the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion    .
These reinfused stem cells grow into ( and restore ) the body 's blood cells    .
Immunotherapy Immunotherapy is a treatment that uses the patients immune system to fight cancer    .
Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost , direct , or restore the bodys natural defenses against cancer    .
This type of cancer treatment is also called biologic therapy or biotherapy    .
There are different types of immunotherapy : - Immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy uses the body 's immune system to kill cancer cells    .
Two types of immune checkpoint inhibitors are being studied in the treatment of childhood rhabdomyosarcoma that has come back after treatment : - CTLA - 4 is a protein on the surface of T cells that helps keep the bodys immune responses in check    .
When CTLA - 4 attaches to another protein called B7 on a cancer cell , it stops the T cell from killing the cancer cell    .
CTLA - 4 inhibitors attach to CTLA - 4 and allow the T cells to kill cancer cells    .
Ipilimumab is a type of CTLA - 4 inhibitor    .
- PD - 1 is a protein on the surface of T cells that helps keep the bodys immune responses in check    .
When PD - 1 attaches to another protein called PDL - 1 on a cancer cell , it stops the T cell from killing the cancer cell    .
PD - 1 inhibitors attach to PDL - 1 and allow the T cells to kill cancer cells    .
Nivolumab and pembrolizumab are PD - 1 inhibitors    .
- Vaccine therapy is a type of immunotherapy being studied to treat metastatic rhabdomyosarcoma    .
Targeted therapy Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to attack cancer cells    .
Targeted therapies usually cause less harm to normal cells than chemotherapy or radiation do    .
There are different types of targeted therapy : - mTOR inhibitors stop the protein that helps cells divide and survive    .
Sirolimus is a type of mTOR inhibitor therapy being studied in the treatment of recurrent rhabdomyosarcoma    .
- Tyrosine kinase inhibitors are small - molecule drugs that go through the cell membrane and work inside cancer cells to block signals that cancer cells need to grow and divide    .
MK - 1775 is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor being studied in the treatment of recurrent rhabdomyosarcoma    .
- Antibody - drug conjugates are made up of a monoclonal antibody attached to a drug    .
The monoclonal antibody binds to specific proteins or receptors found on certain cells , including cancer cells    .
The drug enters these cells and kills them without harming other cells    .
Lorvotuzumab mertansine is an antibody - drug conjugate being studied in the treatment of recurrent rhabdomyosarcoma    .
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
For some patients , taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice    .
Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process    .
Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment    .
Many of today 's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials    .
Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment    .
Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future    .
Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments , they often answer important questions and help move research forward    .
Patients can enter clinical trials before , during , or after starting their cancer treatment    .
Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment    .
Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better    .
There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring ( coming back ) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment    .
Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country    .
See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials    .

What is (are) Childhood Soft Tissue Sarcoma ?

Key Points
- Childhood soft tissue sarcoma is a disease in which malignant ( cancer ) cells form in soft tissues of the body    .
- Soft tissue sarcoma occurs in children and adults    .
- Having certain diseases and inherited disorders can increase the risk of childhood soft tissue sarcoma    .    - The most common sign of childhood soft tissue sarcoma is a painless lump or swelling in soft tissues of the body    .
- Diagnostic tests are used to detect ( find ) and diagnose childhood soft tissue sarcoma    .    - If tests show there may be a soft tissue sarcoma , a biopsy is done    .
- There are many different types of soft tissue sarcomas    .
- Fat tissue tumors - Bone and cartilage tumors - Fibrous ( connective ) tissue tumors - Skeletal muscle tumors - Smooth muscle tumors - So - called fibrohistiocytic tumors - Peripheral nervous system tumors - Pericytic ( Perivascular ) Tumors - Tumors of unknown origin - Blood vessel tumors - Certain factors affect prognosis ( chance of recovery ) and treatment options    .
Childhood soft tissue sarcoma is a disease in which malignant ( cancer ) cells form in soft tissues of the body    .
Soft tissues of the body connect , support , and surround other body parts and organs    .
The soft tissues include the following : - Fat   .    - A mix of bone and cartilage    .
- Fibrous tissue    .
- Muscles    .    - Nerves    .    - Tendons ( bands of tissue that connect muscles to bones )    .
- Synovial tissues ( tissues around joints )    .
- Blood vessels    .
- Lymph vessels    .
Soft tissue sarcoma may be found anywhere in the body    .
In children , the tumors form most often in the arms , legs , or trunk ( chest and abdomen )    .
Soft tissue sarcoma occurs in children and adults    .
Soft tissue sarcoma in children may respond differently to treatment , and may have a better prognosis than soft tissue sarcoma in adults    .
( See the PDQ summary on Adult Soft Tissue Sarcoma Treatment for information on treatment in adults    .    )
There are many different types of soft tissue sarcomas    .
The cells of each type of sarcoma look different under a microscope    .
The soft tissue tumors are grouped based on the type of soft tissue cell where they first formed    .
This summary is about the following types of soft tissue sarcoma :
Fat tissue tumors - Liposarcoma    .
This is a rare cancer of the fat cells    .
Liposarcoma usually forms in the fat layer just under the skin    .
In children and adolescents , liposarcoma is often low grade ( likely to grow and spread slowly )    .
There are several different types of liposarcoma    .
Myxoid liposarcoma is usually low grade and responds well to treatment    .
The cells of myxoid liposarcoma have a certain genetic change called a translocation ( part of one chromosome switches places with part of another chromosome )    .
In order to diagnose myxoid liposarcoma , the tumor cells are checked for this genetic change    .
Pleomorphic liposarcoma is usually high grade ( likely to grow and spread quickly ) and is less likely to respond well to treatment    .
Bone and cartilage tumors
Bone and cartilage tumors are a mix of bone cells and cartilage cells    .
Bone and cartilage tumors include the following types : - Extraskeletal mesenchymal chondrosarcoma    .
This type of bone and cartilage tumor often affects young adults and occurs in the head and neck    .
- Extraskeletal osteosarcoma    .
This type of bone and cartilage tumor is very rare in children and adolescents    .
It is likely to come back after treatment and may spread to the lungs    .
Fibrous ( connective ) tissue tumors Fibrous ( connective ) tissue tumors include the following types : - Desmoid - type fibromatosis ( also called desmoid tumor or aggressive fibromatosis )    .
This fibrous tissue tumor is low grade ( likely to grow slowly )    .
It may come back in nearby tissues but usually does not spread to distant parts of the body    .
Rarely , the tumor may disappear without treatment    .
Desmoid tumors sometimes occur in children with changes in the adenomatous polyposis coli ( APC ) gene    .
Changes in this gene cause familial adenomatous polyposis ( FAP )    .
FAP is an inherited condition in which many polyps ( growths on mucous membranes ) form on the inside walls of the colon and rectum    .
Genetic counseling ( a discussion with a trained professional about inherited diseases and a possible need for gene testing ) may be needed    .
- Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans    .
This is a rare tumor of the deep layers of the skin found in children and adults    .
The cells of this tumor have a certain genetic change called a translocation ( part of one chromosome switches places with part of another chromosome )    .
In order to diagnose dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans , the tumor cells are checked for this genetic change    .
- Fibrosarcoma    .
There are two types of fibrosarcoma in children and adolescents : - Infantile fibrosarcoma ( also called congenital fibrosarcoma )    .
This type of fibrosarcoma is found in children aged 4 years and younger    .
It most often occurs in infants and may be seen in a prenatal ultrasound exam    .
This tumor is often large and fast growing , but rarely spreads to distant parts of the body    .
The cells of this tumor usually have a certain genetic change called a translocation ( part of one chromosome switches places with part of another chromosome )    .
In order to diagnose infantile fibrosarcoma , the tumor cells are checked for this genetic change    .
- Adult - type fibrosarcoma    .
This is the same type of fibrosarcoma found in adults    .
The cells of this tumor do not have the genetic change found in infantile fibrosarcoma    .
See the PDQ summary on Adult Soft Tissue Sarcoma Treatment for more information    .
- Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor    .
This is a fibrous tissue tumor that occurs in children and adolescents    .
It is likely to come back after treatment but rarely spreads to distant parts of the body    .
A certain genetic change has been found in about half of these tumors    .
- Low - grade fibromyxoid sarcoma    .
This is a slow - growing tumor that affects young and middle - aged adults    .
The cells of this tumor usually have a certain genetic change called a translocation ( part of one chromosome switches places with part of another chromosome )    .
In order to diagnose low - grade fibromyxoid sarcoma , the tumor cells are checked for this genetic change    .
The tumor may come back many years after treatment and spread to the lungs and the lining of the wall of the chest cavity    .
Lifelong follow - up is needed    .
- Myxofibrosarcoma    .
This is a rare fibrous tissue tumor that is found less often in children than in adults    .
- Sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma    .
This is a rare fibrous tissue tumor that can come back and spread to other places years after treatment    .
Long - term follow - up is needed    .
Skeletal muscle tumors Skeletal muscle is attached to bones and helps the body move    .
- Rhabdomyosarcoma    .
Rhabdomyosarcoma is the most common childhood soft tissue sarcoma in children 14 years and younger    .
See the PDQ summary on Childhood Rhabdomyosarcoma Treatment for more information    .
Smooth muscle tumors Smooth muscle lines the inside of blood vessels and hollow internal organs such as the stomach , intestines , bladder , and uterus    .
- Leiomyosarcoma    .
This smooth muscle tumor has been linked with Epstein - Barr virus in children who also have HIV disease or AIDS    .
Leiomyosarcoma may also form as a second cancer in survivors of inherited retinoblastoma , sometimes many years after the initial treatment for retinoblastoma    .
So - called fibrohistiocytic tumors - Plexiform fibrohistiocytic tumor    .
This is a rare tumor that usually affects children and young adults    .
The tumor usually starts as a painless growth on or just under the skin on the arm , hand , or wrist    .
It may rarely spread to nearby lymph nodes or to the lungs    .
Peripheral nervous system tumors Peripheral nervous system tumors include the following types : - Ectomesenchymoma    .
This is a rare , fast - growing tumor of the nerve sheath ( protective covering of nerves that are not part of the brain or spinal cord ) that occurs mainly in children    .
Ectomesenchymomas may form in the head and neck , abdomen , perineum , scrotum , arms , or legs    .
- Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor    .
This is a tumor that forms in the nerve sheath    .
Some children who have a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor have a rare genetic condition called neurofibromatosis type 1 ( NF1 )    .
This tumor may be low grade or high grade    .
- Malignant triton tumor    .
These are very rare , fast - growing tumors that occur most often in children with NF1    .
Pericytic ( Perivascular ) Tumors Pericytic tumors form in cells that wrap around blood vessels    .
Pericytic tumors include the following types : - Myopericytoma    .
Infantile hemangiopericytoma is a type of myopericytoma    .
Children younger than 1 year at the time of diagnosis may have a better prognosis    .
In patients older than 1 year , infantile hemangiopericytoma is more likely to spread to other parts of the body , including the lymph nodes and lungs    .
- Infantile myofibromatosis    .
Infantile myofibromatosis is another type of myopericytoma    .
It is a fibrous tumor that often forms in the first 2 years of life    .
There may be one nodule under the skin , usually in the head and neck area ( myofibroma ) , or nodules in several skin areas , muscle , and bone ( myofibromatosis )    .
These tumors may go away without treatment    .
Tumors of unknown origin Tumors of unknown origin ( the place where the tumor first formed is not known ) include the following types : - Alveolar soft part sarcoma    .
This is a rare tumor of the soft supporting tissue that connects and surrounds the organs and other tissues    .
It is most commonly found in the limbs but can occur in the tissues of the mouth , jaws , and face    .
It may grow slowly and may have spread to other parts of the body at the time of diagnosis    .
Alveolar soft part sarcoma may have a better prognosis when the tumor is 5 centimeters or smaller or when the tumor is completely removed by surgery    .
The cells of this tumor usually have a certain genetic change called a translocation ( part of one chromosome switches places with part of another chromosome )    .
In order to diagnose alveolar soft part sarcoma , the tumor cells are checked for this genetic change    .
- Clear cell sarcoma of soft tissue    .
This is a slow - growing soft tissue tumor that begins in a tendon ( tough , fibrous , cord - like tissue that connects muscle to bone or to another part of the body )    .
Clear cell sarcoma most commonly occurs in deep tissue of the foot , heel , and ankle    .
It may spread to nearby lymph nodes    .
The cells of this tumor usually have a certain genetic change called a translocation ( part of one chromosome switches places with part of another chromosome )    .
In order to diagnose clear cell sarcoma of soft tissue , the tumor cells are checked for this genetic change    .
- Desmoplastic small round cell tumor    .
This tumor most often forms in the abdomen , pelvis or tissues around the testes , but it may form in the kidney    .
Desmoplastic small round cell tumor may also spread to the lungs and other parts of the body    .
The cells of this tumor usually have a certain genetic change called a translocation ( part of one chromosome switches places with part of another chromosome )    .
In order to diagnose desmoplastic small round cell tumor , the tumor cells are checked for this genetic change    .
- Epithelioid sarcoma    .
This is a rare sarcoma that usually starts deep in soft tissue as a slow growing , firm lump and may spread to the lymph nodes    .
- Extrarenal ( extracranial ) rhabdoid tumor    .
This is a rare , fast - growing tumor of soft tissues such as the liver and peritoneum    .
It usually occurs in young children , including newborns , but it can occur in older children and adults    .
Rhabdoid tumors may be linked to a change in a tumor suppressor gene called SMARCB1    .
This type of gene makes a protein that helps control cell growth    .
Changes in the SMARCB1 gene may be inherited ( passed on from parents to offspring )    .
Genetic counseling ( a discussion with a trained professional about inherited diseases and a possible need for gene testing ) may be needed    .
- Extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma    .
This is a rare soft tissue sarcoma that may be found in children and adolescents    .
Over time , it tends to spread to other parts of the body , including the lymph nodes and lungs    .
The cells of this tumor usually have a genetic change , often a translocation ( part of one chromosome switches places with part of another chromosome )    .
In order to diagnose extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma , the tumor cells are checked for this genetic change    .
The tumor may come back many years after treatment    .
- Perivascular epithelioid cell tumors ( PEComas )    .
Benign ( not cancer ) PEComas may be found in children with an inherited condition called tuberous sclerosis    .
They occur in the stomach , intestines , lungs , female reproductive organs , and genitourinary organs    .
- Primitive neuroectodermal tumor ( PNET ) / extraskeletal Ewing tumor    .
See the PDQ summary on Ewing Sarcoma Treatment for information    .
- Synovial sarcoma    .
Synovial sarcoma is a common type of soft tissue sarcoma in children and adolescents    .
Synovial sarcoma usually forms in the tissues around the joints in the arms or legs , but may also form in the trunk , head , or neck    .
The cells of this tumor usually have a certain genetic change called a translocation ( part of one chromosome switches places with part of another chromosome )    .
Larger tumors have a greater risk of spreading to other parts of the body , including the lungs    .
Children younger than 10 years and those whose tumor is 5 centimeters or smaller have a better prognosis    .
- Undifferentiated / unclassified sarcoma    .
These tumors usually occur in the muscles that are attached to bones and that help the body move    .
- Undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma / malignant fibrous histiocytoma ( high - grade )    .
This type of soft tissue tumor may form in parts of the body where patients have received radiation therapy in the past , or as a second cancer in children with retinoblastoma    .
The tumor is usually found on the arms or legs and may spread to other parts of the body    .
See the PDQ summary on Osteosarcoma and Malignant Fibrous Histiocytoma of Bone Treatment for information about malignant fibrous histiocytoma of bone    .
Blood vessel tumors Blood vessel tumors include the following types : - Angiosarcoma of the soft tissue    .
Angiosarcoma of the soft tissue is a fast - growing tumor that forms in blood vessels or lymph vessels in any part of the body    .
Most angiosarcomas are in or just under the skin    .
Those in deeper soft tissue can form in the liver , spleen , and lung    .
They are very rare in children , who sometimes have more than one tumor in the skin or liver    .
Rarely , infantile hemangioma may become angiosarcoma of the soft tissue    .
( See the PDQ summary on Childhood Vascular Tumors Treatment for more information    .    ) - Epithelioid hemangioendothelioma    .
Epithelioid hemangioendotheliomas can occur in children , but are most common in adults between 30 and 50 years of age    .
They usually occur in the liver , lung , or bone    .
They may be either fast growing or slow growing    .
In about a third of cases , the tumor spreads to other parts of the body very quickly    .
( See the PDQ summary on Childhood Vascular Tumors Treatment for more information    .    )
See the following PDQ summaries for information about types of soft tissue sarcoma not included in this summary : - Childhood Rhabdomyosarcoma Treatment    .    - Ewing Sarcoma Treatment    .
- Unusual Cancers of Childhood Treatment ( gastrointestinal stromal tumors )    .
Who is at risk for Childhood Soft Tissue Sarcoma? ?

Having certain diseases and inherited disorders can increase the risk of childhood soft tissue sarcoma    .
Anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor    .
Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer ; not having risk factors doesnt mean that you will not get cancer    .
Talk with your childs doctor if you think your child may be at risk    .
Risk factors for childhood soft tissue sarcoma include having the following inherited disorders : - Li-Fraumeni syndrome    .
- Familial adenomatous polyposis ( FAP )    .
- Retinoblastoma 1 gene changes    .
- Neurofibromatosis type 1 ( NF1 )    .    - Werner syndrome    .
Other risk factors include the following : - Past treatment with radiation therapy    .
- Having AIDS ( acquired immune deficiency syndrome ) and Epstein - Barr virus infection at the same time    .
What are the symptoms of Childhood Soft Tissue Sarcoma ?

The most common sign of childhood soft tissue sarcoma is a painless lump or swelling in soft tissues of the body    .
A sarcoma may appear as a painless lump under the skin , often on an arm , a leg , or the trunk    .
There may be no other signs or symptoms at first    .
As the sarcoma gets bigger and presses on nearby organs , nerves , muscles , or blood vessels , it may cause signs or symptoms , such as pain or weakness    .
Other conditions may cause the same signs and symptoms    .
Check with your childs doctor if your child has any of these problems    .
How to diagnose Childhood Soft Tissue Sarcoma ?

Diagnostic tests are used to detect ( find ) and diagnose childhood soft tissue sarcoma    .
The following tests and procedures may be used : - Physical exam and history :
An exam of the body to check general signs of health , including checking for signs of disease , such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual    .
A history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken    .
- X-rays :
An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body onto film , making pictures of areas inside the body    .
- MRI ( magnetic resonance imaging ) : A procedure that uses a magnet , radio waves , and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas of the body , such as the chest , abdomen , arms , or legs    .
This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging ( NMRI )    .
- CT scan ( CAT scan ) : A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body , such as the chest or abdomen , taken from different angles    .
The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine    .
A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly    .
This procedure is also called computed tomography , computerized tomography , or computerized axial tomography    .
- Ultrasound exam :
A procedure in which high - energy sound waves ( ultrasound ) are bounced off internal tissues or organs and make echoes    .
The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram    .
The picture can be printed to be looked at later    .
- If tests show there may be a soft tissue sarcoma , a biopsy is done    .
One of the following types of biopsies is usually used : - Core needle biopsy :
The removal of tissue using a wide needle    .
This procedure may be guided using ultrasound , CT scan , or MRI    .
- Incisional biopsy :
The removal of part of a lump or a sample of tissue    .
- Excisional biopsy :
The removal of an entire lump or area of tissue that doesnt look normal    .
A pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells    .
An excisional biopsy may be used to completely remove smaller tumors that are near the surface of the skin    .
This type of biopsy is rarely used because cancer cells may remain after the biopsy    .
If cancer cells remain , the cancer may come back or it may spread to other parts of the body    .
An MRI of the tumor is done before the excisional biopsy    .
This is done to show where the original tumor is and may be used to guide future surgery or radiation therapy    .
The placement of needles or incisions for the biopsy can affect the success of later surgery to remove the tumor    .
If possible , the surgeon who will remove any tumor that is found should be involved in planning the biopsy    .
In order to plan the best treatment , the sample of tissue removed during the biopsy must be large enough to find out the type of soft tissue sarcoma and do other laboratory tests    .
Tissue samples will be taken from the primary tumor , lymph nodes , and other areas that may have cancer cells    .
A pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells and to find out the type and grade of the tumor    .
The grade of a tumor depends on how abnormal the cancer cells look under a microscope and how quickly the cells are dividing    .
High - grade and mid-grade tumors usually grow and spread more quickly than low - grade tumors    .
Because soft tissue sarcoma can be hard to diagnose , the tissue sample should be checked by a pathologist who has experience in diagnosing soft tissue sarcoma    .
One or more of the following laboratory tests may be done to study the tissue samples : - Molecular test :
A laboratory test to check for certain genes , proteins , or other molecules in a sample of tissue , blood , or other body fluid    .
A molecular test may be done with other procedures , such as biopsies , to help diagnose some types of cancer    .
Molecular tests check for certain gene or chromosome changes that occur in some soft tissue sarcomas    .
- Reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction ( RTPCR ) test : A laboratory test in which cells in a sample of tissue are studied using chemicals to look for changes in the expression of certain genes    .
When genes are expressed they make specific proteins that are needed for the structure , function , and monitoring of the bodys tissues and organs    .
This test is done in order to identify the type of tumor    .
- Cytogenetic analysis :
A laboratory test in which cells in a sample of bone marrow , blood , amniotic fluid , tumor or other tissue is viewed under a microscope to look for changes in the chromosomes    .
Fluorescence in situ hybridization ( FISH ) is a type of cytogenetic analysis    .
- Immunocytochemistry :
A test that uses antibodies to check for certain antigens ( markers ) in a sample of cells    .
The antibody is usually linked to an enzyme or fluorescent dye that causes the cells that have that marker to become visible under a microscope    .
This type of test may be used to tell the difference between different types of soft tissue sarcoma    .
What is the outlook for Childhood Soft Tissue Sarcoma ?

Certain factors affect prognosis ( chance of recovery ) and treatment options    .
The prognosis ( chance of recovery ) and treatment options depend on the following : - The part of the body where the tumor first formed    .
- The size and grade of the tumor    .    - The type of soft tissue sarcoma    .    - How deep the tumor is under the skin    .
- Whether the tumor has spread to other places in the body    .
- The amount of tumor remaining after surgery to remove it    .
- Whether radiation therapy was used to treat the tumor    .
- The age and gender of the patient    .
- Whether the cancer has just been diagnosed or has recurred ( come back )    .
What are the stages of Childhood Soft Tissue Sarcoma ?

Key Points
- After childhood soft tissue sarcoma has been diagnosed , tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread to other parts of the body    .
- There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body    .
- Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body    .
After childhood soft tissue sarcoma has been diagnosed , tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread to other parts of the body    .
The process used to find out if cancer has spread within the soft tissue or to other parts of the body is called staging    .
There is no standard staging system for childhood soft tissue sarcoma    .
In order to plan treatment , it is important to know the type of soft tissue sarcoma , whether the tumor can be removed by surgery , and whether cancer has spread to other parts of the body    .
The following procedures may be used to find out if cancer has spread : - Sentinel lymph node biopsy : A sentinel lymph node biopsy is done to check if cancer has spread to the lymph nodes    .
The sentinel lymph node is the first lymph node to receive lymphatic drainage from a tumor    .
It is the first lymph node the cancer is likely to spread to from the tumor    .
A small amount of a radioactive substance and / or blue dye is injected near the tumor    .
The radioactive substance or dye flows through the lymph ducts to the lymph nodes    .
The first lymph node to receive the substance or dye is removed    .
A pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells    .
If cancer cells are not found , it may not be necessary to remove more lymph nodes    .
This procedure is used for epithelioid and clear cell sarcoma    .
- PET scan : A PET scan is a procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body    .
A small amount of radioactive glucose ( sugar ) is injected into a vein    .
The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body    .
Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do    .
This procedure is also called positron emission tomography ( PET ) scan    .
- PET -CT scan :
A procedure that combines the pictures from a PET scan and a computed tomography ( CT ) scan    .
The PET and CT scans are done at the same time on the same machine    .
The pictures from both scans are combined to make a more detailed picture than either test would make by itself    .
There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body    .
Cancer can spread through tissue , the lymph system , and the blood : - Tissue    .
The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas    .
- Lymph system    .
The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system    .
The cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body    .
- Blood    .
The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood    .
The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body    .
Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body    .
When cancer spreads to another part of the body , it is called metastasis    .
Cancer cells break away from where they began ( the primary tumor ) and travel through the lymph system or blood    .
- Lymph system    .
The cancer gets into the lymph system , travels through the lymph vessels , and forms a tumor ( metastatic tumor ) in another part of the body    .
- Blood    .
The cancer gets into the blood , travels through the blood vessels , and forms a tumor ( metastatic tumor ) in another part of the body    .
The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor    .
For example , if soft tissue sarcoma spreads to the lung , the cancer cells in the lung are soft tissue sarcoma cells    .
The disease is metastatic soft tissue sarcoma , not lung cancer    .
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Childhood Soft Tissue Sarcoma ?

New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials    .
This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials    .
It may not mention every new treatment being studied    .
Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website    .
Gene therapy
Gene therapy is being studied for childhood synovial sarcoma that has recurred , spread , or can not be removed by surgery    .

Some of the patient 's T cells ( a type of white blood cell ) are removed and the genes in the cells are changed in a laboratory ( genetically engineered ) so that they will attack specific cancer cells    .
They are then given back to the patient by infusion    .
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
For some patients , taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice    .
Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process    .
Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment    .
Many of today 's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials    .
Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment    .
Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future    .
Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments , they often answer important questions and help move research forward    .
Patients can enter clinical trials before , during , or after starting their cancer treatment    .
Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment    .
Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better    .
There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring ( coming back ) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment    .
Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country    .
See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials    .
These have been retrieved from NCI 's listing of clinical trials    .

There are different types of treatment for patients with childhood soft tissue sarcoma    .
Different types of treatments are available for patients with childhood soft tissue sarcoma    .
Some treatments are standard ( the currently used treatment ) , and some are being tested in clinical trials    .
A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer    .
When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment , the new treatment may become the standard treatment    .
Because cancer in children is rare , taking part in a clinical trial should be considered    .
Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment    .
Children with childhood soft tissue sarcoma should have their treatment planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating cancer in children    .
Treatment will be overseen by a pediatric oncologist , a doctor who specializes in treating children with cancer    .
The pediatric oncologist works with other health care providers who are experts in treating children with soft tissue sarcoma and who specialize in certain areas of medicine    .
These may include a pediatric surgeon with special training in the removal of soft tissue sarcomas    .
The following specialists may also be included : - Pediatrician    .    - Radiation oncologist    .
- Pediatric hematologist    .
- Pediatric nurse specialist    .
- Rehabilitation specialist    .
- Psychologist    .
- Social worker    .
- Child - life specialist    .
Treatment for childhood soft tissue sarcoma may cause side effects    .
For information about side effects that begin during treatment for cancer , see our Side Effects page    .
Side effects from cancer treatment that begin after treatment and continue for months or years are called late effects    .
Late effects of cancer treatment may include : - Physical problems    .
- Changes in mood , feelings , thinking , learning , or memory    .
- Second cancers ( new types of cancer )    .
Some late effects may be treated or controlled    .
It is important to talk with your child 's doctors about the effects cancer treatment can have on your child    .
( See the PDQ summary on Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer for more information    .    )
Eight types of standard treatment are used :
Surgery Surgery to completely remove the soft tissue sarcoma is done when possible    .
If the tumor is very large , radiation therapy or chemotherapy may be given first , to make the tumor smaller and decrease the amount of tissue that needs to be removed during surgery    .
This is called neoadjuvant therapy    .
The following types of surgery may be used : - Wide local excision : Removal of the tumor along with some normal tissue around it    .
- Amputation : Surgery to remove all or part of the limb or appendage with cancer , such as the arm or hand    .
- Lymphadenectomy : Removal of the lymph nodes with cancer    .    - Mohs surgery : A surgical procedure used to treat cancer in the skin    .
Individual layers of cancer tissue are removed and checked under a microscope one at a time until all cancer tissue has been removed    .
This type of surgery is used to treat dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans    .
It is also called Mohs micrographic surgery    .
- Hepatectomy : Surgery to remove all or part of the liver    .
A second surgery may be needed to : - Remove any remaining cancer cells    .
- Check the area around where the tumor was removed for cancer cells and then remove more tissue if needed    .
If cancer is in the liver , a hepatectomy and liver transplant may be done ( the liver is removed and replaced with a healthy one from a donor )    .
Even if the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery , some patients may be given radiation therapy or chemotherapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left    .
Treatment given after the surgery , to lower the risk that the cancer will come back , is called adjuvant therapy    .
Radiation therapy Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high - energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing    .
There are two types of radiation therapy : - External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer    .
Certain ways of giving radiation therapy can help keep radiation from damaging nearby healthy tissue    .
This type of radiation therapy may include the following : - Stereotactic body radiation therapy : Stereotactic body radiation therapy is a type of external radiation therapy    .
Special equipment is used to place the patient in the same position for each radiation treatment    .
Once a day for several days , a radiation machine aims a larger than usual dose of radiation directly at the tumor    .
By having the patient in the same position for each treatment , there is less damage to nearby healthy tissue    .
This procedure is also called stereotactic external - beam radiation therapy and stereotaxic radiation therapy    .
- Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles , seeds , wires , or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer    .
The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated and whether the tumor was completely removed by surgery    .
External and internal radiation therapy are used to treat childhood soft tissue sarcoma    .
Chemotherapy Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells , either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing    .
When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle , the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body ( systemic chemotherapy )    .
When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid , an organ , or a body cavity such as the abdomen , the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas ( regional chemotherapy )    .
Combination chemotherapy is the use of more than one anticancer drug    .
The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type of cancer being treated    .
Most types of soft tissue sarcoma do not respond to treatment with chemotherapy    .
See Drugs Approved for Soft Tissue Sarcoma for more information    .
Observation Observation is closely monitoring a patients condition without giving any treatment until signs or symptoms appear or change    .
Observation may be done when : - Complete removal of the tumor is not possible    .
- No other treatments are available    .
- The tumor is not likely to damage any vital organs    .
Hormone therapy Hormone therapy is a cancer treatment that removes hormones or blocks their action and stops cancer cells from growing    .
Hormones are substances made by glands in the body and circulated in the bloodstream    .
Some hormones can cause certain cancers to grow    .
If tests show that the cancer cells have places where hormones can attach ( receptors ) , drugs , surgery , or radiation therapy is used to reduce the production of hormones or block them from working    .
Antiestrogens ( drugs that block estrogen ) , such as tamoxifen , may be used to treat desmoid - type fibromatosis    .
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) are drugs ( such as aspirin , ibuprofen , and naproxen ) that are commonly used to decrease fever , swelling , pain , and redness    .
In the treatment of desmoid - type fibromatosis , an NSAID called sulindac may be used to help block the growth of cancer cells    .
Targeted therapy Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to attack cancer cells    .
Targeted therapies usually cause less harm to normal cells than chemotherapy or radiation do    .
Kinase inhibitors are a type of targeted therapy that block an enzyme called kinase ( a type of protein )    .
There are different types of kinases in the body that have different actions    .
- ALK inhibitors may stop the cancer from growing and spreading : - Crizotinib may be used to treat inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor    .
- Tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( TKIs ) block signals needed for tumors to grow : - Imatinib is used to treat dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans    .
- Pazopanib may be used to treat recurrent and progressive soft tissue sarcoma    .
It is being studied for many types of newly diagnosed soft tissue sarcoma    .
- Sorafenib may be used to treat desmoid - type fibromatosis    .
New types of tyrosine kinase inhibitors are being studied such as LOXO - 101 and entrectinib for infantile fibrosarcoma    .
Other types of targeted therapy are being studied in clinical trials , including the following : - mTOR inhibitors are a type of targeted therapy that stops the protein that helps cells divide and survive    .
mTOR inhibitors are being studied to treat perivascular epithelioid cell tumors ( PEComas ) and epithelioid hemangioendothelioma    .
Sirolimus is a type of mTOR inhibitor therapy    .
- Angiogenesis inhibitors are a type of targeted therapy that prevent the growth of new blood vessels needed for tumors to grow    .
Angiogenesis inhibitors , such as cediranib , sunitinib , and thalidomide are being studied to treat alveolar soft part sarcoma and epithelioid hemangioendothelioma    .
Bevacizumab is being studied for blood vessel tumors    .
- Histone methyltransferase ( HMT ) inhibitors are targeted therapy drugs that work inside cancer cells and block signals needed for tumors to grow    .
HMT inhibitors are being studied for the treatment of epithelioid sarcoma , malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor , extrarenal ( extracranial ) rhabdoid tumor , extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma , and synovial sarcoma    .
- Heat - shock protein inhibitors block certain proteins that protect tumor cells and help them grow    .
Ganetespib is a heat shock protein inhibitor being studied in combination with the mTOR inhibitor sirolimus for malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors that cannot be removed by surgery    .
- Antibody - drug conjugates are made up of a monoclonal antibody attached to a drug    .
The monoclonal antibody binds to specific proteins or receptors found on certain cells , including cancer cells    .
The drug enters these cells and kills them without harming other cells    .
Lorvotuzumab mertansine is an antibody - drug conjugate being studied for the treatment of rhabdomyosarcoma , malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor , and synovial sarcoma    .
See Drugs Approved for Soft Tissue Sarcoma for more information    .
Immunotherapy Immunotherapy is a treatment that uses the patients immune system to fight disease    .
Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost , direct , or restore the bodys natural defenses against disease    .
Interferon is a type of immunotherapy used to treat epithelioid hemangioendothelioma    .
It interferes with the division of tumor cells and can slow tumor growth    .
Follow - up tests may be needed    .
Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated    .
Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working    .
Decisions about whether to continue , change , or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests    .
Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended    .
The results of these tests can show if your child 's condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred ( come back )    .
These tests are sometimes called follow - up tests or check - ups    .

What is (are) Childhood Vascular Tumors ?

Key Points
- Childhood vascular tumors form from cells that make blood vessels or lymph vessels    .
- Tests are used to detect ( find ) and diagnose childhood vascular tumors    .
- Childhood vascular tumors may be classified into four groups    .
- Benign tumors - Intermediate ( locally aggressive ) tumors - Intermediate ( rarely metastasizing ) tumors - Malignant tumors
Childhood vascular tumors form from cells that make blood vessels or lymph vessels    .
Vascular tumors can form from abnormal blood vessel or lymph vessel cells anywhere in the body    .
They may be benign ( not cancer ) or malignant ( cancer )    .
There are many types of vascular tumors    .
The most common type of childhood vascular tumor is hemangioma , which is a benign tumor that usually goes away on its own    .
Because malignant vascular tumors are rare in children , there is not a lot of information about what treatment works best    .
Childhood vascular tumors may be classified into four groups    .
Benign tumors Benign tumors are not cancer    .
This summary has information about the following benign vascular tumors : - Infantile hemangioma    .    - Congenital hemangioma    .    - Benign vascular tumors of the liver    .
- Spindle cell hemangioma    .    - Epithelioid hemangioma    .    - Pyogenic granuloma ( lobular capillary hemangioma )    .
- Angiofibroma    .    - Juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma    .
Intermediate ( locally aggressive ) tumors Intermediate tumors that are locally aggressive often spread to the area around the tumor    .
This summary has information about the following locally aggressive vascular tumors : - Kaposiform hemangioendothelioma and tufted angioma    .
Intermediate ( rarely metastasizing ) tumors Intermediate ( rarely metastasizing ) tumors sometimes spread to other parts of the body    .
This summary has information about the following vascular tumors that rarely metastasize : - Retiform hemangioendothelioma    .    - Papillary intralymphatic angioendothelioma    .
- Composite hemangioendothelioma    .    - Kaposi sarcoma    .
Malignant tumors Malignant tumors are cancer    .
This summary has information about the following malignant vascular tumors : - Epithelioid hemangioendothelioma    .    - Angiosarcoma of soft tissue    .
Benign Tumors
Infantile Hemangioma
Infantile hemangiomas are the most common type of benign vascular tumor in children    .
An infantile hemangioma may also be called a &quot ; strawberry mark    .
&quot ; Immature cells that are meant to form blood vessels form a tumor instead    .
These tumors are not usually seen at birth but appear when the infant is 3 to 6 weeks old    .
Most hemangiomas get bigger for about 5 months , then stop growing and slowly fade away completely during the next several years    .
It is rare for them to come back    .
Hemangiomas may be on the skin , in the tissue below the skin , and / or in an organ    .
They are usually on the head and neck but can be anywhere on or in the body    .
Hemangiomas may appear as a single lesion , one or more lesions spread over a larger area of the body , or multiple lesions in more than one part of the body    .
Lesions that are spread over a larger area of the body or multiple lesions are more likely to cause problems    .
Risk Factors
Anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor    .
Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get the disease ; not having risk factors doesnt mean that you will not get the disease    .
Talk with your child 's doctor if you think your child may be at risk    .
Infantile hemangiomas are more common in the following : - Girls    .    - Whites    .    - Premature babies    .    - Twins , triplets , or other multiple births    .
- Babies of mothers who are older at time of the pregnancy or who have problems with the placenta during pregnancy    .
Other risk factors for infantile hemangiomas include the following : - Having certain syndromes    .
- PHACE syndrome : A syndrome in which the hemangioma spreads across a large area of the body ( usually the head or face )    .
Other health problems involving the large blood vessels , heart , eyes , and / or brain may also occur    .
- LUMBAR / PELVIS /SACRAL
syndrome : A syndrome in which the hemangioma spreads across a large area of the lower back    .
Other health problems that affect the urinary system , genitals , rectum , anus , brain , spinal cord , and nerve function may also occur    .
Having more than one hemangioma or an airway hemangioma increases the risk of having other health problems    .
- Multiple hemangiomas : Having more than five hemangiomas on the skin is a sign that there may be hemangiomas in an organ , most commonly the liver    .
Heart , muscle , and thyroid gland problems can also occur    .
- Airway hemangiomas : Hemangiomas in the airway usually occur along with a large , beard - shaped area of hemangioma on the face ( from the ears , around the mouth , lower chin , and front of neck )    .
It is important for airway hemangiomas to be treated before the child has trouble breathing    .

Signs and Symptoms Infantile hemangiomas may cause any of the following signs and symptoms    .
Check with your childs doctor if your child has any of the following : - Skin lesions :
An area of spidery veins or lightened or discolored skin may appear before the hemangioma does    .
Hemangiomas occur as firm , warm , bright red - blue lesions on the skin    .
Lesions that form ulcers are also painful    .
Later , as the hemangiomas go away , they begin fading in the center before flattening and losing color    .
- Lesions below the skin : Lesions that grow under the skin in the fat may appear blue or purple    .
If the lesions are deep enough under the skin surface , they may not be seen    .
- Lesions in an organ :
There may be no signs that hemangiomas have formed on an organ    .
Although most infantile hemangiomas are nothing to worry about , if your child develops any lumps or red or blue marks on the skin check with your child 's doctor    .
He or she can recommend a specialist if needed    .
Diagnostic Tests
A physical exam and history are usually all that are needed to diagnose infantile hemangiomas    .
If there is something about the tumor that looks unusual , a biopsy may be done    .
If the hemangioma is deeper inside the body with no change to the skin , or the lesions are spread across a large area of the body , an ultrasound or MRI may be done    .
See the General Information section for a description of these tests and procedures    .
If the hemangiomas are part of a syndrome , more tests may be done such as an echocardiogram , magnetic resonance angiogram , and eye exam    .
Treatment Most hemangiomas fade and shrink without treatment    .
If the hemangioma is large or causing other health problems , treatment may include the following : - Propranolol or other beta - blocker therapy    .
- Steroid therapy , before beta - blocker therapy is begun or when beta - blockers cannot be used    .
- Pulsed dye laser surgery , for hemangiomas that have ulcers or have not gone away    .
- Surgery ( excision ) for hemangiomas that have ulcers , cause vision problems , or have not gone away    .
- Topical beta - blocker therapy for hemangiomas that are in one area of the skin    .
- Combined therapy , such as propranolol and steroid therapy or propranolol and topical beta - blocker therapy    .
Congenital Hemangioma
Congenital hemangioma is a benign vascular tumor that begins forming before birth and is fully formed when the baby is born    .
They 're usually on the skin but can be in another organ    .
There are three types of congenital hemangiomas : - Rapidly Involuting Congenital Hemangioma :
These tumors go away on their own 12 to 15 months after birth    .
They can form ulcers , bleed , and cause temporary heart and blood clotting problems    .
The skin may look a little different even after the hemangiomas go away    .
- Partial Involuting Congenital Hemangioma :
These tumors do not go away completely    .
- Non-Involuting Congenital Hemangioma :
These tumors never go away on their own    .
Diagnostic Tests See the General Information section for a description of tests and procedures used to diagnose congenital hemangioma    .
Treatment Treatment of rapidly involuting congenital hemangioma and partial involuting congenital hemangioma may include the following : - Observation only    .
Treatment of non-involuting congenital hemangioma may include the following : - Surgery to remove the tumor depending on where it is and whether it is causing symptoms    .
Benign Vascular Tumors of the Liver
Benign vascular tumors of the liver may be focal ( a single lesion in one area of the liver ) , multifocal ( multiple lesions in one area of the liver ) , or diffuse ( multiple lesions in more than one area of the liver )    .
The liver has many functions , including filtering blood and making proteins needed for blood clotting    .
Sometimes , blood that normally flows through the liver is blocked or slowed by the tumor    .
This sends blood directly to the heart without going through the liver and is called a liver shunt    .
This can cause heart failure and problems with blood clotting    .
Focal Tumors
Focal tumors are usually rapidly involuting congenital hemangiomas or non-involuting congenital hemangiomas    .
 कंजेनिटल हेमांगीओमास या नॉन  इनवॉल्यूटिंग कंजेनिटल हेमांगीओमास होते हैं।
Diagnostic Tests
See the General Information section for a description of tests and procedures used to diagnose focal benign vascular tumors    .
Treatment Treatment of focal tumors of the liver depends on whether symptoms occur and may include the following : - Observation    .    - Drugs to manage symptoms , including heart failure and blood clotting problems    .
- Embolization of the liver to manage symptoms , including heart failure    .
Multifocal and Diffuse Tumors Multifocal and diffuse tumors of the liver are usually infantile hemangiomas    .
Diffuse tumors of the liver can cause serious effects , including problems with the thyroid gland and heart    .
The liver can enlarge , press on other organs , and cause more symptoms    .
Diagnostic Tests
See the General Information section for a description of tests and procedures used to diagnose multifocal or diffuse benign vascular tumors    .
Treatment Treatment of multifocal and diffuse liver tumors may include the following : - Observation for multifocal tumors of the liver that do not cause symptoms    .
- Beta - blocker therapy ( propranolol )    .
- Chemotherapy    .    - Steroid therapy    .    - Total hepatectomy and liver transplant , when the tumors do not respond to drug therapy    .
This is only done when the tumors have spread widely in the liver and more than one organ has failed    .
If a vascular tumor of the liver does not respond to standard treatments , a biopsy may be done to see if the tumor has become malignant    .
Spindle Cell Hemangioma
Spindle cell hemangiomas contain cells called spindle cells    .
Under a microscope , spindle cells look long and slender    .
Risk Factors
Anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor    .
Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get the disease ; not having risk factors doesnt mean that you will not get the disease    .
Talk with your child 's doctor if you think your child may be at risk    .
Spindle cell hemangiomas are likely to occur in children with the following syndromes : - Maffucci syndrome , which affects cartilage and skin    .
- Klippel - Trenaunay syndrome , which affects blood vessels , soft tissues , and bones    .
Signs Spindle cell hemangiomas appear on or under the skin    .
They are painful red - brown or bluish lesions that usually appear on the arms or legs    .
They can begin as one lesion and develop into more lesions over years    .
Diagnostic Tests
See the General Information section for a description of tests and procedures used to diagnose spindle cell hemangioma    .
Treatment
There is no standard treatment for spindle cell hemangiomas    .
Treatment may include the following : - Surgery to remove the tumor    .
Spindle cell hemangiomas may come back after surgery    .
Epithelioid Hemangioma
Epithelioid hemangiomas usually form on or in the skin , especially the head , but can occur in other areas , such as bone    .
Signs and Symptoms Epithelioid hemangiomas are sometimes caused by injury    .
On the skin , they may appear as firm pink to red bumps and may be itchy    .
Epithelioid hemangioma of the bone may cause swelling , pain , and weakened bone in the affected area    .
Diagnostic Tests See the General Information section for a description of tests and procedures used to diagnose epithelioid hemangioma    .
Treatment
There is no standard treatment for epithelioid hemangiomas    .
Treatment may include the following : - Surgery ( curettage or resection )    .
- Sclerotherapy    .    - Radiation therapy in rare cases    .
Epithelioid hemangiomas often come back after treatment    .
Pyogenic Granuloma
Pyogenic granuloma is also called lobular capillary hemangioma    .
It is most common in older children and young adults but may occur at any age    .
The lesions are sometimes caused by injury or from the use of certain medicines , including birth control pills and retinoids    .
They may also form for no known reason inside capillaries ( the smallest blood vessels ) or other places on the body    .
Usually there is only one lesion , but sometimes multiple lesions occur in the same area or the lesions may spread to other areas of the body    .
Signs Pyogenic granulomas are raised , bright red lesions that may be small or large and smooth or bumpy    .
They grow quickly over weeks to months and may bleed a lot    .
Diagnostic Tests
See the General Information section for a description of tests and procedures used to diagnose pyogenic granuloma    .
Treatment Some pyogenic granulomas go away without treatment    .
Other pyogenic granulomas need treatment that may include the following : - Surgery ( excision or curettage ) to remove the lesion    .
- Laser photocoagulation    .
Pyogenic granulomas often come back after treatment    .
Angiofibroma
Angiofibromas are rare    .
They are benign skin lesions that usually occur with a condition called tuberous sclerosis ( an inherited disorder that causes skin lesions , seizures , and mental disabilities )    .
Signs Angiofibromas appear as red bumps on the face    .
Diagnostic Tests See the General Information section for a description of tests and procedures used to diagnose angiofibroma    .
Treatment Treatment of angiofibromas may include the following : - Surgery ( excision ) to remove the tumor    .
- Laser therapy    .
- Targeted therapy ( sirolimus )    .
Juvenile Nasopharyngeal Angiofibroma
Juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibromas are benign tumors but they can invade nearby tissue    .
They begin in the nasal cavity and may spread to the nasopharynx , the paranasal sinuses , the bone around the eyes , and sometimes to the brain    .
Diagnostic Tests
See the General Information section for a description of tests and procedures used to diagnose juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma    .
Treatment Treatment of juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibromas may include the following : - Surgery ( excision ) to remove the tumor    .
- Radiation therapy    .
- Chemotherapy    .    - Immunotherapy ( interferon )    .
- Targeted therapy ( sirolimus )    .
Intermediate Tumors that Spread Locally
Kaposiform Hemangioendothelioma and Tufted Angioma
Kaposiform hemangioendotheliomas and tufted angiomas are blood vessel tumors that occur in infants or during early childhood    .
These tumors can cause Kasabach - Merritt phenomenon , a condition in which the blood is not able to clot and serious bleeding may occur    .
In Kasabach - Merritt phenomenon the tumor traps and destroys platelets ( blood - clotting cells )    .
Then there are n't enough platelets in the blood when needed to stop bleeding    .
This type of vascular tumor is not related to Kaposi sarcoma    .
Signs and Symptoms Kaposiform hemangioendotheliomas and tufted angiomas usually occur on the skin of the arms and legs , but may also form in deeper tissues , such as muscle or bone    .
Signs and symptoms may include the following : - Firm , painful areas of skin that look bruised    .
- Purple or brownish - red areas of skin    .
- Easy bruising    .
- Bleeding more than the usual amount from mucous membranes , wounds , and other tissues    .
- Anemia ( weakness , feeling tired , or looking pale )    .
Diagnostic Tests
See the General Information section for a description of tests and procedures used to diagnose kaposiform hemangioendothelioma    .
If a physical exam and MRI clearly show the tumor is a kaposiform hemangioendothelioma or a tufted angioma , a biopsy may not be needed    .
A biopsy is not always done because serious bleeding can occur    .
Treatment Treatment of kaposiform hemangioendotheliomas and tufted angiomas depends on the child 's symptoms    .
Infection , delay in treatment , and surgery can cause bleeding that is life - threatening    .
Kaposiform hemangioendotheliomas and tufted angiomas are best treated by a vascular anomaly specialist    .
Treatment and supportive care to manage bleeding may include the following : - Steroid therapy which may be followed by chemotherapy    .
- Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAID ) , such as aspirin    .
- Immunotherapy ( interferon )    .
- Antifibrinolytic therapy to improve blood clotting    .
- Chemotherapy with one or more anticancer drugs    .
- Beta - blocker therapy ( propranolol )    .
- Surgery ( excision ) to remove the tumor , with or without embolization    .
- Targeted therapy ( sirolimus )    .    - A clinical trial of targeted therapy ( sirolimus ) and steroid therapy    .
Even with treatment , these tumors do not fully go away and can come back    .
Long - term effects include chronic pain , heart failure , bone problems , and lymphedema ( the build up of lymph fluid in tissues )    .
Intermediate Tumors that Rarely Spread
Retiform Hemangioendothelioma
Retiform hemangioendotheliomas are slow growing , flat tumors that occur in young adults and sometimes children    .
These tumors usually occur on or under the skin of the arms , legs , and trunk    .
These tumors often come back after treatment , but they usually do not spread to other parts of the body    .
Diagnostic Tests See the General Information section for a description of tests and procedures used to diagnose retiform hemangioendothelioma    .
Treatment Treatment of retiform hemangioendotheliomas may include the following : - Surgery ( excision ) to remove the tumor    .
Follow up will include monitoring to see if the tumor comes back    .
- Radiation therapy and chemotherapy when surgery cannot be done or when the tumor has come back    .
Papillary Intralymphatic Angioendothelioma
Papillary intralymphatic angioendotheliomas are also called Dabska tumors    .
These tumors form in or under the skin anywhere on the body    .
The tumors contain channels that look like lymph vessels    .
Lymph nodes are sometimes affected    .
Signs Papillary intralymphatic angioendotheliomas may appear as firm , raised , purplish bumps , which may be small or large    .
These tumors grow slowly over time    .
Diagnostic Tests
See the General Information section for a description of tests and procedures used to diagnose papillary intralymphatic angioendothelioma    .
Treatment Treatment of papillary intralymphatic angioendotheliomas may include the following : - Surgery ( excision ) to remove the tumor    .
Composite Hemangioendothelioma
Composite hemangioendotheliomas have features of both benign and malignant vascular tumors    .
These tumors usually occur on or under the skin on the arms or legs    .
They may also occur on the head , neck , or chest    .
Composite hemangioendotheliomas are not likely to metastasize ( spread ) but they may come back in the same place    .
When the tumors metastasize , they usually spread to nearby lymph nodes    .
Diagnostic Tests
See the General Information section for a description of tests and procedures used to diagnose composite hemangioendothelioma and find out whether the tumor has spread    .
Treatment Treatment of composite hemangioendotheliomas may include the following : - Surgery to remove the tumor    .
- Radiation therapy and chemotherapy for tumors that have spread    .
Kaposi Sarcoma
Kaposi sarcoma is a cancer that causes lesions to grow in the skin ; the mucous membranes lining the mouth , nose , and throat ; lymph nodes ; or other organs    .
It is caused by the Kaposi sarcoma herpes virus ( KSHV )    .
In the United States , it usually occurs in people who have a weak immune system caused by AIDS or by drugs used in organ transplants    .
It is very rare in children and can be caused by HIV infection and rare immune system disorders    .
Signs Signs in children may include the following : - Lesions in the skin , mouth , or throat    .
Skin lesions are red , purple , or brown and change from flat , to raised , to scaly areas called plaques , to nodules    .
- Swollen lymph nodes    .
Diagnostic Tests See the General Information section for a description of tests and procedures used to diagnose Kaposi sarcoma    .
Treatment Treatment of Kaposi sarcoma may include the following : - Chemotherapy    .
See the PDQ summary on Kaposi Sarcoma Treatment for information about Kaposi sarcoma in adults    .
Malignant Tumors
Epithelioid Hemangioendothelioma
Epithelioid hemangioendotheliomas can occur in children , but are most common in adults between 30 and 50 years of age    .
They usually occur in the liver , lung , or in bone    .
They may be either fast growing or slow growing    .
In about a third of cases , the tumor spreads to other parts of the body very quickly    .
Signs and Symptoms Signs and symptoms depend on where the tumor is : - On the skin , the tumors can be raised and rounded or flat , red - brown patches that feel warm    .
- In the lung , there may be no early symptoms    .
Signs and symptoms that occur may include : - Chest pain    .
- Spitting up blood    .
- Anemia ( weakness , feeling tired , or looking pale )    .
- Trouble breathing ( from scarred lung tissue )    .
- In bone , the tumors can cause breaks    .
Diagnostic Tests Epithelioid hemangioendotheliomas in the liver are found with CT scans and MRI scans    .
See the General Information section for a description of these tests and procedures used to diagnose epithelioid hemangioendothelioma and find out whether the tumor has spread    .
X - rays may also be done    .
Treatment Treatment of slow - growing epithelioid hemangioendotheliomas includes the following : - Observation    .
Treatment of fast - growing epithelioid hemangioendotheliomas may include the following : - Surgery to remove the tumor when possible    .
- Immunotherapy ( interferon ) and targeted therapy ( thalidomide , sorafenib , pazopanib , sirolimus ) for tumors that are likely to spread    .
- Chemotherapy    .    - Total hepatectomy and liver transplant when the tumor is in the liver    .
Angiosarcoma of the Soft Tissue
Angiosarcomas are fast - growing tumors that form in blood vessels or lymph vessels in any part of the body , usually in soft tissue    .
Most angiosarcomas are in or near the skin    .
Those in deeper soft tissue can form in the liver , spleen , and lung    .
These tumors are very rare in children    .
Children sometimes have more than one tumor in the skin and / or liver    .
Risk Factors
Anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor    .
Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get the disease ; not having risk factors doesnt mean that you will not get the disease    .
Talk with your child 's doctor if you think your child may be at risk    .
Risk factors for angiosarcomas include the following : - Being exposed to radiation    .
- Chronic ( long - term ) lymphedema , a condition in which extra lymph fluid builds up in tissues and causes swelling    .
- Having a benign vascular tumor    .
A benign tumor , such as a hemangioma , may become an angiosarcoma but this rare    .
Signs Signs of angiosarcoma depend on where the tumor is and may include the following : - Red patches on the skin that bleed easily    .
- Purple tumors    .
Diagnostic Tests
See the General Information section for a description of tests and procedures used to diagnose angiosarcoma and find out whether the tumor has spread    .
Treatment Treatment of angiosarcoma may include the following : - Surgery to completely remove the tumor    .    - A combination of surgery , chemotherapy , and radiation therapy for angiosarcomas that have spread    .
- Targeted therapy ( bevacizumab ) and chemotherapy for angiosarcomas that began as infantile hemangiomas    .
- A clinical trial of targeted therapy , radiation therapy , and surgery with or without chemotherapy    .
How to diagnose Childhood Vascular Tumors ?

Tests are used to detect ( find ) and diagnose childhood vascular tumors    .
The following tests and procedures may be used : - Physical exam and history :
An exam of the body to check general signs of health , including checking for signs of disease , such as lumps , lesions , or anything else that seems unusual    .
A history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken    .
- Ultrasound exam :
A procedure in which high - energy sound waves ( ultrasound ) are bounced off internal tissues or organs and make echoes    .
The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram    .
The picture can be printed to be looked at later    .
- CT scan ( CAT scan ) : A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body , taken from different angles    .
The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine    .
A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly    .
This procedure is also called computed tomography , computerized tomography , or computerized axial tomography    .
- MRI ( magnetic resonance imaging ) : A procedure that uses a magnet , radio waves , and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body    .
This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging ( NMRI )    .
- Biopsy :
The removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer    .
A biopsy is not always needed to diagnose a vascular tumor    .
What are the treatments for Childhood Vascular Tumors ?

Key Points
- There are different types of treatment for childhood vascular tumors    .
- Children with childhood vascular tumors should have their treatment planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating cancer in children    .
- Some treatments cause side effects months or years after treatment has ended    .
- Eleven types of standard treatment are used : - Beta - blocker therapy - Surgery - Photocoagulation - Embolization - Chemotherapy - Sclerotherapy - Radiation therapy - Targeted therapy - Immunotherapy - Other drug therapy - Observation - New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials    .
- Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
- Patients can enter clinical trials before , during , or after starting their cancer treatment    .
- Follow - up tests may be needed    .
There are different types of treatment for childhood vascular tumors    .
Different types of treatment are available for children with vascular tumors    .
Some treatments are standard ( the currently used treatment ) , and some are being tested in clinical trials    .
A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments    .
When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment , the new treatment may become the standard treatment    .
Because vascular tumors in children are rare , taking part in a clinical trial should be considered    .
Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment    .
Children with childhood vascular tumors should have their treatment planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating cancer in children    .
Treatment will be overseen by a pediatric oncologist , a doctor who specializes in treating children with cancer    .
The pediatric oncologist works with other pediatric health care providers who are experts in treating children with cancer and who specialize in certain areas of medicine    .
These may include the following specialists : - Pediatric vascular anomaly specialist ( expert in treating children with vascular tumors )    .
- Pediatric surgeon    .
- Orthopedic surgeon    .
- Radiation oncologist    .
- Pediatric nurse specialist    .
- Rehabilitation specialist    .
- Psychologist    .    - Social worker    .
Some treatments cause side effects months or years after treatment has ended    .
Some treatments , such as chemotherapy and radiation therapy , cause side effects that continue or appear months or years after treatment has ended    .
These are called late effects    .
Late effects of treatment may include : - Physical problems    .
- Changes in mood , feelings , thinking , learning , or memory    .
- Second cancers ( new types of cancer )    .
Some late effects may be treated or controlled    .
It is important to talk with your child 's doctors about the possible late effects caused by some treatments    .
( See the PDQ summary on Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer for more information )    .
Eleven types of standard treatment are used :
Beta - blocker therapy Beta - blockers are drugs that decrease blood pressure and heart rate    .
When used in patients with vascular tumors , beta - blockers may help shrink the tumors    .
Beta - blocker therapy may be given by vein ( IV ) , by mouth , or placed on the skin ( topical )    .
The way the beta - blocker therapy is given depends on the type of vascular tumor and where the tumor first formed    .
The beta - blocker propranolol is usually the first treatment for hemangiomas    .
Infants treated with IV propranolol may need to have their treatment started in a hospital    .
Propranolol is also used to treat benign vascular tumor of liver and kaposiform hemangioendothelioma    .
Other beta - blockers used to treat vascular tumors include atenolol , nadolol , and timolol    .
Infantile hemangioma may also be treated with propranolol and steroid therapy or propranolol and topical beta - blocker therapy    .
See the drug information summary on Propranolol Hydrochloride for more information    .
Surgery
The following types of surgery may be used to remove many types of vascular tumors : - Excision : Surgery to remove the entire tumor and some of the healthy tissue around it    .
- Laser surgery : A surgical procedure that uses a laser beam ( a narrow beam of intense light ) as a knife to make bloodless cuts in tissue or to remove a skin lesion such as a tumor    .
Surgery with a pulsed dye laser may be used for some hemangiomas    .
This type of laser uses a beam of light that targets blood vessels in the skin    .
The light is changed into heat and the blood vessels are destroyed without damaging nearby skin    .
- Total hepatectomy and liver transplant : A surgical procedure to remove the entire liver followed by a transplant of a healthy liver from a donor    .
- Curettage : A procedure in which abnormal tissue is removed using a small , spoon - shaped instrument called a curette    .
The type of surgery used depends on the type of vascular tumor and where the tumor formed in the body    .
For malignant tumors , even if the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery , some patients may be given chemotherapy or radiation therapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left    .
Treatment given after the surgery , to lower the risk that the tumor will come back , is called adjuvant therapy    .
Photocoagulation Photocoagulation is the use of an intense beam of light , such as a laser , to seal off blood vessels or destroy tissue    .
It is used to treat pyogenic granuloma    .
Embolization Embolization is a procedure that uses particles , such as tiny gelatin sponges or beads , to block blood vessels in the liver    .
It may be used to treat some benign vascular tumors of the liver and kaposiform hemangioendothelioma    .
Chemotherapy Chemotherapy is a treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of tumor cells , either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing    .
When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle , the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach tumor cells throughout the body ( systemic chemotherapy )    .
When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid , an organ , or a body cavity such as the abdomen , the drugs mainly affect tumor cells in those areas ( regional chemotherapy )    .
Chemotherapy for hemangiomas may also be given topically ( applied to the skin in a cream or lotion )    .
The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type of the vascular tumor being treated    .
Sclerotherapy Sclerotherapy is a treatment used to destroy the blood vessel with the tumor    .
A liquid is injected into the blood vessel , causing it to scar and break down    .
Over time , the destroyed blood vessel is absorbed into normal tissue    .
The blood flows through nearby healthy veins instead    .
Sclerotherapy is used in the treatment of epithelioid hemangioma    .
Radiation therapy Radiation therapy is a treatment that uses high - energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill tumor cells or keep them from growing    .
There are two types of radiation therapy : - External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the tumor    .
- Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles , seeds , wires , or catheters that are placed directly into or near the tumor    .
The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type of the vascular tumor being treated    .
External radiation is used to treat some vascular tumors    .
Targeted therapy Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to attack specific tumor cells    .
Targeted therapies usually cause less harm to normal cells than chemotherapy or radiation therapy do    .
Angiogenesis inhibitors are a type of targeted therapy    .
- Angiogenesis inhibitors are drugs that stop cells from dividing and prevent the growth of new blood vessels that tumors need to grow    .
The targeted therapy drugs thalidomide , sorafenib , pazopanib , sirolimus , and bevacizumab are angiogenesis inhibitors used to treat childhood vascular tumors    .
Immunotherapy Immunotherapy is a treatment that uses the patients immune system to fight disease    .
Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost , direct , or restore the bodys natural defenses against disease    .
Interferon is a type of immunotherapy used to treat childhood vascular tumors    .
It interferes with the division of tumor cells and can slow tumor growth    .
It is used in the treatment of juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma , kaposiform hemangioendothelioma , and epithelioid hemangioendothelioma    .
Other drug therapy
Other drugs used to treat childhood vascular tumors or manage their effects include the following : - Steroid therapy : Steroids are hormones made naturally in the body    .
They can also be made in a laboratory and used as drugs    .
Steroid drugs help shrink some vascular tumors    .
- Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) : NSAIDs are commonly used to decrease fever , swelling , pain , and redness    .
Examples of NSAIDs are aspirin , ibuprofen , and naproxen    .
In the treatment of vascular tumors , NSAIDs can increase the flow of blood through the tumors and decrease the chance that an unwanted blood clot will form    .
- Antifibrinolytic therapy :
These drugs help the blood clot in patients who have Kasabach - Merritt syndrome    .
Fibrin is the main protein in a blood clot that helps stop bleeding and heal wounds    .
Some vascular tumors cause fibrin to break down and the patient 's blood does not clot normally , causing uncontrolled bleeding    .
Antifibrinolytics help prevent the breakdown of fibrin    .
Observation Observation is closely monitoring a patients condition without giving any treatment until signs or symptoms appear or change    .
New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials    .
Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website    .
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
For some patients , taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice    .
Clinical trials are part of the research process    .
Clinical trials are done to find out if new treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment    .
Many of today 's standard treatments are based on earlier clinical trials    .
Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment    .
Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way disease will be treated in the future    .
Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments , they often answer important questions and help move research forward    .
Patients can enter clinical trials before , during , or after starting their cancer treatment    .
Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment    .
Other trials test treatments for patients whose tumors have not gotten better    .
There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop tumors from recurring ( coming back ) or reduce the side effects of treatment    .
Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country    .
See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials    .
These have been retrieved from NCI 's listing of clinical trials    .
Follow - up tests may be needed    .
Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the vascular tumor may be repeated    .
Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working    .
Decisions about whether to continue , change , or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests    .
Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended    .
The results of these tests can show if your child 's condition has changed or if the tumor has recurred ( come back )    .
These tests are sometimes called follow - up tests or check - ups    .

Adult Hodgkin lymphoma is a disease in which malignant ( cancer ) cells form in the lymph system    .
Adult Hodgkin lymphoma is a type of cancer that develops in the lymph system , part of the body 's immune system    .
The immune system protects the body from foreign substances , infection , and diseases    .
The lymph system is made up of the following : - Lymph : Colorless , watery fluid that carries white blood cells called lymphocytes through the lymph system    .
Lymphocytes protect the body against infections and the growth of tumors    .
- Lymph vessels : A network of thin tubes that collect lymph from different parts of the body and return it to the bloodstream    .
- Lymph nodes : Small , bean - shaped structures that filter lymph and store white blood cells that help fight infection and disease    .
Lymph nodes are located along the network of lymph vessels found throughout the body    .
Clusters of lymph nodes are found in the neck , underarm , abdomen , pelvis , and groin    .
- Spleen :
An organ that makes lymphocytes , filters the blood , stores blood cells , and destroys old blood cells    .
It is located on the left side of the abdomen near the stomach    .
- Thymus :
An organ in which lymphocytes grow and multiply    .
The thymus is in the chest behind the breastbone    .
- Tonsils :
Two small masses of lymph tissue at the back of the throat    .
The tonsils make lymphocytes    .
- Bone marrow :
The soft , spongy tissue in the center of large bones    .
Bone marrow makes white blood cells , red blood cells , and platelets    .
Lymph tissue is also found in other parts of the body such as the stomach , thyroid gland , brain , and skin    .
Cancer can spread to the liver and lungs    .
Lymphomas are divided into two general types : Hodgkin lymphoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma    .
This summary is about the treatment of adult Hodgkin lymphoma    .
( See the PDQ summary on Adult Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Treatment for more information    .    )
Hodgkin lymphoma can occur in both adults and children    .
Treatment for adults is different than treatment for children    .
Hodgkin lymphoma may also occur in patients who have acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) ; these patients require special treatment    .
See the following PDQ summaries for more information : - Childhood Hodgkin Lymphoma Treatment - AIDS - Related Lymphoma Treatment Hodgkin lymphoma in pregnant women is the same as the disease in nonpregnant women of childbearing age    .
However , treatment is different for pregnant women    .
This summary includes information about treating Hodgkin lymphoma during pregnancy    .
There are two main types of Hodgkin lymphoma : classical and nodular lymphocyte - predominant    .
Most Hodgkin lymphomas are the classical type    .
The classical type is broken down into the following four subtypes : - Nodular sclerosing Hodgkin lymphoma    .    - Mixed cellularity Hodgkin lymphoma    .    - Lymphocyte depletion Hodgkin lymphoma    .
 हॉजकिन लिंफोमा।
- Lymphocyte - rich classical Hodgkin lymphoma    .
Who is at risk for Adult Hodgkin Lymphoma? ?

Age , gender , and Epstein - Barr infection can affect the risk of adult Hodgkin lymphoma    .
Anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor    .
Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer ; not having risk factors does n't mean that you will not get cancer    .
Talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk    .
Risk factors for adult Hodgkin lymphoma include the following : - Being in young or late adulthood    .
- Being male    .
- Being infected with the Epstein - Barr virus    .
- Having a first - degree relative ( parent , brother , or sister ) with Hodgkin lymphoma    .
Pregnancy is not a risk factor for Hodgkin lymphoma    .
What are the symptoms of Adult Hodgkin Lymphoma ?

Signs of adult Hodgkin lymphoma include swollen lymph nodes , fever , night sweats , and weight loss    .
These and other signs and symptoms may be caused by adult Hodgkin lymphoma or by other conditions    .
Check with your doctor if any of the following do not go away : - Painless , swollen lymph nodes in the neck , underarm , or groin    .
- Fever for no known reason    .
- Drenching night sweats    .
- Weight loss for no known reason    .
- Itchy skin    .
- Feeling very tired    .
How to diagnose Adult Hodgkin Lymphoma ?

Tests that examine the lymph nodes are used to detect ( find ) and diagnose adult Hodgkin lymphoma    .
The following tests and procedures may be used : - Physical exam and history :
An exam of the body to check general signs of health , including checking for signs of disease , such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual    .
A history of the patient 's past illnesses and treatments will also be taken    .
- Complete blood count ( CBC ) : A procedure in which a sample of blood is drawn and checked for the following : - The number of red blood cells , white blood cells , and platelets    .
- The amount of hemoglobin ( the protein that carries oxygen ) in the red blood cells    .
- The portion of the sample made up of red blood cells    .
- Blood chemistry studies :
A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body    .
An unusual ( higher or lower than normal ) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease    .
- Sedimentation rate : A procedure in which a sample of blood is drawn and checked for the rate at which the red blood cells settle to the bottom of the test tube    .
The sedimentation rate is a measure of how much inflammation is in the body    .
A higher than normal sedimentation rate may be a sign of lymphoma or another condition    .
Also called erythrocyte sedimentation rate , sed rate , or ESR    .
- Lymph node biopsy :
The removal of all or part of a lymph node    .
One of the following types of biopsies may be done : - Excisional biopsy :
The removal of an entire lymph node    .
- Incisional biopsy :
The removal of part of a lymph node    .
- Core biopsy :
The removal of part of a lymph node using a wide needle    .
A pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells , especially Reed - Sternberg cells    .
Reed - Sternberg cells are common in classical Hodgkin lymphoma    .
The following test may be done on tissue that was removed : - Immunophenotyping :
A laboratory test used to identify cells , based on the types of antigens or markers on the surface of the cell    .
This test is used to diagnose the specific type of lymphoma by comparing the cancer cells to normal cells of the immune system    .
What is the outlook for Adult Hodgkin Lymphoma ?

Certain factors affect prognosis ( chance of recovery ) and treatment options    .
The prognosis ( chance of recovery ) and treatment options depend on the following : - The patient 's signs and symptoms    .
- The stage of the cancer    .    - The type of Hodgkin lymphoma    .    - Blood test results    .    - The patient 's age , gender , and general health    .
- Whether the cancer is recurrent or progressive    .
For Hodgkin lymphoma during pregnancy , treatment options also depend on : - The wishes of the patient    .    - The age of the fetus    .
Adult Hodgkin lymphoma can usually be cured if found and treated early    .
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Adult Hodgkin Lymphoma ?

New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials    .
This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials    .
It may not mention every new treatment being studied    .
Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website    .
Chemotherapy and radiation therapy with stem cell transplant High - dose chemotherapy and radiation therapy with stem cell transplant is a way of giving high doses of chemotherapy and radiation therapy and replacing blood - forming cells destroyed by the cancer treatment    .
Stem cells ( immature blood cells ) are removed from the blood or bone marrow of the patient or a donor and are frozen and stored    .
After therapy is completed , the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion    .
These reinfused stem cells grow into ( and restore ) the body 's blood cells    .
The use of lower - dose chemotherapy and radiation therapy with stem cell transplant is also being studied    .
Monoclonal antibody therapy Monoclonal antibody therapy is a cancer treatment that uses antibodies made in the laboratory , from a single type of immune system cell    .
These antibodies can identify substances on cancer cells or normal substances that may help cancer cells grow    .
The antibodies attach to the substances and kill the cancer cells , block their growth , or keep them from spreading    .
Monoclonal antibodies are given by infusion    .
They may be used alone or to carry drugs , toxins , or radioactive material directly to cancer cells    .
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
For some patients , taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice    .
Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process    .
Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment    .
Many of today 's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials    .
Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment    .
Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future    .
Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments , they often answer important questions and help move research forward    .
Patients can enter clinical trials before , during , or after starting their cancer treatment    .
Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment    .
Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better    .
There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring ( coming back ) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment    .

What are the stages of Adult Hodgkin Lymphoma ?

Key Points
- After adult Hodgkin lymphoma has been diagnosed , tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the lymph system or to other parts of the body    .
- There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body    .
- Stages of adult Hodgkin lymphoma may include A , B , E , and S   .    - The following stages are used for adult Hodgkin lymphoma : - Stage I - Stage II - Stage III - Stage IV - Adult Hodgkin lymphoma may be grouped for treatment as follows : - Early Favorable - Early Unfavorable - Advanced
After adult Hodgkin lymphoma has been diagnosed , tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the lymph system or to other parts of the body    .
The process used to find out if cancer has spread within the lymph system or to other parts of the body is called staging    .
The information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease    .
It is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment    .
The following tests and procedures may be used in the staging process : - CT scan ( CAT scan ) :
A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body , taken from different angles    .
The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine    .
A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly    .
This procedure is also called computed tomography , computerized tomography , or computerized axial tomography    .
For adult Hodgkin lymphoma , CT scans of the neck , chest , abdomen , and pelvis are taken    .
- PET -CT scan :
A procedure that combines the pictures from a positron emission tomography ( PET ) scan and a computed tomography ( CT ) scan    .
The PET and CT scans are done at the same time on the same machine    .
The pictures from both scans are combined to make a more detailed picture than either test would make by itself    .
A PET scan is a procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body    .
A small amount of radioactive glucose ( sugar ) is injected into a vein    .
The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body    .
Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do    .
- Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy :
The removal of bone marrow , blood , and a small piece of bone by inserting a hollow needle into the hipbone or breastbone    .
A pathologist views the bone marrow , blood , and bone under a microscope to look for signs of cancer    .
For pregnant women with Hodgkin lymphoma , staging tests that protect the fetus from the harms of radiation are used    .
These include : - MRI ( magnetic resonance imaging ) : A procedure that uses a magnet , radio waves , and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body    .
This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging ( NMRI )    .
- Ultrasound exam :
A procedure in which high - energy sound waves ( ultrasound ) are bounced off internal tissues or organs and make echoes    .
The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram    .
There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body    .
Cancer can spread through tissue , the lymph system , and the blood : - Tissue    .
The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas    .
- Lymph system    .
The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system    .
The cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body    .
- Blood    .
The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood    .
The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body    .
Stages of adult Hodgkin lymphoma may include A , B , E , and S    .
Adult Hodgkin lymphoma may be described as follows : - A : The patient does not have B symptoms ( fever , weight loss , or night sweats )    .
- B : The patient has B symptoms    .
- E : Cancer is found in an organ or tissue that is not part of the lymph system but which may be next to an involved area of the lymph system    .
- S : Cancer is found in the spleen    .
The following stages are used for adult Hodgkin lymphoma :
Stage I Stage I is divided into stage I and stage IE    .
- Stage I : Cancer is found in one of the following places in the lymph system : - One or more lymph nodes in one lymph node group    .
- Waldeyer 's ring    .
- Thymus    .    - Spleen    .    - Stage IE : Cancer is found outside the lymph system in one organ or area    .
Stage II Stage II is divided into stage II and stage IIE    .
- Stage II : Cancer is found in two or more lymph node groups either above or below the diaphragm ( the thin muscle below the lungs that helps breathing and separates the chest from the abdomen )    .
- Stage IIE : Cancer is found in one or more lymph node groups either above or below the diaphragm and outside the lymph nodes in a nearby organ or area    .
Stage III Stage III is divided into stage III , stage IIIE , stage IIIS , and stage IIIE , S   .    - Stage III : Cancer is found in lymph node groups above and below the diaphragm ( the thin muscle below the lungs that helps breathing and separates the chest from the abdomen )    .
- Stage IIIE : Cancer is found in lymph node groups above and below the diaphragm and outside the lymph nodes in a nearby organ or area    .
- Stage IIIS : Cancer is found in lymph node groups above and below the diaphragm , and in the spleen    .
- Stage IIIE,S : Cancer is found in lymph node groups above and below the diaphragm , outside the lymph nodes in a nearby organ or area , and in the spleen    .
Stage IV
In stage IV , the cancer : - is found outside the lymph nodes throughout one or more organs , and may be in lymph nodes near those organs ; or - is found outside the lymph nodes in one organ and has spread to areas far away from that organ ; or - is found in the lung , liver , bone marrow , or cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF )    .
The cancer has not spread to the lung , liver , bone marrow , or CSF from nearby areas    .
Adult Hodgkin lymphoma may be grouped for treatment as follows :
Early Favorable Early favorable adult Hodgkin lymphoma is stage I or stage II , without risk factors    .
Early Unfavorable Early unfavorable adult Hodgkin lymphoma is stage I or stage II with one or more of the following risk factors : - A tumor in the chest that is larger than 1/3 of the width of the chest or at least 10 centimeters    .
- Cancer in an organ other than the lymph nodes    .    - A high sedimentation rate ( in a sample of blood , the red blood cells settle to the bottom of the test tube more quickly than normal )    .
- Three or more lymph nodes with cancer    .
- Symptoms such as fever , weight loss , or night sweats    .
Advanced Advanced Hodgkin lymphoma includes some or all of the following risk factors : - Being male    .
- Being aged 45 years or older    .
- Having stage IV disease    .
- Having a low blood albumin ( protein ) level ( below 4 )    .    - Having a low hemoglobin level ( below 10   .   5 )    .
- Having a high white blood cell count ( 15,000 or higher )    .
- Having a low lymphocyte count ( below 600 or less than 8 % of the white blood cell count )    .

- Chemotherapy and radiation therapy with stem cell transplant - Monoclonal antibody therapy - Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
- Patients can enter clinical trials before , during , or after starting their cancer treatment    .
- Follow - up tests may be needed    .
There are different types of treatment for patients with adult Hodgkin lymphoma    .
Different types of treatment are available for patients with adult Hodgkin lymphoma    .
Some treatments are standard ( the currently used treatment ) , and some are being tested in clinical trials    .
A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer    .
When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment , the new treatment may become the standard treatment    .
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment    .
For pregnant women with Hodgkin lymphoma , treatment is carefully chosen to protect the fetus    .
Treatment decisions are based on the mothers wishes , the stage of the Hodgkin lymphoma , and the age of the fetus    .
The treatment plan may change as the signs and symptoms , cancer , and pregnancy change    .
Choosing the most appropriate cancer treatment is a decision that ideally involves the patient , family , and health care team    .
Patients with Hodgkin lymphoma should have their treatment planned by a team of health care providers with expertise in treating lymphomas    .
Treatment will be overseen by a medical oncologist , a doctor who specializes in treating cancer    .
The medical oncologist may refer you to other health care providers who have experience and expertise in treating adult Hodgkin lymphoma and who specialize in certain areas of medicine    .
These may include the following specialists : - Neurosurgeon    .    - Neurologist    .
- Rehabilitation specialist    .
- Radiation oncologist    .
- Endocrinologist    .    - Hematologist    .    - Other oncology specialists    .
Patients may develop late effects that appear months or years after their treatment for Hodgkin lymphoma    .
Treatment with chemotherapy and / or radiation therapy for Hodgkin lymphoma may increase the risk of second cancers and other health problems for many months or years after treatment    .
These late effects depend on the type of treatment and the patient 's age when treated , and may include : - Acute myelogenous leukemia    .
- Cancer of the breast , bone , cervix , gastrointestinal tract , head and neck , lung , soft tissue , and thyroid    .
- Heart , lung , and thyroid disease    .
- Avascular necrosis of bone ( death of bone cells caused by lack of blood flow )    .
- Herpes zoster ( shingles ) or severe infection    .
- Depression and fatigue    .
- Infertility    .    - Hypogonadism ( low levels of testosterone and estrogen )    .
Regular follow - up by doctors who are expert in finding and treating late effects is important for the long - term health of patients treated for Hodgkin lymphoma    .
Three types of standard treatment are used :
Chemotherapy Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells , either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing    .
When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle , the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body ( systemic chemotherapy )    .
When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid , an organ , or a body cavity such as the abdomen , the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas ( regional chemotherapy )    .
The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated    .
Combination chemotherapy is treatment with more than one anticancer drug    .
When a pregnant woman is treated with chemotherapy for Hodgkin lymphoma , it is n't possible to protect the fetus from being exposed to the chemotherapy    .
Some chemotherapy regimens may cause birth defects if given in the first trimester    .
Vinblastine is an anticancer drug that has not been linked with birth defects when given in the second half of pregnancy    .
विनब्लास्टाइन एक एंटीकैंसर ड्रग है, जिसे गर्भावस्था के दूसरे भाग में दिए जाने पर जन्म दोषों नहीं होते।
See Drugs Approved for Hodgkin Lymphoma for more information    .
Radiation therapy Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high - energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing    .
There are two types of radiation therapy : - External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer    .
- Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles , seeds , wires , or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer    .
The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated    .
External radiation therapy is used to treat adult Hodgkin lymphoma    .
For a pregnant woman with Hodgkin lymphoma , radiation therapy should be postponed until after delivery , if possible , to avoid any risk to the fetus    .
If immediate treatment is needed , the woman may decide to continue the pregnancy and receive radiation therapy    .
However , lead used to shield the fetus may not protect it from scattered radiation that could possibly cause cancer in the future    .
Surgery Laparotomy is a procedure in which an incision ( cut ) is made in the wall of the abdomen to check the inside of the abdomen for signs of disease    .
The size of the incision depends on the reason the laparotomy is being done    .
Sometimes organs are removed or tissue samples are taken and checked under a microscope for signs of disease    .
If cancer is found , the tissue or organ is removed during the laparotomy    .
For pregnant patients with Hodgkin lymphoma , treatment options also include :
Watchful waiting Watchful waiting is closely monitoring a patients condition without giving any treatment unless signs or symptoms appear or change    .
Delivery may be induced when the fetus is 32 to 36 weeks old , so that the mother can begin treatment    .
Steroid therapy Steroids are hormones made naturally in the body by the adrenal glands and by reproductive organs    .
Some types of steroids are made in a laboratory    .
Certain steroid drugs have been found to help chemotherapy work better and help stop the growth of cancer cells    .
Steroids can also help the lungs of the fetus develop faster than normal    .
This is important when delivery is induced early    .
See Drugs Approved for Hodgkin Lymphoma for more information    .
New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials    .
This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials    .
It may not mention every new treatment being studied    .
Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website    .
Chemotherapy and radiation therapy with stem cell transplant High - dose chemotherapy and radiation therapy with stem cell transplant is a way of giving high doses of chemotherapy and radiation therapy and replacing blood - forming cells destroyed by the cancer treatment    .
Stem cells ( immature blood cells ) are removed from the blood or bone marrow of the patient or a donor and are frozen and stored    .
After therapy is completed , the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion    .
These reinfused stem cells grow into ( and restore ) the body 's blood cells    .
The use of lower - dose chemotherapy and radiation therapy with stem cell transplant is also being studied    .
Monoclonal antibody therapy Monoclonal antibody therapy is a cancer treatment that uses antibodies made in the laboratory , from a single type of immune system cell    .
These antibodies can identify substances on cancer cells or normal substances that may help cancer cells grow    .
The antibodies attach to the substances and kill the cancer cells , block their growth , or keep them from spreading    .
Monoclonal antibodies are given by infusion    .
They may be used alone or to carry drugs , toxins , or radioactive material directly to cancer cells    .
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
For some patients , taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice    .
Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process    .
Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment    .
Many of today 's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials    .
Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment    .
Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future    .
Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments , they often answer important questions and help move research forward    .
Patients can enter clinical trials before , during , or after starting their cancer treatment    .
Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment    .
Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better    .
There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring ( coming back ) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment    .
Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country    .
See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials    .
These have been retrieved from NCI 's listing of clinical trials    .
Follow - up tests may be needed    .
Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated    .
Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working    .
Decisions about whether to continue , change , or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests    .
Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended    .
The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred ( come back )    .
These tests are sometimes called follow - up tests or check - ups    .

Treatment Options for Hodgkin Lymphoma During Pregnancy
Hodgkin Lymphoma During the First Trimester of Pregnancy
When Hodgkin lymphoma is diagnosed in the first trimester of pregnancy , it does not necessarily mean that the woman will be advised to end the pregnancy    .
Each woman 's treatment will depend on the stage of the lymphoma , how fast it is growing , and her wishes    .
For women who choose to continue the pregnancy , treatment of Hodgkin lymphoma during the first trimester of pregnancy may include the following : - Watchful waiting when the cancer is above the diaphragm and is slow - growing    .
Delivery may be induced when the fetus is 32 to 36 weeks old so the mother can begin treatment    .
- Radiation therapy above the diaphragm    .
( A lead shield is used to protect the fetus from the radiation as much as possible    .    )
- Systemic chemotherapy using one or more drugs    .
Hodgkin Lymphoma During the Second Half of Pregnancy
When Hodgkin lymphoma is diagnosed in the second half of pregnancy , most women can delay treatment until after the baby is born    .
Treatment of Hodgkin lymphoma during the second half of pregnancy may include the following : - Watchful waiting , with plans to induce delivery when the fetus is 32 to 36 weeks old    .
- Systemic chemotherapy using one or more drugs    .
- Steroid therapy    .
- Radiation therapy to relieve breathing problems caused by a large tumor in the chest    .
What is (are) Adult Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma ?

Key Points
- Adult non-Hodgkin lymphoma is a disease in which malignant ( cancer ) cells form in the lymph system    .
- The major types of lymphoma are Hodgkin lymphoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma    .
- Non-Hodgkin lymphoma can be indolent or aggressive    .
- Age , gender , and a weakened immune system can affect the risk of adult non-Hodgkin lymphoma    .
- Signs and symptoms of adult non-Hodgkin lymphoma include swelling in the lymph nodes , fever , night sweats , weight loss , and fatigue    .
- Tests that examine the body and lymph system are used to help detect ( find ) and diagnose adult non-Hodgkin lymphoma    .
- Certain factors affect prognosis ( chance of recovery ) and treatment options    .
Adult non-Hodgkin lymphoma is a disease in which malignant ( cancer ) cells form in the lymph system    .
Non-Hodgkin lymphoma is a type of cancer that forms in the lymph system , which is part of the body 's immune system    .
The immune system protects the body from foreign substances , infection , and diseases    .
The lymph system is made up of the following : - Lymph : Colorless , watery fluid that carries white blood cells called lymphocytes through the lymph system    .
Lymphocytes protect the body against infection and the growth of tumors    .
There are three types of lymphocytes : - B lymphocytes that make antibodies to help fight infection    .
Also called B cells    .
Most types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma begin in B lymphocytes    .    - T lymphocytes that help B lymphocytes make the antibodies that help fight infection    .
Also called T cells    .
- Natural killer cells that attack cancer cells and viruses    .
Also called NK cells    .
Non-Hodgkin lymphoma can begin in B lymphocytes , T lymphocytes , or natural killer cells    .
Lymphocytes can also be found in the blood and also collect in the lymph nodes , spleen , and thymus    .
- Lymph vessels : A network of thin tubes that collect lymph from different parts of the body and return it to the bloodstream    .
- Lymph nodes : Small , bean - shaped structures that filter lymph and store white blood cells that help fight infection and disease    .
Lymph nodes are located along the network of lymph vessels found throughout the body    .
Clusters of lymph nodes are found in the neck , underarm , abdomen , pelvis , and groin    .
- Spleen :
An organ that makes lymphocytes , filters the blood , stores blood cells , and destroys old blood cells    .
It is on the left side of the abdomen near the stomach    .
- Thymus :
An organ in which lymphocytes grow and multiply    .
The thymus is in the chest behind the breastbone    .
- Tonsils :
Two small masses of lymph tissue at the back of the throat    .
The tonsils make lymphocytes    .
- Bone marrow :
The soft , spongy tissue in the center of large bones    .
Bone marrow makes white blood cells , red blood cells , and platelets    .
Lymph tissue is also found in other parts of the body such as the stomach , thyroid gland , brain , and skin    .
Cancer can spread to the liver and lungs    .
Non-Hodgkin lymphoma during pregnancy is rare    .
Non-Hodgkin lymphoma in pregnant women is the same as the disease in nonpregnant women of childbearing age    .
However , treatment is different for pregnant women    .
This summary includes information on the treatment of non-Hodgkin lymphoma during pregnancy ( see the Treatment Options for Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma During Pregnancy section for more information )    .
Non-Hodgkin lymphoma can occur in both adults and children    .
Treatment for adults is different than treatment for children    .
( See the PDQ summary on Childhood Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Treatment for more information    .    )
The major types of lymphoma are Hodgkin lymphoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma    .
Lymphomas are divided into two general types : Hodgkin lymphoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma    .
This summary is about the treatment of adult non-Hodgkin lymphoma    .
For information about certain types of lymphoma , see the following PDQ summaries : - Adult Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Treatment ( lymphoblastic lymphoma ) - Adult Hodgkin Lymphoma Treatment - AIDS - Related Lymphoma Treatment - Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Treatment ( small lymphocytic lymphoma ) - Mycosis Fungoides and the Szary Syndrome Treatment ( cutaneous T - cell lymphoma ) - Primary CNS Lymphoma Treatment
Non-Hodgkin lymphoma can be indolent or aggressive    .
Non-Hodgkin lymphoma grows and spreads at different rates and can be indolent or aggressive    .
Indolent lymphoma tends to grow and spread slowly , and has few signs and symptoms    .
Aggressive lymphoma grows and spreads quickly , and has signs and symptoms that can be severe    .
The treatments for indolent and aggressive lymphoma are different    .
This summary is about the following types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma : Indolent non-Hodgkin lymphomas - Follicular lymphoma    .
Follicular lymphoma is the most common type of indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma    .
It is a very slow - growing type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that begins in B lymphocytes    .
It affects the lymph nodes and may spread to the bone marrow or spleen    .
Most patients with follicular lymphoma are age 50 years and older when they are diagnosed    .
Follicular lymphoma may go away without treatment    .
The patient is closely watched for signs or symptoms that the disease has come back    .
Treatment is needed if signs or symptoms occur after the cancer disappeared or after initial cancer treatment    .
Sometimes follicular lymphoma can become a more aggressive type of lymphoma , such as diffuse large B - cell lymphoma    .
- Lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma    .
In most cases of lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma , B lymphocytes that are turning into plasma cells make large amounts of a protein called monoclonal immunoglobulin M ( IgM ) antibody    .
High levels of IgM antibody in the blood cause the blood plasma to thicken    .
This may cause signs or symptoms such as trouble seeing or hearing , heart problems , shortness of breath , headache , dizziness , and numbness or tingling of the hands and feet    .
Sometimes there are no signs or symptoms of lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma    .
It may be found when a blood test is done for another reason    .
Lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma often spreads to the bone marrow , lymph nodes , and spleen    .
It is also called Waldenstrm macroglobulinemia    .
- Marginal zone lymphoma    .
This type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma begins in B lymphocytes in a part of lymph tissue called the marginal zone    .
There are five different types of marginal zone lymphoma    .
They are grouped by the type of tissue where the lymphoma formed : - Nodal marginal zone lymphoma    .
Nodal marginal zone lymphoma forms in lymph nodes    .
This type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma is rare    .
It is also called monocytoid B - cell lymphoma    .
- Gastric mucosa - associated lymphoid tissue ( MALT ) lymphoma    .
Gastric MALT lymphoma usually begins in the stomach    .
This type of marginal zone lymphoma forms in cells in the mucosa that help make antibodies    .
Patients with gastric MALT lymphoma may also have Helicobacter gastritis or an autoimmune disease , such as Hashimoto thyroiditis or Sjgren syndrome    .
- Extragastric MALT lymphoma    .
Extragastric MALT lymphoma begins outside of the stomach in almost every part of the body including other parts of the gastrointestinal tract , salivary glands , thyroid , lung , skin , and around the eye    .
This type of marginal zone lymphoma forms in cells in the mucosa that help make antibodies    .
Extragastric MALT lymphoma may come back many years after treatment    .
- Mediterranean abdominal lymphoma    .
This is a type of MALT lymphoma that occurs in young adults in eastern Mediterranean countries    .
It often forms in the abdomen and patients may also be infected with bacteria called Campylobacter jejuni    .
This type of lymphoma is also called immunoproliferative small intestinal disease    .
- Splenic marginal zone lymphoma    .
This type of marginal zone lymphoma begins in the spleen and may spread to the peripheral blood and bone marrow    .
The most common sign of this type of splenic marginal zone lymphoma is a spleen that is larger than normal    .
- Primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma    .
This type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma is in the skin only    .
It can be a benign ( not cancer ) nodule that may go away on its own or it can spread to many places on the skin and need treatment    .
Aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphomas - Diffuse large B - cell lymphoma    .
Diffuse large B - cell lymphoma is the most common type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma    .
It grows quickly in the lymph nodes and often the spleen , liver , bone marrow , or other organs are also affected    .
Signs and symptoms of diffuse large B - cell lymphoma may include fever , recurring night sweats , and weight loss    .
These are also called B symptoms    .
Primary mediastinal large B - cell lymphoma is a type of diffuse large B - cell lymphoma    .
- Primary mediastinal large B - cell lymphoma    .
This type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma is marked by the overgrowth of fibrous ( scar - like ) lymph tissue    .
A tumor most often forms behind the breastbone    .
It may press on the airways and cause coughing and trouble breathing    .
Most patients with primary mediastinal large B - cell lymphoma are women who are age 30 to 40 years    .
- Follicular large cell lymphoma , stage III    .
Follicular large cell lymphoma , stage III , is a very rare type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma    .
It is more like diffuse large B - cell lymphoma than other types of follicular lymphoma    .
- Anaplastic large cell lymphoma    .
Anaplastic large cell lymphoma is a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that usually begins in T lymphocytes    .
The cancer cells also have a marker called CD30 on the surface of the cell    .
There are two types of anaplastic large cell lymphoma : - Cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma    .
This type of anaplastic large cell lymphoma mostly affects the skin , but other parts of the body may also be affected    .
Signs of cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma include one or more bumps or ulcers on the skin    .
- Systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma    .
This type of anaplastic large cell lymphoma begins in the lymph nodes and may affect other parts of the body    .
Patients may have a lot of anaplastic lymphoma kinase ( ALK ) protein inside the lymphoma cells    .
These patients have a better prognosis than patients who do not have extra ALK protein    .
Systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma is more common in children than adults    .
( See the PDQ summary on Childhood Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Treatment for more information    .    ) - Extranodal NK -/T- cell lymphoma    .
Extranodal NK -/ T- cell lymphoma usually begins in the area around the nose    .
It may also affect the paranasal sinus ( hollow spaces in the bones around the nose ) , roof of the mouth , trachea , skin , stomach , and intestines    .
Most cases of extranodal NK -/ T - cell lymphoma have Epstein - Barr virus in the tumor cells    .
Sometimes hemophagocytic syndrome occurs ( a serious condition in which there are too many active histiocytes and T cells that cause severe inflammation in the body )    .
Treatment to suppress the immune system is needed    .
This type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma is not common in the United States    .
- Lymphomatoid granulomatosis    .
Lymphomatoid granulomatosis mostly affects the lungs    .
It may also affect the paranasal sinuses ( hollow spaces in the bones around the nose ) , skin , kidneys , and central nervous system    .
In lymphomatoid granulomatosis , cancer invades the blood vessels and kills tissue    .
Because the cancer may spread to the brain , intrathecal chemotherapy or radiation therapy to the brain is given    .
- Angioimmunoblastic T - cell lymphoma    .
This type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma begins in T cells    .
Swollen lymph nodes are a common sign    .
Other signs may include a skin rash , fever , weight loss , or night sweats    .
There may also be high levels of gamma globulin ( antibodies ) in the blood    .
Patients may also have opportunistic infections because their immune systems are weakened    .
- Peripheral T - cell lymphoma    .
Peripheral T - cell lymphoma begins in mature T lymphocytes    .
This type of T lymphocyte matures in the thymus gland and travels to other lymphatic sites in the body such as the lymph nodes , bone marrow , and spleen    .
There are three subtypes of peripheral T - cell lymphoma : - Hepatosplenic T - cell lymphoma    .
This is an uncommon type of peripheral T - cell lymphoma that occurs mostly in young men    .
It begins in the liver and spleen and the cancer cells also have a T - cell receptor called gamma / delta on the surface of the cell    .
- Subcutaneous panniculitis - like T - cell lymphoma    .
Subcutaneous panniculitis - like T - cell lymphoma begins in the skin or mucosa    .
It may occur with hemophagocytic syndrome ( a serious condition in which there are too many active histiocytes and T cells that cause severe inflammation in the body )    .
Treatment to suppress the immune system is needed    .
- Enteropathy - type intestinal T - cell lymphoma    .
This type of peripheral T - cell lymphoma occurs in the small bowel of patients with untreated celiac disease ( an immune response to gluten that causes malnutrition )    .
Patients who are diagnosed with celiac disease in childhood and stay on a gluten - free diet rarely develop enteropathy - type intestinal T - cell lymphoma    .
- Intravascular large B - cell lymphoma    .
This type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma affects blood vessels , especially the small blood vessels in the brain , kidney , lung , and skin    .
Signs and symptoms of intravascular large B - cell lymphoma are caused by blocked blood vessels    .
It is also called intravascular lymphomatosis    .
- Burkitt lymphoma    .
Burkitt lymphoma is a type of B - cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma that grows and spreads very quickly    .
It may affect the jaw , bones of the face , bowel , kidneys , ovaries , or other organs    .
There are three main types of Burkitt lymphoma ( endemic , sporadic , and immunodeficiency related )    .
Endemic Burkitt lymphoma commonly occurs in Africa and is linked to the Epstein - Barr virus , and sporadic Burkitt lymphoma occurs throughout the world    .
Immunodeficiency - related Burkitt lymphoma is most often seen in patients who have AIDS    .
Burkitt lymphoma may spread to the brain and spinal cord and treatment to prevent its spread may be given    .
Burkitt lymphoma occurs most often in children and young adults ( See the PDQ summary on Childhood Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Treatment for more information    .    )
Burkitt lymphoma is also called diffuse small noncleaved - cell lymphoma    .
- Lymphoblastic lymphoma    .
Lymphoblastic lymphoma may begin in T cells or B cells , but it usually begins in T cells    .
In this type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma , there are too many lymphoblasts ( immature white blood cells ) in the lymph nodes and the thymus gland    .
These lymphoblasts may spread to other places in the body , such as the bone marrow , brain , and spinal cord    .
Lymphoblastic lymphoma is most common in teenagers and young adults    .
It is a lot like acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( lymphoblasts are mostly found in the bone marrow and blood )    .
( See the PDQ summary on Adult Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Treatment for more information    .    ) - Adult T - cell leukemia / lymphoma    .
Adult T - cell leukemia / lymphoma is caused by the human T - cell leukemia virus type 1 ( HTLV - 1 )    .
Signs include bone and skin lesions , high blood calcium levels , and lymph nodes , spleen , and liver that are larger than normal    .
- Mantle cell lymphoma    .
Mantle cell lymphoma is a type of B - cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma that usually occurs in middle - aged or older adults    .
It begins in the lymph nodes and spreads to the spleen , bone marrow , blood , and sometimes the esophagus , stomach , and intestines    .
Patients with mantle cell lymphoma have too much of a protein called cyclin - D1 or a certain gene change in the lymphoma cells    .
In some patients who do not have signs or symptoms of lymphoma delaying the start of treatment does not affect the prognosis    .
- Posttransplantation lymphoproliferative disorder    .
This disease occurs in patients who have had a heart , lung , liver , kidney , or pancreas transplant and need lifelong immunosuppressive therapy    .
Most posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorders affect the B cells and have Epstein - Barr virus in the cells    .
Lymphoproliferative disorders are often treated like cancer    .    - True histiocytic lymphoma    .
This is a rare , very aggressive type of lymphoma    .
It is not known whether it begins in B cells or T cells    .
It does not respond well to treatment with standard chemotherapy    .
- Primary effusion lymphoma    .
Primary effusion lymphoma begins in B cells that are found in an area where there is a large build - up of fluid , such as the areas between the lining of the lung and chest wall ( pleural effusion ) , the sac around the heart and the heart ( pericardial effusion ) , or in the abdominal cavity    .
There is usually no tumor that can be seen    .
This type of lymphoma often occurs in patients who have AIDS    .
- Plasmablastic lymphoma    .
Plasmablastic lymphoma is a type of large B - cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma that is very aggressive    .
It is most often seen in patients with HIV infection    .
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Adult Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma ?

New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials    .
This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials    .
It may not mention every new treatment being studied    .
Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website    .
Vaccine therapy Vaccine therapy is a type of biologic therapy    .
Biologic therapy is a treatment that uses the patients immune system to fight cancer    .
Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost , direct , or restore the bodys natural defenses against cancer    .
This type of cancer treatment is also called biotherapy or immunotherapy    .
Vaccine therapy can also be a type of targeted therapy    .
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
For some patients , taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice    .
Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process    .
Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment    .
Many of today 's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials    .
Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment    .
Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future    .
Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments , they often answer important questions and help move research forward    .
Patients can enter clinical trials before , during , or after starting their cancer treatment    .
Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment    .
Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better    .
There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring ( coming back ) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment    .
Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country    .
See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials    .
These have been retrieved from NCI 's listing of clinical trials    .
Who is at risk for Adult Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma? ?

Age , gender , and a weakened immune system can affect the risk of adult non-Hodgkin lymphoma    .
Anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor    .
Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer ; not having risk factors doesnt mean that you will not get cancer    .
Talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk    .
These and other risk factors may increase the risk of certain types of adult non-Hodgkin lymphoma : - Being older , male , or white    .
- Having one of the following medical conditions : - An inherited immune disorder ( such as hypogammaglobulinemia or Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome )    .    - An autoimmune disease ( such as rheumatoid arthritis , psoriasis , or Sjgren syndrome )    .
- HIV / AIDS    .    - Human T- lymphotrophic virus type I or Epstein - Barr virus infection    .
- Helicobacter pylori infection    .
- Taking immunosuppressant drugs after an organ transplant    .
What are the symptoms of Adult Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma ?

Signs and symptoms of adult non-Hodgkin lymphoma include swelling in the lymph nodes , fever , night sweats , weight loss , and fatigue    .
These signs and symptoms may be caused by adult non-Hodgkin lymphoma or by other conditions    .
Check with your doctor if you have any of the following : - Swelling in the lymph nodes in the neck , underarm , groin , or stomach    .
- Fever for no known reason    .
- Recurring night sweats    .
- Feeling very tired    .
- Weight loss for no known reason    .
- Skin rash or itchy skin    .
- Pain in the chest , abdomen , or bones for no known reason    .
When fever , night sweats , and weight loss occur together , this group of symptoms is called B symptoms    .
Other signs and symptoms of adult non-Hodgkin lymphoma may occur and depend on the following : - Where the cancer forms in the body    .
- The size of the tumor    .
- How fast the tumor grows    .
How to diagnose Adult Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma ?

Tests that examine the body and lymph system are used to help detect ( find ) and diagnose adult non-Hodgkin lymphoma    .
The following tests and procedures may be used : - Physical exam and history :
An exam of the body to check general signs of health , including checking for signs of disease , such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual    .
A history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken    .
- Flow cytometry :
A laboratory test that measures the number of cells in a sample , the percentage of live cells in a sample , and certain characteristics of cells , such as size , shape , and the presence of tumor markers on the cell surface    .
The cells are stained with a light - sensitive dye , placed in a fluid , and passed in a stream before a laser or other type of light    .
The measurements are based on how the light - sensitive dye reacts to the light    .
This test is used to diagnose lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma    .
- Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy :
The removal of bone marrow and a small piece of bone by inserting a needle into the hipbone or breastbone    .
A pathologist views the bone marrow and bone under a microscope to look for signs of cancer    .
- Lymph node biopsy :
The removal of all or part of a lymph node    .
A pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells    .
One of the following types of biopsies may be done : - Excisional biopsy :
The removal of an entire lymph node    .
- Incisional biopsy :
The removal of part of a lymph node    .
- Core biopsy :
The removal of part of a lymph node using a wide needle    .
- Fine - needle aspiration ( FNA ) biopsy :
The removal of tissue or fluid using a thin needle    .
- Laparoscopy : A surgical procedure to look at the organs inside the abdomen to check for signs of disease    .
Small incisions ( cuts ) are made in the wall of the abdomen and a laparoscope ( a thin , lighted tube ) is inserted into one of the incisions    .
Other instruments may be inserted through the same or other incisions to take tissue samples to be checked under a microscope for signs of disease    .
- Laparotomy : A surgical procedure in which an incision ( cut ) is made in the wall of the abdomen to check the inside of the abdomen for signs of disease    .
Tissue samples are taken and checked under a microscope for signs of disease    .
If cancer is found , the following tests may be done to study the cancer cells : - Immunohistochemistry :
A test that uses antibodies to check for certain antigens in a sample of tissue    .
The antibody is usually linked to a radioactive substance or a dye that causes the tissue to light up under a microscope    .
This type of test may be used to tell the difference between different types of cancer    .
- Cytogenetic analysis :
A laboratory test in which cells in a sample of tissue are viewed under a microscope to look for certain changes in the chromosomes    .
- FISH ( fluorescence in situ hybridization ) : A laboratory test used to look at genes or chromosomes in cells and tissues    .
Pieces of DNA that contain a fluorescent dye are made in the laboratory and added to cells or tissues on a glass slide    .
When these pieces of DNA attach to certain genes or areas of chromosomes on the slide , they light up when viewed under a microscope with a special light    .
This type of test is used to look for certain genetic markers    .
- Immunophenotyping :
A process used to identify cells , based on the types of antigens or markers on the surface of the cell    .
This process is used to diagnose specific types of leukemia and lymphoma by comparing the cancer cells to normal cells of the immune system    .
Other tests and procedures may be done depending on the signs and symptoms seen and where the cancer forms in the body    .
What is the outlook for Adult Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma ?

Certain factors affect prognosis ( chance of recovery ) and treatment options    .
The prognosis ( chance of recovery ) and treatment options depend on the following : - The stage of the cancer    .    - The type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma    .    - The amount of lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH ) in the blood    .
- Whether there are certain changes in the genes    .
- The patients age and general health    .
- Whether the lymphoma has just been diagnosed or has recurred ( come back )    .
For non-Hodgkin lymphoma during pregnancy , the treatment options also depend on : - The wishes of the patient    .
- Which trimester of pregnancy the patient is in    .
- Whether the baby can be delivered early    .
Some types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma spread more quickly than others do    .
Most non-Hodgkin lymphomas that occur during pregnancy are aggressive    .
Delaying treatment of aggressive lymphoma until after the baby is born may lessen the mother 's chance of survival    .
Immediate treatment is often recommended , even during pregnancy    .
What are the stages of Adult Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma ?

Key Points
- After adult non-Hodgkin lymphoma has been diagnosed , tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the lymph system or to other parts of the body    .
- There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body    .
- Stages of adult non-Hodgkin lymphoma may include E and S   .    - The following stages are used for adult non-Hodgkin lymphoma : - Stage I - Stage II - Stage III - Stage IV - Adult non-Hodgkin lymphomas may be grouped for treatment according to whether the cancer is indolent or aggressive and whether affected lymph nodes are next to each other in the body    .
After adult non-Hodgkin lymphoma has been diagnosed , tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the lymph system or to other parts of the body    .
The process used to find out the type of cancer and if cancer cells have spread within the lymph system or to other parts of the body is called staging    .
The information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease    .
It is important to know the stage of the disease in order to plan treatment    .
The results of the tests and procedures done to diagnose non-Hodgkin lymphoma are used to help make decisions about treatment    .
The following tests and procedures may also be used in the staging process : - Complete blood count ( CBC ) with differential :
A procedure in which a sample of blood is drawn and checked for the following : - The number of red blood cells and platelets    .
- The number and type of white blood cells    .
- The amount of hemoglobin ( the protein that carries oxygen ) in the red blood cells    .
- The portion of the blood sample made up of red blood cells    .
- Blood chemistry studies :
A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body    .
An unusual ( higher or lower than normal ) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease    .
- CT scan ( CAT scan ) : A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body , such as the lung , lymph nodes , and liver , taken from different angles    .
The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine    .
A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly    .
This procedure is also called computed tomography , computerized tomography , or computerized axial tomography    .
- PET scan ( positron emission tomography scan ) : A procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body    .
A small amount of radioactive glucose ( sugar ) is injected into a vein    .
The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body    .
Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do    .
- MRI ( magnetic resonance imaging ) : A procedure that uses a magnet , radio waves , and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body    .
This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging ( NMRI )    .
- Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy :
The removal of bone marrow and a small piece of bone by inserting a needle into the hipbone or breastbone    .
A pathologist views the bone marrow and bone under a microscope to look for signs of cancer    .
- Lumbar puncture : A procedure used to collect cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) from the spinal column    .
This is done by placing a needle between two bones in the spine and into the CSF around the spinal cord and removing a sample of the fluid    .

The sample of CSF is checked under a microscope for signs that the cancer has spread to the brain and spinal cord    .
This procedure is also called an LP or spinal tap    .
For pregnant women with non-Hodgkin lymphoma , staging tests and procedures that protect the baby from the harms of radiation are used    .
These tests and procedures include MRI , bone marrow aspiration and biopsy , lumbar puncture , and ultrasound    .
An ultrasound exam is a procedure in which high - energy sound waves ( ultrasound ) are bounced off internal tissues or organs and make echoes    .
The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram    .
There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body    .
Cancer can spread through tissue , the lymph system , and the blood : - Tissue    .
The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas    .
- Lymph system    .
The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system    .
The cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body    .
- Blood    .
The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood    .
The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body    .
Stages of adult non-Hodgkin lymphoma may include E and S    .
Adult non-Hodgkin lymphoma may be described as follows : - E : &quot ; E&quot ; stands for extranodal and means the cancer is found in an area or organ other than the lymph nodes or has spread to tissues beyond , but near , the major lymphatic areas    .
- S : &quot ; S&quot ; stands for spleen and means the cancer is found in the spleen    .
The following stages are used for adult non-Hodgkin lymphoma :
Stage I Stage I adult non-Hodgkin lymphoma is divided into stage I and stage IE    .
- Stage I : Cancer is found in one lymphatic area ( lymph node group , tonsils and nearby tissue , thymus , or spleen )    .
- Stage IE : Cancer is found in one organ or area outside the lymph nodes    .
Stage II Stage II adult non-Hodgkin lymphoma is divided into stage II and stage IIE    .
- Stage II : Cancer is found in two or more lymph node groups either above or below the diaphragm ( the thin muscle below the lungs that helps breathing and separates the chest from the abdomen )    .
- Stage IIE : Cancer is found in one or more lymph node groups either above or below the diaphragm    .
Cancer is also found outside the lymph nodes in one organ or area on the same side of the diaphragm as the affected lymph nodes    .
Stage III Stage III adult non-Hodgkin lymphoma is divided into stage III , stage IIIE , stage IIIS , and stage IIIE+S   .    - Stage III : Cancer is found in lymph node groups above and below the diaphragm ( the thin muscle below the lungs that helps breathing and separates the chest from the abdomen )    .
- Stage IIIE : Cancer is found in lymph node groups above and below the diaphragm and outside the lymph nodes in a nearby organ or area    .
- Stage IIIS : Cancer is found in lymph node groups above and below the diaphragm , and in the spleen    .
- Stage IIIE+S : Cancer is found in lymph node groups above and below the diaphragm , outside the lymph nodes in a nearby organ or area , and in the spleen    .
Stage IV
In stage IV adult non-Hodgkin lymphoma , the cancer : - is found throughout one or more organs that are not part of a lymphatic area ( lymph node group , tonsils and nearby tissue , thymus , or spleen ) , and may be in lymph nodes near those organs ; or - is found in one organ that is not part of a lymphatic area and has spread to organs or lymph nodes far away from that organ ; or - is found in the liver , bone marrow , cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) , or lungs ( other than cancer that has spread to the lungs from nearby areas )    .
Adult non-Hodgkin lymphomas may be grouped for treatment according to whether the cancer is indolent or aggressive and whether affected lymph nodes are next to each other in the body    .
See the General Information section for more information on the types of indolent ( slow - growing ) and aggressive ( fast - growing ) non-Hodgkin lymphoma    .
Non-Hodgkin lymphoma can also be described as contiguous or noncontiguous : - Contiguous lymphomas : Lymphomas in which the lymph nodes with cancer are next to each other    .
- Noncontiguous lymphomas : Lymphomas in which the lymph nodes with cancer are not next to each other , but are on the same side of the diaphragm    .
What are the treatments for Adult Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma ?

Key Points
- There are different types of treatment for patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma    .
- Patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma should have their treatment planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating lymphomas    .
- Patients may develop late effects that appear months or years after their treatment for non-Hodgkin lymphoma    .
- Nine types of standard treatment are used : - Radiation therapy - Chemotherapy - Immunotherapy - Targeted therapy - Plasmapheresis - Watchful waiting - Antibiotic therapy - Surgery - Stem cell transplant - New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials    .
- Vaccine therapy - Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
- Patients can enter clinical trials before , during , or after starting their cancer treatment    .
- Follow - up tests may be needed    .
There are different types of treatment for patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma    .
Different types of treatment are available for patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma    .
Some treatments are standard ( the currently used treatment ) , and some are being tested in clinical trials    .
A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer    .
When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment , the new treatment may become the standard treatment    .
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment    .
For pregnant women with non-Hodgkin lymphoma , treatment is carefully chosen to protect the baby    .
Treatment decisions are based on the mothers wishes , the stage of the non-Hodgkin lymphoma , and the age of the baby    .
The treatment plan may change as the signs and symptoms , cancer , and pregnancy change    .
Choosing the most appropriate cancer treatment is a decision that ideally involves the patient , family , and health care team    .
Patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma should have their treatment planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating lymphomas    .
Treatment will be overseen by a medical oncologist , a doctor who specializes in treating cancer , or a hematologist , a doctor who specializes in treating blood cancers    .
The medical oncologist may refer you to other health care providers who have experience and are experts in treating adult non-Hodgkin lymphoma and who specialize in certain areas of medicine    .
These may include the following specialists : - Neurosurgeon    .    - Neurologist    .    - Radiation oncologist    .
- Endocrinologist    .
- Rehabilitation specialist    .    - Other oncology specialists    .
Patients may develop late effects that appear months or years after their treatment for non-Hodgkin lymphoma    .
Side effects from cancer treatment that begin during or after treatment and continue for months or years are called late effects    .
Treatment with chemotherapy , radiation therapy , or stem cell transplant for non-Hodgkin lymphoma may increase the risk of late effects    .
Late effects of cancer treatment may include the following : - Heart problems    .
- Infertility ( inability to have children )    .
- Loss of bone density    .
- Neuropathy ( nerve damage that causes numbness or trouble walking )    .    - A second cancer , such as : - Lung cancer    .    - Brain cancer    .    - Kidney cancer    .    - Bladder cancer    .    - Melanoma    .    - Hodgkin lymphoma    .    - Myelodysplastic syndrome    .    - Acute myeloid leukemia    .
Some late effects may be treated or controlled    .
It is important to talk with your doctor about the effects cancer treatment can have on you    .
Regular follow - up to check for late effects is important    .
Nine types of standard treatment are used :
Radiation therapy Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high - energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing    .
There are two types of radiation therapy : - External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer    .
- Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles , seeds , wires , or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer    .
Total - body irradiation is a type of external radiation therapy that is given to the entire body    .
It may be given before a stem cell transplant    .
The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated    .
External radiation therapy is used to treat adult non-Hodgkin lymphoma , and may also be used as palliative therapy to relieve symptoms and improve quality of life    .
For pregnant women with non-Hodgkin lymphoma , radiation therapy should be given after delivery , if possible , to avoid any risk to the baby    .
If treatment is needed right away , pregnant women may decide to continue the pregnancy and receive radiation therapy    .
However , lead used to shield the baby may not protect it from scattered radiation that could possibly cause cancer in the future    .
Chemotherapy Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells , either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing    .
When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle , the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body ( systemic chemotherapy )    .
When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid ( intrathecal chemotherapy ) , an organ , or a body cavity such as the abdomen , the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas ( regional chemotherapy )    .
Combination chemotherapy is treatment using two or more anticancer drugs    .
Steroid drugs may be added , to lessen inflammation and lower the body 's immune response    .
The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated    .
Intrathecal chemotherapy may also be used in the treatment of lymphoma that first forms in the testicles or sinuses ( hollow areas ) around the nose , diffuse large B - cell lymphoma , Burkitt lymphoma , lymphoblastic lymphoma , and some aggressive T - cell lymphomas    .
It is given to lessen the chance that lymphoma cells will spread to the brain and spinal cord    .
This is called CNS prophylaxis    .
In pregnant women , the baby is exposed to chemotherapy when the mother is treated , and some anticancer drugs cause birth defects    .
Because anticancer drugs are passed to the baby through the mother , both must be watched closely when chemotherapy is given    .
See Drugs Approved for Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma for more information    .
Immunotherapy Immunotherapy is a treatment that uses the patients immune system to fight cancer    .
Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost , direct , or restore the bodys natural defenses against cancer    .
Immunomodulators are a type of immunotherapy    .
Lenalidomide is an immunomodulator used to treat adult non-Hodgkin lymphoma    .
See Drugs Approved for Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma for more information    .
Targeted therapy Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells    .
Monoclonal antibody therapy , proteasome inhibitor therapy , and kinase inhibitor therapy are types of targeted therapy used to treat adult non-Hodgkin lymphoma    .
Monoclonal antibody therapy is a cancer treatment that uses antibodies made in the laboratory from a single type of immune system cell    .
These antibodies can identify substances on cancer cells or normal substances that may help cancer cells grow    .
The antibodies attach to the substances and kill the cancer cells , block their growth , or keep them from spreading    .
They may be used alone or to carry drugs , toxins , or radioactive material directly to cancer cells    .
Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody used to treat many types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma    .
Monoclonal antibodies that have been joined to radioactive material are called radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies    .
Yttrium Y 90 - ibritumomab tiuxetan is an example of a radiolabeled monoclonal antibody    .
Monoclonal antibodies are given by infusion    .
Proteasome inhibitor therapy blocks the action of proteasomes in cancer cells and may prevent the growth of tumors    .
Kinase inhibitor therapy , such as idelalisib , blocks certain proteins , which may help keep lymphoma cells from growing and may kill them    .
It is used to treat indolent lymphoma    .
Ibrutinib , a type of Bruton 's tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy , is used to treat lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma and mantle cell lymphoma    .
See Drugs Approved for Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma for more information    .
Plasmapheresis
If the blood becomes thick with extra antibody proteins and affects circulation , plasmapheresis is done to remove extra plasma and antibody proteins from the blood    .
In this procedure , blood is removed from the patient and sent through a machine that separates the plasma ( the liquid part of the blood ) from the blood cells    .
The patient 's plasma contains the unneeded antibodies and is not returned to the patient    .
The normal blood cells are returned to the bloodstream along with donated plasma or a plasma replacement    .
Plasmapheresis does not keep new antibodies from forming    .
Watchful waiting Watchful waiting is closely monitoring a patients condition without giving any treatment until signs or symptoms appear or change    .
Antibiotic therapy Antibiotic therapy is a treatment that uses drugs to treat infections and cancer caused by bacteria and other microorganisms    .
See Drugs Approved for Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma for more information    .
Surgery Surgery may be used to remove the lymphoma in certain patients with indolent or aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma    .
The type of surgery used depends on where the lymphoma formed in the body : - Local excision for certain patients with mucosa - associated lymphoid tissue ( MALT ) lymphoma , PTLD , and small bowel T - cell lymphoma    .
- Splenectomy for patients with marginal zone lymphoma of the spleen    .
Patients who have a heart , lung , liver , kidney , or pancreas transplant usually need to take drugs to suppress their immune system for the rest of their lives    .
Long - term immunosuppression after an organ transplant can cause a certain type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma called post - transplant lymphoproliferative disorder ( PLTD )    .
Small bowel surgery is often needed to diagnose celiac disease in adults who develop a type of T - cell lymphoma    .
Stem cell transplant
Stem cell transplant is a method of giving high doses of chemotherapy and / or total - body irradiation and then replacing blood - forming cells destroyed by the cancer treatment    .
Stem cells ( immature blood cells ) are removed from the blood or bone marrow of the patient ( autologous transplant ) or a donor ( allogeneic transplant ) and are frozen and stored    .
After the chemotherapy and / or radiation therapy is completed , the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion    .
These reinfused stem cells grow into ( and restore ) the bodys blood cells    .
New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials    .
This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials    .
It may not mention every new treatment being studied    .
Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website    .
Vaccine therapy Vaccine therapy is a type of biologic therapy    .
Biologic therapy is a treatment that uses the patients immune system to fight cancer    .
Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost , direct , or restore the bodys natural defenses against cancer    .
This type of cancer treatment is also called biotherapy or immunotherapy    .
Vaccine therapy can also be a type of targeted therapy    .
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
For some patients , taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice    .
Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process    .
Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment    .
Many of today 's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials    .
Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment    .
Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future    .
Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments , they often answer important questions and help move research forward    .
Patients can enter clinical trials before , during , or after starting their cancer treatment    .
Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment    .
Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better    .
There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring ( coming back ) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment    .
Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country    .
See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials    .
These have been retrieved from NCI 's listing of clinical trials    .
Follow - up tests may be needed    .
Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated    .
Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working    .
Decisions about whether to continue , change , or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests    .
Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended    .
The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred ( come back )    .
These tests are sometimes called follow - up tests or check - ups    .

What is (are) AIDS-Related Lymphoma ?

Key Points
- AIDS - related lymphoma is a disease in which malignant ( cancer ) cells form in the lymph system of patients who have acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS )    .
- There are many different types of lymphoma    .
- Signs of AIDS - related lymphoma include weight loss , fever , and night sweats    .
- Tests that examine the lymph system and other parts of the body are used to help detect ( find ) and diagnose AIDS - related lymphoma    .
- Certain factors affect prognosis ( chance of recovery ) and treatment options    .
AIDS - related lymphoma is a disease in which malignant ( cancer ) cells form in the lymph system of patients who have acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS )    .
AIDS is caused by the human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) , which attacks and weakens the body 's immune system    .
The immune system is then unable to fight infection and disease    .
People with HIV disease have an increased risk of infection and lymphoma or other types of cancer    .
A person with HIV disease who develops certain types of infections or cancer is then diagnosed with AIDS    .
Sometimes , people are diagnosed with AIDS and AIDS - related lymphoma at the same time    .
For information about AIDS and its treatment , please see the AIDSinfo website    .
AIDS - related lymphoma is a type of cancer that affects the lymph system , which is part of the body 's immune system    .
The immune system protects the body from foreign substances , infection , and diseases    .
The lymph system is made up of the following : - Lymph : Colorless , watery fluid that carries white blood cells called lymphocytes through the lymph system    .
Lymphocytes protect the body against infections and the growth of tumors    .
- Lymph vessels : A network of thin tubes that collect lymph from different parts of the body and return it to the bloodstream    .
- Lymph nodes : Small , bean - shaped structures that filter lymph and store white blood cells that help fight infection and disease    .
Lymph nodes are located along the network of lymph vessels found throughout the body    .
Clusters of lymph nodes are found in the neck , underarm , abdomen , pelvis , and groin    .
- Spleen :
An organ that makes lymphocytes , filters the blood , stores blood cells , and destroys old blood cells    .
The spleen is on the left side of the abdomen near the stomach    .
- Thymus :
An organ in which lymphocytes grow and multiply    .
The thymus is in the chest behind the breastbone    .
- Tonsils :
Two small masses of lymph tissue at the back of the throat    .
The tonsils make lymphocytes    .
- Bone marrow :
The soft , spongy tissue in the center of large bones    .
Bone marrow makes white blood cells , red blood cells , and platelets    .
Lymph tissue is also found in other parts of the body such as the brain , stomach , thyroid gland , and skin    .
Sometimes AIDS - related lymphoma occurs outside the lymph nodes in the bone marrow , liver , meninges ( thin membranes that cover the brain ) and gastrointestinal tract    .
Less often , it may occur in the anus , heart , bile duct , gingiva , and muscles    .
There are many different types of lymphoma    .
Lymphomas are divided into two general types : - Hodgkin lymphoma    .    - Non-Hodgkin lymphoma    .
Both Hodgkin lymphoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma may occur in patients with AIDS , but non-Hodgkin lymphoma is more common    .
When a person with AIDS has non-Hodgkin lymphoma , it is called AIDS - related lymphoma    .
When AIDS - related lymphoma occurs in the central nervous system ( CNS ) , it is called AIDS - related primary CNS lymphoma    .
Non-Hodgkin lymphomas are grouped by the way their cells look under a microscope    .
They may be indolent ( slow - growing ) or aggressive ( fast - growing )    .
AIDS - related lymphomas are aggressive    .
There are two main types of AIDS - related non-Hodgkin lymphoma : - Diffuse large B - cell lymphoma ( including B- cell immunoblastic lymphoma )    .
- Burkitt or Burkitt - like lymphoma    .
For more information about lymphoma or AIDS - related cancers , see the following PDQ summaries : - Adult Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Treatment - Childhood Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Treatment - Primary CNS Lymphoma Treatment - Kaposi Sarcoma Treatment
What are the symptoms of AIDS-Related Lymphoma ?

Signs of AIDS - related lymphoma include weight loss , fever , and night sweats    .
These and other signs and symptoms may be caused by AIDS - related lymphoma or by other conditions    .
Check with your doctor if you have any of the following : - Weight loss or fever for no known reason    .
- Night sweats    .
- Painless , swollen lymph nodes in the neck , chest , underarm , or groin    .    - A feeling of fullness below the ribs    .
How to diagnose AIDS-Related Lymphoma ?

Tests that examine the lymph system and other parts of the body are used to help detect ( find ) and diagnose AIDS - related lymphoma    .
The following tests and procedures may be used : - Physical exam and history :
An exam of the body to check general signs of health , including checking for signs of disease , such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual    .
A history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken    .
- Complete blood count ( CBC ) : A procedure in which a sample of blood is drawn and checked for the following : - The number of red blood cells , white blood cells , and platelets    .
- The amount of hemoglobin ( the protein that carries oxygen ) in the red blood cells    .
- The portion of the sample made up of red blood cells    .
- HIV test :
A test to measure the level of HIV antibodies in a sample of blood    .
Antibodies are made by the body when it is invaded by a foreign substance    .
A high level of HIV antibodies may mean the body has been infected with HIV    .
- Lymph node biopsy :
The removal of all or part of a lymph node    .
A pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells    .
One of the following types of biopsies may be done : - Excisional biopsy :
The removal of an entire lymph node    .
- Incisional biopsy :
The removal of part of a lymph node    .
- Core biopsy :
The removal of tissue from a lymph node using a wide needle    .
- Fine - needle aspiration ( FNA ) biopsy :
The removal of tissue from a lymph node using a thin needle    .
- Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy :
The removal of bone marrow and a small piece of bone by inserting a hollow needle into the hipbone or breastbone    .
A pathologist views the bone marrow and bone under a microscope to look for signs of cancer    .
- Chest x-ray :
An x-ray of the organs and bones inside the chest    .
An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film , making a picture of areas inside the body    .
What is the outlook for AIDS-Related Lymphoma ?

Certain factors affect prognosis ( chance of recovery ) and treatment options    .
The prognosis ( chance of recovery ) and treatment options depend on the following : - The stage of the cancer    .    - The age of the patient    .    - The number of CD4 lymphocytes ( a type of white blood cell ) in the blood    .
- The number of places in the body lymphoma is found outside the lymph system    .
- Whether the patient has a history of intravenous ( IV ) drug use    .
- The patient 's ability to carry out regular daily activities    .
What are the stages of AIDS-Related Lymphoma ?

Key Points
- After AIDS - related lymphoma has been diagnosed , tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the lymph system or to other parts of the body    .
- There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body    .
- Stages of AIDS - related lymphoma may include E and S   .    - The following stages are used for AIDS - related lymphoma : - Stage I - Stage II - Stage III - Stage IV - For treatment , AIDS - related lymphomas are grouped based on where they started in the body , as follows : - Peripheral / systemic lymphoma - Primary CNS lymphoma
After AIDS - related lymphoma has been diagnosed , tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the lymph system or to other parts of the body    .
The process used to find out if cancer cells have spread within the lymph system or to other parts of the body is called staging    .
The information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease    .
It is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment , but AIDS - related lymphoma is usually advanced when it is diagnosed    .
The following tests and procedures may be used in the staging process : - Blood chemistry studies :
A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body    .
An unusual ( higher or lower than normal ) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease    .
The blood sample will be checked for the level of LDH ( lactate dehydrogenase )    .
- CT scan ( CAT scan ) : A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body , such as the lung , lymph nodes , and liver , taken from different angles    .
The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine    .
A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly    .
This procedure is also called computed tomography , computerized tomography , or computerized axial tomography    .
- PET scan ( positron emission tomography scan ) : A procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body    .
A small amount of radioactive glucose ( sugar ) is injected into a vein    .
The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body    .
Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do    .
- MRI ( magnetic resonance imaging ) with gadolinium :
A procedure that uses a magnet , radio waves , and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body    .
A substance called gadolinium is injected into the patient through a vein    .
The gadolinium collects around the cancer cells so they show up brighter in the picture    .
This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging ( NMRI )    .
- Lumbar puncture : A procedure used to collect cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) from the spinal column    .

This is done by placing a needle between two bones in the spine and into the CSF around the spinal cord and removing a sample of the fluid    .
The sample of CSF is checked under a microscope for signs that the cancer has spread to the brain and spinal cord    .
The sample may also be checked for Epstein - Barr virus    .
This procedure is also called an LP or spinal tap    .
There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body    .
Cancer can spread through tissue , the lymph system , and the blood : - Tissue    .
The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas    .
- Lymph system    .
The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system    .
The cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body    .
- Blood    .
The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood    .
The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body    .
Stages of AIDS - related lymphoma may include E and S    .
AIDS - related lymphoma may be described as follows : - E : &quot ; E&quot ; stands for extranodal and means the cancer is found in an area or organ other than the lymph nodes or has spread to tissues beyond , but near , the major lymphatic areas    .
- S : &quot ; S&quot ; stands for spleen and means the cancer is found in the spleen    .
The following stages are used for AIDS - related lymphoma :
Stage I Stage I AIDS - related lymphoma is divided into stage I and stage IE    .
- Stage I : Cancer is found in one lymphatic area ( lymph node group , tonsils and nearby tissue , thymus , or spleen )    .
- Stage IE : Cancer is found in one organ or area outside the lymph nodes    .
Stage II Stage II AIDS - related lymphoma is divided into stage II and stage IIE    .
- Stage II : Cancer is found in two or more lymph node groups either above or below the diaphragm ( the thin muscle below the lungs that helps breathing and separates the chest from the abdomen )    .
- Stage IIE : Cancer is found in one or more lymph node groups either above or below the diaphragm    .
Cancer is also found outside the lymph nodes in one organ or area on the same side of the diaphragm as the affected lymph nodes    .
Stage III Stage III AIDS - related lymphoma is divided into stage III , stage IIIE , stage IIIS , and stage IIIE+S   .    - Stage III : Cancer is found in lymph node groups above and below the diaphragm ( the thin muscle below the lungs that helps breathing and separates the chest from the abdomen )    .
- Stage IIIE : Cancer is found in lymph node groups above and below the diaphragm and outside the lymph nodes in a nearby organ or area    .
- Stage IIIS : Cancer is found in lymph node groups above and below the diaphragm , and in the spleen    .
- Stage IIIE+S : Cancer is found in lymph node groups above and below the diaphragm , outside the lymph nodes in a nearby organ or area , and in the spleen    .
Stage IV
In stage IV AIDS - related lymphoma , the cancer : - is found throughout one or more organs that are not part of a lymphatic area ( lymph node group , tonsils and nearby tissue , thymus , or spleen ) and may be in lymph nodes near those organs ; or - is found in one organ that is not part of a lymphatic area and has spread to organs or lymph nodes far away from that organ ; or - is found in the liver , bone marrow , cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) , or lungs ( other than cancer that has spread to the lungs from nearby areas )    .
Patients who are infected with the Epstein - Barr virus or whose AIDS - related lymphoma affects the bone marrow have an increased risk of the cancer spreading to the central nervous system ( CNS )    .
For treatment , AIDS - related lymphomas are grouped based on where they started in the body , as follows :
Peripheral / systemic lymphoma Lymphoma that starts in the lymph system or elsewhere in the body , other than the brain , is called peripheral / systemic lymphoma    .
It may spread throughout the body , including to the brain or bone marrow    .
It is often diagnosed in an advanced stage    .
Primary CNS lymphoma Primary CNS lymphoma starts in the central nervous system ( brain and spinal cord )    .
It is linked to the Epstein - Barr virus    .
Lymphoma that starts somewhere else in the body and spreads to the central nervous system is not primary CNS lymphoma    .
What are the treatments for AIDS-Related Lymphoma ?

Key Points
- There are different types of treatment for patients with AIDS - related lymphoma    .
- Treatment of AIDS - related lymphoma combines treatment of the lymphoma with treatment for AIDS    .
- Four types of standard treatment are used : - Chemotherapy - Radiation therapy - High - dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant - Targeted therapy - New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials    .
- Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
- Patients can enter clinical trials before , during , or after starting their cancer treatment    .
- Follow - up tests may be needed    .
There are different types of treatment for patients with AIDS - related lymphoma    .
Different types of treatment are available for patients with AIDS - related lymphoma    .
Some treatments are standard ( the currently used treatment ) , and some are being tested in clinical trials    .
A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer    .
When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment , the new treatment may become the standard treatment    .
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment    .
Treatment of AIDS - related lymphoma combines treatment of the lymphoma with treatment for AIDS    .
Patients with AIDS have weakened immune systems and treatment can cause the immune system to become even weaker    .
For this reason , treating patients who have AIDS - related lymphoma is difficult and some patients may be treated with lower doses of drugs than lymphoma patients who do not have AIDS    .
Combined antiretroviral therapy ( cART ) is used to lessen the damage to the immune system caused by HIV    .
Treatment with combined antiretroviral therapy may allow some patients with AIDS - related lymphoma to safely receive anticancer drugs in standard or higher doses    .
In these patients , treatment may work as well as it does in lymphoma patients who do not have AIDS    .
Medicine to prevent and treat infections , which can be serious , is also used    .
For more information about AIDS and its treatment , please see the AIDSinfo website    .
Four types of standard treatment are used :
Chemotherapy Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells , either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing    .
When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle , the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body ( systemic chemotherapy )    .
When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid ( intrathecal chemotherapy ) , an organ , or a body cavity such as the abdomen , the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas ( regional chemotherapy )    .
Combination chemotherapy is treatment using more than one anticancer drug    .
The way the chemotherapy is given depends on where the cancer has formed    .
Intrathecal chemotherapy may be used in patients who are more likely to have lymphoma in the central nervous system ( CNS )    .
Chemotherapy is used in the treatment of AIDS - related peripheral / systemic lymphoma    .
It is not yet known whether it is best to give combined antiretroviral therapy at the same time as chemotherapy or after chemotherapy ends    .
Colony - stimulating factors are sometimes given together with chemotherapy    .
This helps lessen the side effects chemotherapy may have on the bone marrow    .
Radiation therapy Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high - energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing    .
There are two types of radiation therapy : - External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer    .
- Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles , seeds , wires , or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer    .
The way the radiation therapy is given depends on where the cancer has formed    .
External radiation therapy is used to treat AIDS - related primary CNS lymphoma    .
High - dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant High - dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant is a way of giving high doses of chemotherapy and replacing blood - forming cells destroyed by the cancer treatment    .
Stem cells ( immature blood cells ) are removed from the blood or bone marrow of the patient or a donor and are frozen and stored    .
After the chemotherapy is completed , the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion    .
These reinfused stem cells grow into ( and restore ) the body 's blood cells    .
Targeted therapy Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells    .
Monoclonal antibody therapy is a type of targeted therapy    .
Monoclonal antibody therapy is a cancer treatment that uses antibodies made in the laboratory from a single type of immune system cell    .
These antibodies can identify substances on cancer cells or normal substances that may help cancer cells grow    .
The antibodies attach to the substances and kill the cancer cells , block their growth , or keep them from spreading    .
Monoclonal antibodies are given by infusion    .
These may be used alone or to carry drugs , toxins , or radioactive material directly to cancer cells    .
Rituximab is used in the treatment of AIDS - related peripheral / systemic lymphoma    .
New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials    .
Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website    .
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
For some patients , taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice    .
Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process    .
Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment    .
Many of today 's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials    .
Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment    .
Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future    .
Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments , they often answer important questions and help move research forward    .
Patients can enter clinical trials before , during , or after starting their cancer treatment    .
Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment    .
Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better    .
There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring ( coming back ) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment    .
Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country    .
See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials    .
These have been retrieved from NCI 's listing of clinical trials    .
Follow - up tests may be needed    .
Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated    .
Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working    .
Decisions about whether to continue , change , or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests    .
Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended    .
The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred ( come back )    .
These tests are sometimes called follow - up tests or check - ups    .
Treatment Options for AIDS - Related Lymphoma
AIDS - Related Peripheral / Systemic Lymphoma
Treatment of AIDS - related peripheral / systemic lymphoma may include the following : - Combination chemotherapy with or without targeted therapy    .
- High - dose chemotherapy and stem cell transplant , for lymphoma that has not responded to treatment or has come back    .
- Intrathecal chemotherapy for lymphoma that is likely to spread to the central nervous system ( CNS )    .
Check the list of NCI - supported cancer clinical trials that are now accepting patients with AIDS - related peripheral / systemic lymphoma    .
For more specific results , refine the search by using other search features , such as the location of the trial , the type of treatment , or the name of the drug    .
Talk with your doctor about clinical trials that may be right for you    .
General information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website    .
AIDS - Related Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma

What is (are) Mycosis Fungoides and the Szary Syndrome ?

Key Points
- Mycosis fungoides and the Szary syndrome are diseases in which lymphocytes ( a type of white blood cell ) become malignant ( cancerous ) and affect the skin    .
- Mycosis fungoides and the Szary syndrome are types of cutaneous T - cell lymphoma    .    - A sign of mycosis fungoides is a red rash on the skin    .
- In the Szary syndrome , cancerous T - cells are found in the blood    .
- Tests that examine the skin and blood are used to detect ( find ) and diagnose mycosis fungoides and the Szary syndrome    .
- Certain factors affect prognosis ( chance of recovery ) and treatment options    .
Mycosis fungoides and the Szary syndrome are diseases in which lymphocytes ( a type of white blood cell ) become malignant ( cancerous ) and affect the skin    .
Normally , the bone marrow makes blood stem cells ( immature cells ) that become mature blood stem cells over time    .
A blood stem cell may become a myeloid stem cell or a lymphoid stem cell    .
A myeloid stem cell becomes a red blood cell , white blood cell , or platelet    .
A lymphoid stem cell becomes a lymphoblast and then one of three types of lymphocytes ( white blood cells ) : - B-cell lymphocytes that make antibodies to help fight infection    .
- T - cell lymphocytes that help B - lymphocytes make the antibodies that help fight infection    .
- Natural killer cells that attack cancer cells and viruses    .
In mycosis fungoides , T - cell lymphocytes become cancerous and affect the skin    .
In the Szary syndrome , cancerous T - cell lymphocytes affect the skin and are in the blood    .
Mycosis fungoides and the Szary syndrome are types of cutaneous T - cell lymphoma    .
Mycosis fungoides and the Szary syndrome are the two most common types of cutaneous T - cell lymphoma ( a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma )    .
For information about other types of skin cancer or non-Hodgkin lymphoma , see the following PDQ summaries : - Adult Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Treatment - Skin Cancer Treatment - Melanoma Treatment - Kaposi Sarcoma Treatment
In the Szary syndrome , cancerous T - cells are found in the blood    .
Also , skin all over the body is reddened , itchy , peeling , and painful    .
There may also be patches , plaques , or tumors on the skin    .
It is not known if the Szary syndrome is an advanced form of mycosis fungoides or a separate disease    .
What are the symptoms of Mycosis Fungoides and the Szary Syndrome ?

A sign of mycosis fungoides is a red rash on the skin    .
Mycosis fungoides may go through the following phases : - Premycotic phase : A scaly , red rash in areas of the body that usually are not exposed to the sun    .
This rash does not cause symptoms and may last for months or years    .
It is hard to diagnose the rash as mycosis fungoides during this phase    .
- Patch phase :
Thin , reddened , eczema - like rash    .
- Plaque phase : Small raised bumps ( papules ) or hardened lesions on the skin , which may be reddened    .
- Tumor phase : Tumors form on the skin    .
These tumors may develop ulcers and the skin may get infected    .
Check with your doctor if you have any of these signs    .
How to diagnose Mycosis Fungoides and the Szary Syndrome ?

Tests that examine the skin and blood are used to detect ( find ) and diagnose mycosis fungoides and the Szary syndrome    .
The following tests and procedures may be used : - Physical exam and history :
An exam of the body to check general signs of health , including checking for signs of disease , such as lumps , the number and type of skin lesions , or anything else that seems unusual    .
Pictures of the skin and a history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken    .
- Complete blood count with differential :
A procedure in which a sample of blood is drawn and checked for the following : - The number of red blood cells and platelets    .
- The number and type of white blood cells    .
- The amount of hemoglobin ( the protein that carries oxygen ) in the red blood cells    .
- The portion of the blood sample made up of red blood cells    .
- Peripheral blood smear :
A procedure in which a sample of blood is viewed under a microscope to count different circulating blood cells ( red blood cells , white blood cells , platelets , etc   .    ) and see whether the cells look normal    .
- Skin biopsy :
The removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope to check for signs of cancer    .
The doctor may remove a growth from the skin , which will be examined by a pathologist    .
More than one skin biopsy may be needed to diagnose mycosis fungoides    .
- Immunophenotyping :
A process used to identify cells , based on the types of antigens or markers on the surface of the cell    .
This process may include special staining of the blood cells    .
It is used to diagnose specific types of leukemia and lymphoma by comparing the cancer cells to normal cells of the immune system    .
- T - cell receptor ( TCR ) gene rearrangement test :
A laboratory test in which cells in a sample of tissue are checked to see if there is a certain change in the genes    .
This gene change can lead to too many of one kind of T - cells ( white blood cells that fight infection ) to be made    .
- Flow cytometry :
A laboratory test that measures the number of cells in a sample of blood , the percentage of live cells in a sample , and certain characteristics of cells , such as size , shape , and the presence of tumor markers on the cell surface    .
The cells are stained with a light - sensitive dye , placed in a fluid , and passed in a stream before a laser or other type of light    .
The measurements are based on how the light - sensitive dye reacts to the light    .
What is the outlook for Mycosis Fungoides and the Szary Syndrome ?

Certain factors affect prognosis ( chance of recovery ) and treatment options    .
The prognosis ( chance of recovery ) and treatment options depend on the following : - The stage of the cancer    .    - The type of lesion ( patches , plaques , or tumors )    .
Mycosis fungoides and the Szary syndrome are hard to cure    .
Treatment is usually palliative , to relieve symptoms and improve the quality of life    .
Patients with early stage disease may live many years    .
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Mycosis Fungoides and the Szary Syndrome ?

Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
For some patients , taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice    .
Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process    .
Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment    .
Many of today 's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials    .
Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment    .
Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future    .
Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments , they often answer important questions and help move research forward    .
Patients can enter clinical trials before , during , or after starting their cancer treatment    .
Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment    .
Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better    .

What are the stages of Mycosis Fungoides and the Szary Syndrome ?

Key Points
- After mycosis fungoides and the Szary syndrome have been diagnosed , tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread from the skin to other parts of the body    .
- There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body    .
- Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body    .
- The following stages are used for mycosis fungoides and the Szary syndrome : - Stage I Mycosis Fungoides - Stage II Mycosis Fungoides - Stage III Mycosis Fungoides - Stage IV Mycosis Fungoides - Stage IV Szary Syndrome
After mycosis fungoides and the Szary syndrome have been diagnosed , tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread from the skin to other parts of the body    .
The process used to find out if cancer has spread from the skin to other parts of the body is called staging    .
The information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease    .
It is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment    .
The following procedures may be used in the staging process : - Chest x-ray :
An x-ray of the organs and bones inside the chest    .
An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film , making a picture of areas inside the body    .
- CT scan ( CAT scan ) : A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body , such as the lymph nodes , chest , abdomen , and pelvis , taken from different angles    .
The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine    .
A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly    .
This procedure is also called computed tomography , computerized tomography , or computerized axial tomography    .
- PET scan ( positron emission tomography scan ) : A procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body    .
A small amount of radioactive glucose ( sugar ) is injected into a vein    .
The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body    .
Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do    .
- Lymph node biopsy :
The removal of all or part of a lymph node    .
A pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells    .
- Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy :
The removal of bone marrow and a small piece of bone by inserting a hollow needle into the hipbone or breastbone    .
A pathologist views the bone marrow and bone under a microscope to look for signs of cancer    .
There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body    .
Cancer can spread through tissue , the lymph system , and the blood : - Tissue    .
The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas    .
- Lymph system    .
The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system    .
The cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body    .
- Blood    .
The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood    .
The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body    .
Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body    .
When cancer spreads to another part of the body , it is called metastasis    .
Cancer cells break away from where they began ( the primary tumor ) and travel through the lymph system or blood    .
- Lymph system    .
The cancer gets into the lymph system , travels through the lymph vessels , and forms a tumor ( metastatic tumor ) in another part of the body    .
- Blood    .
The cancer gets into the blood , travels through the blood vessels , and forms a tumor ( metastatic tumor ) in another part of the body    .
The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor    .
For example , if mycosis fungoides spreads to the liver , the cancer cells in the liver are actually mycosis fungoides cells    .
The disease is metastatic mycosis fungoides , not liver cancer    .
The following stages are used for mycosis fungoides and the Szary syndrome :
Stage I Mycosis Fungoides Stage I is divided into stage IA and stage IB as follows : - Stage IA : Less than 10 % of the skin surface is covered with patches , papules , and / or plaques    .
- Stage IB : Ten percent or more of the skin surface is covered with patches , papules , and / or plaques    .
There may be abnormal lymphocytes in the blood but they are not cancerous    .
Stage II Mycosis Fungoides Stage II is divided into stage IIA and stage IIB as follows : - Stage IIA : Any amount of the skin surface is covered with patches , papules , and / or plaques    .
Lymph nodes are enlarged but cancer has not spread to them    .
- Stage IIB : One or more tumors that are 1 centimeter or larger are found on the skin    .
Lymph nodes may be enlarged but cancer has not spread to them    .
There may be abnormal lymphocytes in the blood but they are not cancerous    .
Stage III Mycosis Fungoides
In stage III , nearly all of the skin is reddened and may have patches , papules , plaques , or tumors    .
Lymph nodes may be enlarged but cancer has not spread to them    .
There may be abnormal lymphocytes in the blood but they are not cancerous    .
Stage IV Mycosis Fungoides Stage IV is divided into stage IVA and stage IVB as follows : - Stage IVA : Most of the skin is reddened and any amount of the skin surface is covered with patches , papules , plaques , or tumors , and either : - cancer has spread to lymph nodes and there may be cancerous lymphocytes in the blood ; or - there are cancerous lymphocytes in the blood and lymph nodes may be enlarged , but cancer has not spread to them    .
- Stage IVB : Most of the skin is reddened and any amount of the skin surface is covered with patches , papules , plaques , or tumors    .
Cancer has spread to other organs in the body    .
Lymph nodes may be enlarged and cancer may have spread to them    .
There may be cancerous lymphocytes in the blood    .
Stage IV Szary Syndrome
In stage IV : - Most of the skin is reddened and covered with patches , papules , plaques , or tumors ; and - There is a high level of cancerous lymphocytes in the blood ; and - Lymph nodes may be enlarged and cancer may have spread to them    .
What are the treatments for Mycosis Fungoides and the Szary Syndrome ?

Key Points
- There are different types of treatment for patients with mycosis fungoides and the Szary syndrome cancer    .
- Six types of standard treatment are used : - Photodynamic therapy - Radiation therapy - Chemotherapy - Other drug therapy - Biologic therapy - Targeted therapy - New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials    .
- High - dose chemotherapy and radiation therapy with stem cell transplant - Treatment for mycosis fungoides and the Szary syndrome may cause side effects    .
- Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
- Patients can enter clinical trials before , during , or after starting their cancer treatment    .
- Follow - up tests may be needed    .
There are different types of treatment for patients with mycosis fungoides and the Szary syndrome cancer    .
Different types of treatment are available for patients with mycosis fungoides and the Szary syndrome    .
Some treatments are standard ( the currently used treatment ) , and some are being tested in clinical trials    .
A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer    .
When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment , the new treatment may become the standard treatment    .
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment    .
Six types of standard treatment are used :
Photodynamic therapy Photodynamic therapy is a cancer treatment that uses a drug and a certain type of laser light to kill cancer cells    .
A drug that is not active until it is exposed to light is injected into a vein    .
The drug collects more in cancer cells than in normal cells    .
For skin cancer , laser light is shined onto the skin and the drug becomes active and kills the cancer cells    .
Photodynamic therapy causes little damage to healthy tissue    .
Patients undergoing photodynamic therapy will need to limit the amount of time spent in sunlight    .
In one type of photodynamic therapy , called psoralen and ultraviolet A ( PUVA ) therapy , the patient receives a drug called psoralen and then ultraviolet radiation is directed to the skin    .
In another type of photodynamic therapy , called extracorporeal photochemotherapy , the patient is given drugs and then some blood cells are taken from the body , put under a special ultraviolet A light , and put back into the body    .
Radiation therapy Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high - energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing    .
There are two types of radiation therapy : - External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer    .
- Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles , seeds , wires , or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer    .
The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated    .
External radiation therapy is used to treat mycosis fungoides and the Szary syndrome , and may also be used as palliative therapy to relieve symptoms and improve quality of life    .
Sometimes , total skin electron beam ( TSEB ) radiation therapy is used to treat mycosis fungoides and the Szary syndrome    .
This is a type of external radiation treatment in which a radiation therapy machine aims electrons ( tiny , invisible particles ) at the skin covering the whole body    .
Ultraviolet B ( UVB ) radiation therapy uses a special lamp or laser that directs UVB radiation at the skin    .
Chemotherapy Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells , either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing    .
When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle , the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body ( systemic chemotherapy )    .
When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid , an organ , or a body cavity such as the abdomen , the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas ( regional chemotherapy )    .
Sometimes the chemotherapy is topical ( put on the skin in a cream , lotion , or ointment )    .
The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated    .
See Drugs Approved for Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma for more information    .
( Mycosis fungoides and the Szary syndrome are types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma    .    )
Other drug therapy Topical corticosteroids are used to relieve red , swollen , and inflamed skin    .
They are a type of steroid    .
Topical corticosteroids may be in a cream , lotion , or ointment    .
Retinoids , such as bexarotene , are drugs related to vitamin A that can slow the growth of certain types of cancer cells    .
The retinoids may be taken by mouth or put on the skin    .
See Drugs Approved for Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma for more information    .
( Mycosis fungoides and the Szary syndrome are types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma    .    )
Biologic therapy Biologic therapy is a treatment that uses the patient 's immune system to fight cancer    .
Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost , direct , or restore the body 's natural defenses against cancer    .
This type of cancer treatment is also called biotherapy or immunotherapy    .
Interferon is a type of biologic therapy used to treat mycosis fungoides and the Szary syndrome    .
It interferes with the division of cancer cells and can slow tumor growth    .
See Drugs Approved for Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma for more information    .
( Mycosis fungoides and the Szary syndrome are types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma    .    )
Targeted therapy Targeted therapy is a treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells    .
Monoclonal antibody therapy and other types of targeted therapies are used to treat mycosis fungoides and the Szary syndrome    .
Alemtuzumab is a monoclonal antibody used to treat mycosis fungoides and the Szary syndrome    .
Monoclonal antibody therapy uses antibodies made in the laboratory , from a single type of immune system cell    .
These antibodies can identify substances on cancer cells or normal substances that may help cancer cells grow    .
The antibodies attach to the substances and kill the cancer cells , block their growth , or keep them from spreading    .
Monoclonal antibodies are given by infusion    .
They may be used alone or to carry drugs , toxins , or radioactive material directly to cancer cells    .
Other types of monoclonal antibody therapy are being studied in clinical trials to treat mycosis fungoides and the Szary syndrome    .
Vorinostat and romidepsin are two of the histone deacetylase ( HDAC ) inhibitors used to treat mycosis fungoides and the Szary syndrome    .
HDAC inhibitors cause a chemical change that stops tumor cells from dividing    .
Pralatrexate is a dihydrofolate reductase ( DHFR ) inhibitor used to treat mycosis fungoides and the Szary syndrome    .
It builds up in cancer cells and stops them from using folate , a nutrient needed for cells to divide    .
Pralatrexate may slow the growth of tumors and kill cancer cells    .
See Drugs Approved for Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma for more information    .
( Mycosis fungoides and the Szary syndrome are types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma    .    )
New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials    .
This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials    .
It may not mention every new treatment being studied    .
Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website    .
High - dose chemotherapy and radiation therapy with stem cell transplant
This treatment is a method of giving high doses of chemotherapy and radiation therapy and replacing blood - forming cells destroyed by the cancer treatment    .
Stem cells ( immature blood cells ) are removed from the bone marrow or blood of the patient or a donor and are frozen and stored    .
After therapy is completed , the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion    .
These reinfused stem cells grow into ( and restore ) the body 's blood cells    .
Treatment for mycosis fungoides and the Szary syndrome may cause side effects    .
For information about side effects caused by treatment for cancer , see our Side Effects page    .
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
For some patients , taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice    .
Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process    .
Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment    .
Many of today 's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials    .
Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment    .
Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future    .
Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments , they often answer important questions and help move research forward    .
Patients can enter clinical trials before , during , or after starting their cancer treatment    .
Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment    .
Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better    .
There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring ( coming back ) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment    .
Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country    .
See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials    .
These have been retrieved from NCI 's listing of clinical trials    .
Follow - up tests may be needed    .
Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated    .
Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working    .
Decisions about whether to continue , change , or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests    .
Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended    .
The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred ( come back )    .
These tests are sometimes called follow - up tests or check - ups    .

What is (are) Primary CNS Lymphoma ?

Key Points
- Primary central nervous system ( CNS ) lymphoma is a disease in which malignant ( cancer ) cells form in the lymph tissue of the brain and / or spinal cord    .
- Having a weakened immune system may increase the risk of developing primary CNS lymphoma    .
- Tests that examine the eyes , brain , and spinal cord are used to detect ( find ) and diagnose primary CNS lymphoma    .
- Certain factors affect prognosis ( chance of recovery ) and treatment options    .
Primary central nervous system ( CNS ) lymphoma is a disease in which malignant ( cancer ) cells form in the lymph tissue of the brain and / or spinal cord    .
Lymphoma is a disease in which malignant ( cancer ) cells form in the lymph system    .
The lymph system is part of the immune system and is made up of the lymph , lymph vessels , lymph nodes , spleen , thymus , tonsils , and bone marrow    .
Lymphocytes ( carried in the lymph ) travel in and out of the central nervous system ( CNS )    .
It is thought that some of these lymphocytes become malignant and cause lymphoma to form in the CNS    .
Primary CNS lymphoma can start in the brain , spinal cord , or meninges ( the layers that form the outer covering of the brain )    .
Because the eye is so close to the brain , primary CNS lymphoma can also start in the eye ( called ocular lymphoma )    .
Who is at risk for Primary CNS Lymphoma? ?

Having a weakened immune system may increase the risk of developing primary CNS lymphoma    .
Anything that increases your chance of getting a disease is called a risk factor    .
Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer ; not having risk factors doesnt mean that you will not get cancer    .
Talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk    .
Primary CNS lymphoma may occur in patients who have acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) or other disorders of the immune system or who have had a kidney transplant    .
For more information about lymphoma in patients with AIDS , see the PDQ summary on AIDS - Related Lymphoma Treatment    .
How to diagnose Primary CNS Lymphoma ?

Tests that examine the eyes , brain , and spinal cord are used to detect ( find ) and diagnose primary CNS lymphoma    .
The following tests and procedures may be used : - Physical exam and history :
-शारीरिक परीक्षण और इतिहास :
An exam of the body to check general signs of health , including checking for signs of disease , such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual    .
A history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken    .
- Neurological exam :
A series of questions and tests to check the brain , spinal cord , and nerve function    .
The exam checks a persons mental status , coordination , ability to walk normally , and how well the muscles , senses , and reflexes work    .
This may also be called a neuro exam or a neurologic exam    .
- Slit - lamp eye exam :
An exam that uses a special microscope with a bright , narrow slit of light to check the outside and inside of the eye    .
- MRI ( magnetic resonance imaging ) : A procedure that uses a magnet , radio waves , and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the brain and spinal cord    .
A substance called gadolinium is injected into the patient through a vein    .
The gadolinium collects around the cancer cells so they show up brighter in the picture    .
This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging ( NMRI )    .
- PET scan ( positron emission tomography scan ) : A procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body    .
A small amount of radioactive glucose ( sugar ) is injected into a vein    .
The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body    .
Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do    .
- Lumbar puncture : A procedure used to collect cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) from the spinal column    .
This is done by placing a needle between two bones in the spine and into the CSF around the spinal cord and removing a sample of the fluid    .
The sample of CSF is checked under a microscope for signs of tumor cells    .
The sample may also be checked for the amounts of protein and glucose    .
A higher than normal amount of protein or lower than normal amount of glucose may be a sign of a tumor    .
This procedure is also called an LP or spinal tap    .
- Stereotactic biopsy : A biopsy procedure that uses a computer and a 3 - dimensional ( 3 - D ) scanning device to find a tumor site and guide the removal of tissue so it can be viewed under a microscope to check for signs of cancer    .
The following tests may be done on the samples of tissue that are removed : - Flow cytometry :
A laboratory test that measures the number of cells in a sample , the percentage of live cells in a sample , and certain characteristics of cells , such as size , shape , and the presence of tumor markers on the cell surface    .
The cells are stained with a light - sensitive dye , placed in a fluid , and passed in a stream before a laser or other type of light    .
The measurements are based on how the light - sensitive dye reacts to the light    .
- Immunohistochemistry :
A test that uses antibodies to check for certain antigens in a sample of tissue    .
The antibody is usually linked to a radioactive substance or a dye that causes the tissue to light up under a microscope    .
This type of test may be used to tell the difference between different types of cancer    .
- Cytogenetic analysis : A laboratory test in which cells in a sample of tissue are viewed under a microscope to look for certain changes in the chromosomes    .
Other tests , such as fluorescence in situ hybridization ( FISH ) , may also be done to look for certain changes in the chromosomes    .
- Complete blood count ( CBC ) with differential :
A procedure in which a sample of blood is drawn and checked for the following : - The number of red blood cells and platelets    .
- The number and type of white blood cells    .
- The amount of hemoglobin ( the protein that carries oxygen ) in the red blood cells    .
- The portion of the blood sample made up of red blood cells    .
- Blood chemistry studies :
A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body    .
An unusual ( higher or lower than normal ) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease    .
What is the outlook for Primary CNS Lymphoma ?

Certain factors affect prognosis ( chance of recovery ) and treatment options    .
The prognosis ( chance of recovery ) depends on the following : - The patient 's age and general health    .
- The level of certain substances in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF )    .    - Where the tumor is in the central nervous system , eye , or both    .
- Whether the patient has AIDS    .
Treatment options depend on the following : - The stage of the cancer    .    - Where the tumor is in the central nervous system    .
- The patient 's age and general health    .
- Whether the cancer has just been diagnosed or has recurred ( come back )    .
Treatment of primary CNS lymphoma works best when the tumor has not spread outside the cerebrum ( the largest part of the brain ) and the patient is younger than 60 years , able to carry out most daily activities , and does not have AIDS or other diseases that weaken the immune system    .
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Primary CNS Lymphoma ?

New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials    .
This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials    .
It may not mention every new treatment being studied    .

Stem cells ( immature blood cells ) are removed from the blood or bone marrow of the patient or a donor and are frozen and stored    .
After the chemotherapy is completed , the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion    .
These reinfused stem cells grow into ( and restore ) the body 's blood cells    .
Targeted therapy Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to attack cancer cells    .
Targeted therapies usually cause less harm to normal cells than chemotherapy or radiation therapy do    .
Monoclonal antibody therapy is one type of targeted therapy being studied in the treatment of primary CNS lymphoma    .
Monoclonal antibody therapy is a cancer treatment that uses antibodies made in the laboratory from a single type of immune system cell    .
These antibodies can identify substances on cancer cells or normal substances that may help cancer cells grow    .
The antibodies attach to the substances and kill the cancer cells , block their growth , or keep them from spreading    .
Monoclonal antibodies are given by infusion    .
They may be used alone or to carry drugs , toxins , or radioactive material directly to cancer cells    .

When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment , the new treatment may become the standard treatment    .
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment    .
Surgery is not used to treat primary CNS lymphoma    .
Three standard treatments are used :
Radiation therapy Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high - energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing    .
There are two types of radiation therapy : - External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer    .
Because primary CNS lymphoma spreads throughout the brain , external radiation therapy is given to the whole brain    .
This is called whole brain radiation therapy    .
- Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles , seeds , wires , or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer    .
The way the radiation therapy is given depends on whether the patient has primary CNS lymphoma and AIDS    .
External radiation therapy is used to treat primary CNS lymphoma    .
High - dose radiation therapy to the brain can damage healthy tissue and cause disorders that can affect thinking , learning , problem solving , speech , reading , writing , and memory    .
Clinical trials have tested the use of chemotherapy alone or before radiation therapy to reduce the damage to healthy brain tissue that occurs with the use of radiation therapy    .
Chemotherapy Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells , either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing    .
When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle , the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body ( systemic chemotherapy )    .
When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid ( intrathecal chemotherapy ) , an organ , or a body cavity such as the abdomen , the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas ( regional chemotherapy )    .
The way the chemotherapy is given depends on where the tumor is in the CNS or eye    .
Primary CNS lymphoma may be treated with systemic chemotherapy , intrathecal chemotherapy and / or intraventricular chemotherapy , in which anticancer drugs are placed into the ventricles ( fluid - filled cavities ) of the brain    .
If primary CNS lymphoma is found in the eye , anticancer drugs are injected directly into the vitreous humor ( jelly - like substance ) inside the eye    .
A network of blood vessels and tissue , called the blood - brain barrier , protects the brain from harmful substances    .
This barrier can also keep anticancer drugs from reaching the brain    .
In order to treat CNS lymphoma , certain drugs may be used to make openings between cells in the blood - brain barrier    .
This is called blood - brain barrier disruption    .
Anticancer drugs infused into the bloodstream may then reach the brain    .
Steroid therapy Steroids are hormones made naturally in the body    .
They can also be made in a laboratory and used as drugs    .
Glucocorticoids are steroid drugs that have an anticancer effect in lymphomas    .
New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials    .
This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials    .
It may not mention every new treatment being studied    .
Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website    .
High - dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant High - dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant is a method of giving high doses of chemotherapy and replacing blood - forming cells destroyed by the cancer treatment    .
Stem cells ( immature blood cells ) are removed from the blood or bone marrow of the patient or a donor and are frozen and stored    .
After the chemotherapy is completed , the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion    .
These reinfused stem cells grow into ( and restore ) the body 's blood cells    .
Targeted therapy Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to attack cancer cells    .
Targeted therapies usually cause less harm to normal cells than chemotherapy or radiation therapy do    .
Monoclonal antibody therapy is one type of targeted therapy being studied in the treatment of primary CNS lymphoma    .
Monoclonal antibody therapy is a cancer treatment that uses antibodies made in the laboratory from a single type of immune system cell    .
These antibodies can identify substances on cancer cells or normal substances that may help cancer cells grow    .
The antibodies attach to the substances and kill the cancer cells , block their growth , or keep them from spreading    .
Monoclonal antibodies are given by infusion    .
They may be used alone or to carry drugs , toxins , or radioactive material directly to cancer cells    .
Rituximab is a type of monoclonal antibody used to treat newly diagnosed primary CNS lymphoma in patients who do not have AIDS    .
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
For some patients , taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice    .
Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process    .
Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment    .
Many of today 's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials    .
Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment    .
Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future    .
Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments , they often answer important questions and help move research forward    .
Patients can enter clinical trials before , during , or after starting their cancer treatment    .
Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment    .
Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better    .
There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring ( coming back ) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment    .
Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country    .
See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials    .
These have been retrieved from NCI 's listing of clinical trials    .
Follow - up tests may be needed    .
Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated    .
Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working    .
Decisions about whether to continue , change , or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests    .
Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended    .
The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred ( come back )    .
These tests are sometimes called follow - up tests or check - ups    .

What is (are) Childhood Hodgkin Lymphoma ?

Key Points
- Childhood Hodgkin lymphoma is a disease in which malignant ( cancer ) cells form in the lymph system    .
- There are two types of childhood Hodgkin lymphoma    .
- Epstein - Barr virus infection increases the risk of childhood Hodgkin lymphoma    .
- Signs of childhood Hodgkin lymphoma include swollen lymph nodes , fever , night sweats , and weight loss    .
- Tests that examine the lymph system are used to detect ( find ) and diagnose childhood Hodgkin lymphoma    .
- Certain factors affect prognosis ( chance of recovery ) and treatment options    .
Childhood Hodgkin lymphoma is a disease in which malignant ( cancer ) cells form in the lymph system    .
Childhood Hodgkin lymphoma is a type of cancer that develops in the lymph system , which is part of the body 's immune system    .
The immune system protects the body from foreign substances , infection , and diseases    .
The lymph system is made up of the following : - Lymph : Colorless , watery fluid that carries white blood cells called lymphocytes through the lymph system    .
Lymphocytes protect the body against infections and the growth of tumors    .
- Lymph vessels : A network of thin tubes that collect lymph from different parts of the body and return it to the bloodstream    .
- Lymph nodes : Small , bean - shaped structures that filter lymph and store white blood cells that help fight infection and disease    .
Lymph nodes are located along the network of lymph vessels found throughout the body    .
Clusters of lymph nodes are found in the neck , underarm , abdomen , pelvis , and groin    .
- Spleen :
An organ that makes lymphocytes , filters the blood , stores blood cells , and destroys old blood cells    .
The spleen is on the left side of the abdomen near the stomach    .
- Thymus :
An organ in which lymphocytes grow and multiply    .
The thymus is in the chest behind the breastbone    .
- Tonsils :
Two small masses of lymph tissue at the back of the throat    .
The tonsils make lymphocytes    .
- Bone marrow :
The soft , spongy tissue in the center of large bones    .
Bone marrow makes white blood cells , red blood cells , and platelets    .
Lymph tissue is also found in other parts of the body such as the stomach , thyroid gland , brain , and skin    .
There are two general types of lymphoma : Hodgkin lymphoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma    .
( See the PDQ summary on Childhood Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Treatment for more information    .    )
Hodgkin lymphoma often occurs in adolescents 15 to 19 years of age    .
The treatment for children and adolescents is different than treatment for adults    .
( See the PDQ summary on Adult Hodgkin Lymphoma Treatment for more information    .    )
There are two types of childhood Hodgkin lymphoma    .
The two types of childhood Hodgkin lymphoma are : - Classical Hodgkin lymphoma    .    - Nodular lymphocyte - predominant Hodgkin lymphoma    .
Classical Hodgkin lymphoma is divided into four subtypes , based on how the cancer cells look under a microscope : - Lymphocyte - rich classical Hodgkin lymphoma    .
- Nodular sclerosis Hodgkin lymphoma    .    - Mixed cellularity Hodgkin lymphoma    .
- Lymphocyte - depleted Hodgkin lymphoma    .
Who is at risk for Childhood Hodgkin Lymphoma? ?

Epstein - Barr virus infection increases the risk of childhood Hodgkin lymphoma    .
Anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor    .
Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer ; not having risk factors doesnt mean that you will not get cancer    .
Talk with your childs doctor if you think your child may be at risk    .
Risk factors for childhood Hodgkin lymphoma include the following : - Being infected with the Epstein - Barr virus    .
- Being infected with the human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV )    .
- Having certain diseases of the immune system    .
- Having a personal history of mononucleosis ( &quot; mono&quot ; )    .
- Having a parent or sibling with a personal history of Hodgkin lymphoma    .
Being exposed to common infections in early childhood may decrease the risk of Hodgkin lymphoma in children because of the effect it has on the immune system    .
What are the symptoms of Childhood Hodgkin Lymphoma ?

Signs of childhood Hodgkin lymphoma include swollen lymph nodes , fever , night sweats , and weight loss    .
These and other signs and symptoms may be caused by childhood Hodgkin lymphoma or by other conditions    .
Check with your child 's doctor if your child has any of the following : - Painless , swollen lymph nodes near the collarbone or in the neck , chest , underarm , or groin    .
- Fever for no known reason    .
- Weight loss for no known reason    .
- Night sweats    .
- Fatigue    .    - Anorexia    .    - Itchy skin    .
- Pain in the lymph nodes after drinking alcohol    .
Fever , weight loss , and night sweats are called B symptoms    .
How to diagnose Childhood Hodgkin Lymphoma ?

Tests that examine the lymph system are used to detect ( find ) and diagnose childhood Hodgkin lymphoma    .
The following tests and procedures may be used : - Physical exam and history :
An exam of the body to check general signs of health , including checking for signs of disease , such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual    .
A history of the patient 's health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken    .
- CT scan ( CAT scan ) : A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body , such as the neck , chest , abdomen , or pelvis , taken from different angles    .
The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine    .
A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly    .
This procedure is also called computed tomography , computerized tomography , or computerized axial tomography    .
- PET scan ( positron emission tomography scan ) : A procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body    .
A small amount of radioactive glucose ( sugar ) is injected into a vein    .
The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body    .
Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do    .
Sometimes a PET scan and a CT scan are done at the same time    .
If there is any cancer , this increases the chance that it will be found    .
- Chest x-ray :
An x-ray of the organs and bones inside the chest    .
An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film , making a picture of areas inside the body    .
- Complete blood count ( CBC ) : A procedure in which a sample of blood is drawn and checked for the following : - The number of red blood cells , white blood cells , and platelets    .
- The amount of hemoglobin ( the protein that carries oxygen ) in the red blood cells    .
- The portion of the blood sample made up of red blood cells    .
- Blood chemistry studies :
A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body    .
An unusual ( higher or lower than normal ) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease    .
- Sedimentation rate : A procedure in which a sample of blood is drawn and checked for the rate at which the red blood cells settle to the bottom of the test tube    .
The sedimentation rate is a measure of how much inflammation is in the body    .
A higher than normal sedimentation rate may be a sign of lymphoma    .
Also called erythrocyte sedimentation rate , sed rate , or ESR    .
- Lymph node biopsy :
The removal of all or part of a lymph node    .
The lymph node may be removed during an image - guided CT scan or a thoracoscopy , mediastinoscopy , or laparoscopy    .
One of the following types of biopsies may be done : - Excisional biopsy :
The removal of an entire lymph node    .
- Incisional biopsy :
The removal of part of a lymph node    .
- Core biopsy :
The removal of tissue from a lymph node using a wide needle    .
- Fine - needle aspiration ( FNA ) biopsy :
The removal of tissue from a lymph node using a thin needle    .
A pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells , especially Reed - Sternberg cells    .
Reed - Sternberg cells are common in classical Hodgkin lymphoma    .
The following test may be done on tissue that was removed : - Immunophenotyping :
A laboratory test used to identify cells , based on the types of antigens or markers on the surface of the cell    .
This test is used to diagnose the specific type of lymphoma by comparing the cancer cells to normal cells of the immune system    .
What is the outlook for Childhood Hodgkin Lymphoma ?

Certain factors affect prognosis ( chance of recovery ) and treatment options    .
The prognosis ( chance of recovery ) and treatment options depend on the following : - The stage of the cancer    .    - The size of the tumor    .
- Whether there are B symptoms at diagnosis    .
- The type of Hodgkin lymphoma    .
- Certain features of the cancer cells    .
- Whether there are too many white blood cells or too few red blood cells at the time of diagnosis    .
- How well the tumor responds to initial treatment with chemotherapy    .
- Whether the cancer is newly diagnosed or has recurred ( come back )    .
The treatment options also depend on : - The child 's age and gender    .
- The risk of long - term side effects    .
Most children and adolescents with newly diagnosed Hodgkin lymphoma can be cured    .
What are the stages of Childhood Hodgkin Lymphoma ?

Key Points
- After childhood Hodgkin lymphoma has been diagnosed , tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the lymph system or to other parts of the body    .
- There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body    .
- Stages of childhood Hodgkin lymphoma may include A , B , E , and S   .    - The following stages are used for childhood Hodgkin lymphoma : - Stage I - Stage II - Stage III - Stage IV - Untreated Hodgkin lymphoma is divided into risk groups    .
After childhood Hodgkin lymphoma has been diagnosed , tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the lymph system or to other parts of the body    .
The process used to find out if cancer has spread within the lymph system or to other parts of the body is called staging    .
The information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease    .
Treatment is based on the stage and other factors that affect prognosis    .
The following tests and procedures may be used in the staging process : - CT scan ( CAT scan ) :
A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body , such as the neck , chest , abdomen , or pelvis , taken from different angles    .
The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine    .
A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly    .
This procedure is also called computed tomography , computerized tomography , or computerized axial tomography    .
- PET scan ( positron emission tomography scan ) : A procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body    .
A small amount of radioactive glucose ( sugar ) is injected into a vein    .
The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body    .
Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do    .
Sometimes a PET scan and a CT scan are done at the same time    .
If there is any cancer , this increases the chance that it will be found    .
- MRI ( magnetic resonance imaging ) : A procedure that uses a magnet , radio waves , and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body    .
This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging ( NMRI )    .
An MRI of the abdomen and pelvis may be done    .
- Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy :
The removal of bone marrow and a small piece of bone by inserting a hollow needle into the hipbone or breastbone    .
A pathologist views the bone marrow and bone under a microscope to look for abnormal cells    .
There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body    .
Cancer can spread through tissue , the lymph system , and the blood : - Tissue    .
The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas    .
- Lymph system    .
The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system    .
The cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body    .
- Blood    .
The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood    .
The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body    .
Stages of childhood Hodgkin lymphoma may include A , B , E , and S    .
Childhood Hodgkin lymphoma may be described as follows : - A : The patient does not have B symptoms ( fever , weight loss , or night sweats )    .
- B : The patient has B symptoms    .
- E : Cancer is found in an organ or tissue that is not part of the lymph system but which may be next to an area of the lymph system affected by the cancer    .
- S : Cancer is found in the spleen    .
The following stages are used for childhood Hodgkin lymphoma :
Stage I Stage I is divided into stage I and stage IE    .
- Stage I : Cancer is found in one of the following places in the lymph system : - One or more lymph nodes in one lymph node group    .
- Waldeyer 's ring    .
- Thymus    .    - Spleen    .    - Stage IE : Cancer is found outside the lymph system in one organ or area    .
Stage II Stage II is divided into stage II and stage IIE    .
- Stage II : Cancer is found in two or more lymph node groups either above or below the diaphragm ( the thin muscle below the lungs that helps breathing and separates the chest from the abdomen )    .
- Stage IIE : Cancer is found in one or more lymph node groups either above or below the diaphragm and outside the lymph nodes in a nearby organ or area    .
Stage III Stage III is divided into stage III , stage IIIE , stage IIIS , and stage IIIE , S   .    - Stage III : Cancer is found in lymph node groups above and below the diaphragm ( the thin muscle below the lungs that helps breathing and separates the chest from the abdomen )    .
- Stage IIIE : Cancer is found in lymph node groups above and below the diaphragm and outside the lymph nodes in a nearby organ or area    .
- Stage IIIS : Cancer is found in lymph node groups above and below the diaphragm , and in the spleen    .
- Stage IIIE,S : Cancer is found in lymph node groups above and below the diaphragm , outside the lymph nodes in a nearby organ or area , and in the spleen    .
Stage IV
In stage IV , the cancer : - is found outside the lymph nodes throughout one or more organs , and may be in lymph nodes near those organs ; or - is found outside the lymph nodes in one organ and has spread to areas far away from that organ ; or - is found in the lung , liver , bone marrow , or cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF )    .
The cancer has not spread to the lung , liver , bone marrow , or CSF from nearby areas    .
Untreated Hodgkin lymphoma is divided into risk groups    .
Untreated childhood Hodgkin lymphoma is divided into risk groups based on the stage , size of the tumor , and whether the patient has B symptoms ( fever , weight loss , or night sweats )    .
The risk group is used to plan treatment    .
- Low - risk childhood Hodgkin lymphoma    .
- Intermediate - risk childhood Hodgkin lymphoma    .
- High - risk childhood Hodgkin lymphoma    .
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Childhood Hodgkin Lymphoma ?

New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials    .
This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials    .
It may not mention every new treatment being studied    .
Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website    .
Proton beam radiation therapy Proton - beam therapy is a type of high - energy , external radiation therapy that uses streams of protons ( small , positively - charged particles of matter ) to make radiation    .
This type of radiation therapy may help lessen the damage to healthy tissue near the tumor    .
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
For some patients , taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice    .
Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process    .
Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment    .
Many of today 's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials    .
Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment    .
Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future    .
Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments , they often answer important questions and help move research forward    .
Patients can enter clinical trials before , during , or after starting their cancer treatment    .
Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment    .
Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better    .
There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring ( coming back ) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment    .
Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country    .
See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials    .

What are the treatments for Childhood Hodgkin Lymphoma ?

Key Points
- There are different types of treatment for children with Hodgkin lymphoma    .
- Children with Hodgkin lymphoma should have their treatment planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating childhood cancer    .
- Children and adolescents may have treatment - related side effects that appear months or years after treatment for Hodgkin lymphoma    .
- Five types of standard treatment are used : - Chemotherapy - Radiation therapy - Targeted therapy - Surgery - High - dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant - New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials    .
- Proton beam radiation therapy - Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
- Patients can enter clinical trials before , during , or after starting their cancer treatment    .
- Follow - up tests may be needed    .
There are different types of treatment for children with Hodgkin lymphoma    .
Different types of treatment are available for children with Hodgkin lymphoma    .
Some treatments are standard and some are being tested in clinical trials    .
A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer    .
When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment , the new treatment may become the standard treatment    .
Because cancer in children is rare , taking part in a clinical trial should be considered    .
Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment    .
Children with Hodgkin lymphoma should have their treatment planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating childhood cancer    .
Treatment will be overseen by a pediatric oncologist , a doctor who specializes in treating children with cancer    .
The pediatric oncologist works with other pediatric health care providers who are experts in treating children with Hodgkin lymphoma and who specialize in certain areas of medicine    .
These may include the following specialists : - Pediatrician    .    - Medical oncologist / hematologist    .
- Pediatric surgeon    .
- Radiation oncologist    .
- Endocrinologist    .
- Pediatric nurse specialist    .
- Rehabilitation specialist    .
- Psychologist    .
- Social worker    .
- Child - life specialist    .
The treatment of Hodgkin lymphoma in adolescents and young adults may be different than the treatment for children    .
Some adolescents and young adults are treated with an adult treatment regimen    .
Children and adolescents may have treatment - related side effects that appear months or years after treatment for Hodgkin lymphoma    .
Some cancer treatments cause side effects that continue or appear months or years after cancer treatment has ended    .
These are called late effects    .
Because late effects affect health and development , regular follow - up exams are important    .
Late effects of cancer treatment may include : - Physical problems that affect the following : - Development of sex and reproductive organs    .
- Fertility ( ability to have children )    .
- Bone and muscle growth and development    .
- Thyroid , heart , or lung function    .
- Teeth , gums , and salivary gland function    .
- Spleen function ( increased risk of infection )    .
- Changes in mood , feelings , thinking , learning , or memory    .
- Second cancers ( new types of cancer )    .
For female survivors of Hodgkin lymphoma , there is an increased risk of breast cancer    .
This risk depends on the amount of radiation therapy they received to the breast during treatment and the chemotherapy regimen used    .
The risk of breast cancer is decreased if these female survivors also received radiation therapy to the ovaries    .
It is suggested that female survivors who received radiation therapy to the breast have a mammogram once a year starting 8 years after treatment or at age 25 years , whichever is later    .
Female survivors of childhood Hodgkin lymphoma who have breast cancer have an increased risk of dying from the disease compared to patients with no history of Hodgkin lymphoma who have breast cancer    .
Some late effects may be treated or controlled    .
It is important to talk with your child 's doctors about the possible late effects caused by some treatments    .
( See the PDQ summary on Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer for more information )    .
Five types of standard treatment are used :
Chemotherapy Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells , either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing    .
When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle , the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body ( systemic chemotherapy )    .
When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid , an organ , or a body cavity such as the abdomen , the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas ( regional chemotherapy )    .
Combination chemotherapy is treatment using more than one anticancer drug    .
The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the risk group    .
For example , children with low - risk Hodgkin lymphoma receive fewer cycles of treatment , fewer anticancer drugs , and lower doses of anticancer drugs than children with high - risk lymphoma    .
See Drugs Approved for Hodgkin Lymphoma for more information    .
Radiation therapy Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high - energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing    .
There are two types of radiation therapy : - External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer    .
Certain ways of giving radiation therapy can help keep radiation from damaging nearby healthy tissue    .
These types of external radiation therapy include the following : - Conformal radiation therapy : Conformal radiation therapy is a type of external radiation therapy that uses a computer to make a 3 - dimensional ( 3 - D ) picture of the tumor and shapes the radiation beams to fit the tumor    .
- Intensity - modulated radiation therapy ( IMRT ) : IMRT is a type of 3 - dimensional ( 3 - D ) radiation therapy that uses a computer to make pictures of the size and shape of the tumor    .
Thin beams of radiation of different intensities ( strengths ) are aimed at the tumor from many angles    .
- Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles , seeds , wires , or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer    .
Radiation therapy may be given , based on the childs risk group and chemotherapy regimen    .
External radiation therapy is used to treat childhood Hodgkin lymphoma    .
The radiation is given only to the lymph nodes or other areas with cancer    .
Internal radiation therapy is not used to treat Hodgkin lymphoma    .
Targeted therapy Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells    .
Monoclonal antibody therapy and proteasome inhibitor therapy are being used in the treatment of childhood Hodgkin lymphoma    .
Monoclonal antibody therapy is a cancer treatment that uses antibodies made in the laboratory from a single type of immune system cell    .
These antibodies can identify substances on cancer cells or normal substances that may help cancer cells grow    .
The antibodies attach to the substances and kill the cancer cells , block their growth , or keep them from spreading    .
Monoclonal antibodies are given by infusion    .
They may be used alone or to carry drugs , toxins , or radioactive material directly to cancer cells    .
In children , rituximab may be used to treat refractory or recurrent Hodgkin lymphoma    .
Brentuximab , nivolumab , pembrolizumab , and atezolizumab are monoclonal antibodies being studied to treat children    .
Proteasome inhibitor therapy is a type of targeted therapy that blocks the action of proteasomes ( proteins that remove other proteins the body no longer needs ) in cancer cells and may prevent the growth of tumors    .
Bortezomib is a proteasome inhibitor used to treat refractory or recurrent childhood Hodgkin lymphoma    .
Surgery Surgery may be done to remove as much of the tumor as possible for localized nodular lymphocyte - predominant childhood Hodgkin lymphoma    .
High - dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant High - dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant is a way of giving high doses of chemotherapy and replacing blood - forming cells destroyed by the cancer treatment    .
Stem cells ( immature blood cells ) are removed from the blood or bone marrow of the patient or a donor and are frozen and stored    .
After the chemotherapy is completed , the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion    .
These reinfused stem cells grow into ( and restore ) the body 's blood cells    .
See Drugs Approved for Hodgkin Lymphoma for more information    .
New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials    .
This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials    .
It may not mention every new treatment being studied    .
Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website    .
Proton beam radiation therapy Proton - beam therapy is a type of high - energy , external radiation therapy that uses streams of protons ( small , positively - charged particles of matter ) to make radiation    .
This type of radiation therapy may help lessen the damage to healthy tissue near the tumor    .
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
For some patients , taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice    .
Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process    .
Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment    .
Many of today 's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials    .
Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment    .
Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future    .
Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments , they often answer important questions and help move research forward    .
Patients can enter clinical trials before , during , or after starting their cancer treatment    .
Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment    .
Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better    .
There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring ( coming back ) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment    .
Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country    .
See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials    .
These have been retrieved from NCI 's listing of clinical trials    .
Follow - up tests may be needed    .
Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated    .
Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working    .
Decisions about whether to continue , change , or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests    .
Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended    .
The results of these tests can show if your child 's condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred ( come back )    .
These tests are sometimes called follow - up tests or check - ups    .
For patients who receive chemotherapy alone , a PET scan may be done 3 weeks or more after treatment ends    .
For patients who receive radiation therapy last , a PET scan should not be done until 8 to 12 weeks after treatment    .

Childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma is a disease in which malignant ( cancer ) cells form in the lymph system    .
Childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma is a type of cancer that forms in the lymph system , which is part of the body 's immune system    .
The immune system protects the body from foreign substances , infection , and diseases    .
The lymph system is made up of the following : - Lymph : Colorless , watery fluid that carries white blood cells called lymphocytes through the lymph system    .
Lymphocytes protect the body against infections and the growth of tumors    .
There are three types of lymphocytes : - B lymphocytes that make antibodies to help fight infection    .
- T lymphocytes that help B lymphocytes make the antibodies that help fight infection    .
- Natural killer cells that attack cancer cells and viruses    .
- Lymph vessels : A network of thin tubes that collect lymph from different parts of the body and return it to the bloodstream    .
- Lymph nodes : Small , bean - shaped structures that filter lymph and store white blood cells that help fight infection and disease    .
Lymph nodes are located along the network of lymph vessels found throughout the body    .
Clusters of lymph nodes are found in the neck , underarm , abdomen , pelvis , and groin    .
- Spleen :
An organ that makes lymphocytes , filters the blood , stores blood cells , and destroys old blood cells    .
The spleen is on the left side of the abdomen near the stomach    .
- Thymus :
An organ in which lymphocytes grow and multiply    .
The thymus is in the chest behind the breastbone    .
- Tonsils :
Two small masses of lymph tissue at the back of the throat    .
The tonsils make lymphocytes    .
- Bone marrow :
The soft , spongy tissue in the center of large bones    .
Bone marrow makes white blood cells , red blood cells , and platelets    .
Non-Hodgkin lymphoma can begin in B lymphocytes , T lymphocytes , or natural killer cells    .
Lymphocytes can also be found in the blood and collect in the lymph nodes , spleen , and thymus    .
Lymph tissue is also found in other parts of the body such as the stomach , thyroid gland , brain , and skin    .
Non-Hodgkin lymphoma can occur in both adults and children    .
Treatment for children is different than treatment for adults    .
See the following PDQ summaries for information about treatment of non-Hodgkin lymphoma in adults : - Adult Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma - Primary CNS Lymphoma Treatment - Mycosis Fungoides and the Sezary Syndrome Treatment
The main types of lymphoma are Hodgkin lymphoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma    .
Lymphomas are divided into two general types : Hodgkin lymphoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma    .
This summary is about the treatment of childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma    .
See the PDQ summary on Childhood Hodgkin Lymphoma Treatment for information about childhood Hodgkin lymphoma    .
There are three major types of childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma    .
The type of lymphoma is determined by how the cells look under a microscope    .
The three major types of childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma are : Mature B- cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma Mature B- cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas include : - Burkitt and Burkitt - like lymphoma / leukemia : Burkitt lymphoma and Burkitt leukemia are different forms of the same disease    .
Burkitt lymphoma / leukemia is an aggressive ( fast - growing ) disorder of B lymphocytes that is most common in children and young adults    .
It may form in the abdomen , Waldeyer 's ring , testicles , bone , bone marrow , skin , or central nervous system ( CNS )    .
Burkitt leukemia may start in the lymph nodes as Burkitt lymphoma and then spread to the blood and bone marrow , or it may start in the blood and bone marrow without forming in the lymph nodes first    .
Both Burkitt leukemia and Burkitt lymphoma have been linked to infection with the Epstein - Barr virus ( EBV ) , although EBV infection is more likely to occur in patients in Africa than in the United States    .
Burkitt and Burkitt - like lymphoma / leukemia are diagnosed when a sample of tissue is checked and a certain change to the c-myc gene is found    .
- Diffuse large B - cell lymphoma : Diffuse large B - cell lymphoma is the most common type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma    .
It is a type of B - cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma that grows quickly in the lymph nodes    .
The spleen , liver , bone marrow , or other organs are also often affected    .
Diffuse large B - cell lymphoma occurs more often in adolescents than in children    .
- Primary mediastinal B - cell lymphoma :
A type of lymphoma that develops from B cells in the mediastinum ( the area behind the breastbone )    .
It may spread to nearby organs including the lungs and the sac around the heart    .
It may also spread to lymph nodes and distant organs including the kidneys    .
In children and adolescents , primary mediastinal B - cell lymphoma occurs more often in older adolescents    .
Lymphoblastic lymphoma Lymphoblastic lymphoma is a type of lymphoma that mainly affects T - cell lymphocytes    .
It usually forms in the mediastinum ( the area behind the breastbone )    .
This causes trouble breathing , wheezing , trouble swallowing , or swelling of the head and neck    .
It may spread to lymph nodes , bone , bone marrow , skin , the CNS , abdominal organs , and other areas    .
Lymphoblastic lymphoma is a lot like acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL )    .
Anaplastic large cell lymphoma
Anaplastic large cell lymphoma is a type of lymphoma that mainly affects T - cell lymphocytes    .
It usually forms in the lymph nodes , skin , or bone , and sometimes forms in the gastrointestinal tract , lung , tissue that covers the lungs , and muscle    .
Patients with anaplastic large cell lymphoma have a receptor , called CD30 , on the surface of their T cells    .
In many children , anaplastic large cell lymphoma is marked by changes in the ALK gene that makes a protein called anaplastic lymphoma kinase    .
A pathologist checks for these cell and gene changes to help diagnose anaplastic large cell lymphoma    .
Some types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma are rare in children    .
Some types of childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma are less common    .
These include : - Pediatric - type follicular lymphoma :
In children , follicular lymphoma occurs mainly in males    .
It is more likely to be found in one area and does not spread to other places in the body    .
It usually forms in the tonsils and lymph nodes in the neck , but may also form in the testicles , kidney , gastrointestinal tract , and salivary gland    .
- Marginal zone lymphoma : Marginal zone lymphoma is a type of lymphoma that tends to grow and spread slowly and is usually found at an early stage    .
It may be found in the lymph nodes or in areas outside the lymph nodes    .
Marginal zone lymphoma found outside the lymph nodes in children is called mucosa - associated lymphoid tissue ( MALT ) lymphoma and may be linked to Helicobacter pylori infection of the gastrointestinal tract and Chlamydophila psittaci infection of the conjunctival membrane which lines the eye    .
- Primary central nervous system ( CNS ) lymphoma : Primary CNS lymphoma is extremely rare in children    .
- Peripheral T - cell lymphoma : Peripheral T - cell lymphoma is an aggressive ( fast - growing ) non-Hodgkin lymphoma that begins in mature T lymphocytes    .
The T lymphocytes mature in the thymus gland and travel to other parts of the lymph system , such as the lymph nodes , bone marrow , and spleen    .
- Cutaneous T - cell lymphoma : Cutaneous T - cell lymphoma begins in the skin and can cause the skin to thicken or form a tumor    .
It is very rare in children , but is more common in adolescents and young adults    .
There are different types of cutaneous T - cell lymphoma , such as cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma , subcutaneous panniculitis - like T - cell lymphoma , gamma - delta T - cell lymphoma , and mycosis fungoides    .
Mycosis fungoides rarely occurs in children and adolescents    .
Past treatment for cancer and having a weakened immune system affect the risk of having childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma    .
Anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor    .
Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer ; not having risk factors doesnt mean that you will not get cancer    .
Talk with your child 's doctor if you think your child may be at risk    .
Possible risk factors for childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma include the following : - Past treatment for cancer    .
- Being infected with the Epstein - Barr virus or human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV )    .
- Having a weakened immune system after a transplant or from medicines given after a transplant    .
- Having certain inherited diseases of the immune system    .
If lymphoma or lymphoproliferative disease is linked to a weakened immune system from certain inherited diseases , HIV infection , a transplant or medicines given after a transplant , the condition is called lymphoproliferative disease associated with immunodeficiency    .
The different types of lymphoproliferative disease associated with immunodeficiency include : - Lymphoproliferative disease associated with primary immunodeficiency    .
- HIV - associated non-Hodgkin lymphoma    .    - Post - transplant lymphoproliferative disease    .
What are the symptoms of Childhood Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma ?

Signs of childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma include breathing problems and swollen lymph nodes    .
These and other signs may be caused by childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma or by other conditions    .
Check with a doctor if your child has any of the following : - Trouble breathing    .
- Wheezing    .    - Coughing    .    - High - pitched breathing sounds    .
- Swelling of the head , neck , upper body , or arms    .
- Trouble swallowing    .
- Painless swelling of the lymph nodes in the neck , underarm , stomach , or groin    .
- Painless lump or swelling in a testicle    .
- Fever for no known reason    .
- Weight loss for no known reason    .
- Night sweats    .
How to diagnose Childhood Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma ?

Tests that examine the body and lymph system are used to detect ( find ) and diagnose childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma    .
The following tests and procedures may be used : - Physical exam and history :
An exam of the body to check general signs of health , including checking for signs of disease , such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual    .
A history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken    .
- Blood chemistry studies :
A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body , including electrolytes , uric acid , blood urea nitrogen ( BUN ) , creatinine , and liver function values    .
An unusual ( higher or lower than normal ) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease    .
- Liver function tests :
A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by the liver    .
A higher than normal amount of a substance can be a sign of cancer    .
- CT scan ( CAT scan ) : A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body , taken from different angles    .
The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine    .
A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly    .
This procedure is also called computed tomography , computerized tomography , or computerized axial tomography    .
- PET scan ( positron emission tomography scan ) : A procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body    .
A small amount of radioactive glucose ( sugar ) is injected into a vein    .
The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body    .
Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do    .
Sometimes a PET scan and a CT scan are done at the same time    .
If there is any cancer , this increases the chance that it will be found    .
- MRI ( magnetic resonance imaging ) : A procedure that uses a magnet , radio waves , and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body    .
This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging ( NMRI )    .
- Lumbar puncture : A procedure used to collect cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) from the spinal column    .
This is done by placing a needle between two bones in the spine and into the CSF around the spinal cord and removing a sample of the fluid    .
The sample of CSF is checked under a microscope for signs that the cancer has spread to the brain and spinal cord    .
This procedure is also called an LP or spinal tap    .
- Chest x-ray :
An x-ray of the organs and bones inside the chest    .
An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film , making a picture of areas inside the body    .
- Ultrasound exam :
A procedure in which high - energy sound waves ( ultrasound ) are bounced off internal tissues or organs and make echoes    .
The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram    .
The picture can be printed to be looked at later    .
- A biopsy is done to diagnose childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma : Cells and tissues are removed during a biopsy so they can be viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer    .
Because treatment depends on the type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma , biopsy samples should be checked by a pathologist who has experience in diagnosing childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma    .
One of the following types of biopsies may be done : - Excisional biopsy :
The removal of an entire lymph node or lump of tissue    .
- Incisional biopsy :
The removal of part of a lump , lymph node , or sample of tissue    .
- Core biopsy :
The removal of tissue or part of a lymph node using a wide needle    .
- Fine - needle aspiration ( FNA ) biopsy :
The removal of tissue or part of a lymph node using a thin needle    .
The procedure used to remove the sample of tissue depends on where the tumor is in the body : - Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy :
The removal of bone marrow and a small piece of bone by inserting a hollow needle into the hipbone or breastbone    .
- Mediastinoscopy : A surgical procedure to look at the organs , tissues , and lymph nodes between the lungs for abnormal areas    .
An incision ( cut ) is made at the top of the breastbone and a mediastinoscope is inserted into the chest    .
A mediastinoscope is a thin , tube - like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing    .
It also has a tool to remove tissue or lymph node samples , which are checked under a microscope for signs of cancer    .
- Anterior mediastinotomy : A surgical procedure to look at the organs and tissues between the lungs and between the breastbone and heart for abnormal areas    .
An incision ( cut ) is made next to the breastbone and a mediastinoscope is inserted into the chest    .
A mediastinoscope is a thin , tube - like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing    .
It also has a tool to remove tissue or lymph node samples , which are checked under a microscope for signs of cancer    .
This is also called the Chamberlain procedure    .
- Thoracentesis :
The removal of fluid from the space between the lining of the chest and the lung , using a needle    .
A pathologist views the fluid under a microscope to look for cancer cells    .
If cancer is found , the following tests may be done to study the cancer cells : - Immunohistochemistry : A laboratory test that uses antibodies to check for certain antigens in a sample of tissue    .
The antibody is usually linked to a radioactive substance or a dye that causes the tissue to light up under a microscope    .
This type of test may be used to tell the difference between different types of cancer    .
- Flow cytometry :
A laboratory test that measures the number of cells in a sample , the percentage of live cells in a sample , and certain characteristics of cells , such as size , shape , and the presence of tumor markers on the cell surface    .
The cells are stained with a light - sensitive dye , placed in a fluid , and passed in a stream before a laser or other type of light    .
The measurements are based on how the light - sensitive dye reacts to the light    .
- Cytogenetic analysis :
A laboratory test in which cells in a sample of tissue are viewed under a microscope to look for certain changes in the chromosomes    .
- FISH ( fluorescence in situ hybridization ) : A laboratory test used to look at genes or chromosomes in cells and tissues    .
Pieces of DNA that contain a fluorescent dye are made in the laboratory and added to cells or tissues on a glass slide    .
When these pieces of DNA attach to certain genes or areas of chromosomes on the slide , they light up when viewed under a microscope with a special light    .
This type of test is used to find certain gene changes    .
- Immunophenotyping :
A laboratory test used to identify cells , based on the types of antigens or markers on the surface of the cell    .
This test is used to diagnose specific types of lymphoma by comparing the cancer cells to normal cells of the immune system    .
What is the outlook for Childhood Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma ?

Certain factors affect prognosis ( chance of recovery ) and treatment options    .
The prognosis ( chance of recovery ) and treatment options depend on : - The type of lymphoma    .    - Where the tumor is in the body when the tumor is diagnosed    .
- The stage of the cancer    .    - Whether there are certain changes in the chromosomes    .
- The type of initial treatment    .
- Whether the lymphoma responded to initial treatment    .
- The patients age and general health    .
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Childhood Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma ?

New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials    .
Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website    .
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
For some patients , taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice    .
Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process    .
Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment    .
Many of today 's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials    .
Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment    .

What are the stages of Childhood Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma ?

Key Points
- After childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma has been diagnosed , tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the lymph system or to other parts of the body    .
- There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body    .
- The following stages are used for childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma : - Stage I - Stage II - Stage III - Stage IV
After childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma has been diagnosed , tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the lymph system or to other parts of the body    .
The process used to find out if cancer has spread within the lymph system or to other parts of the body is called staging    .
The results of tests and procedures used to diagnose non-Hodgkin lymphoma may also be used for staging    .
See the General Information section for a description of these tests and procedures    .
The information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease    .
It is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment    .
The following procedure also may be used to determine the stage : - Bone scan :
A procedure to check if there are rapidly dividing cells , such as cancer cells , in the bone    .
A very small amount of radioactive material is injected into a vein and travels through the bloodstream    .
The radioactive material collects in the bones with cancer and is detected by a scanner    .
There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body    .
Cancer can spread through tissue , the lymph system , and the blood : - Tissue    .
The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas    .
- Lymph system    .
The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system    .
The cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body    .
- Blood    .
The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood    .
The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body    .
The following stages are used for childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma :
Stage I
In stage I childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma , cancer is found : - in one group of lymph nodes ; or - in one area outside the lymph nodes    .
No cancer is found in the abdomen or mediastinum ( area between the lungs )    .
Stage II
In stage II childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma , cancer is found : - in one area outside the lymph nodes and in nearby lymph nodes ; or - in two or more areas either above or below the diaphragm , and may have spread to nearby lymph nodes ; or - to have started in the stomach or intestines and can be completely removed by surgery    .
Cancer may have spread to certain nearby lymph nodes    .
Stage III
In stage III childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma , cancer is found : - in at least one area above the diaphragm and in at least one area below the diaphragm ; or - to have started in the chest ; or - to have started in the abdomen and spread throughout the abdomen ; or - in the area around the spine    .
Stage IV
In stage IV childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma , cancer is found in the bone marrow , brain , or cerebrospinal fluid    .
Cancer may also be found in other parts of the body    .
What are the treatments for Childhood Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma ?

- Children with non-Hodgkin lymphoma should have their treatment planned by a team of doctors who are experts in treating childhood cancer    .
- Some cancer treatments cause side effects months or years after treatment has ended    .
- Six types of standard treatment are used : - Chemotherapy - Radiation therapy - High - dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant - Targeted therapy - Other drug therapy - Phototherapy - New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials    .
- Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
- Patients can enter clinical trials before , during , or after starting their cancer treatment    .
- Follow - up tests may be needed    .
There are different types of treatment for children with non-Hodgkin lymphoma    .
Different types of treatment are available for children with non-Hodgkin lymphoma    .
Some treatments are standard ( the currently used treatment ) , and some are being tested in clinical trials    .
A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer    .
When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment , the new treatment may become the standard treatment    .
Taking part in a clinical trial should be considered for all children with non-Hodgkin lymphoma    .
Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment    .
Children with non-Hodgkin lymphoma should have their treatment planned by a team of doctors who are experts in treating childhood cancer    .
Treatment will be overseen by a pediatric oncologist , a doctor who specializes in treating children with cancer    .
The pediatric oncologist works with other health care providers who are experts in treating children with non-Hodgkin lymphoma and who specialize in certain areas of medicine    .
These may include the following specialists : - Pediatrician    .    - Radiation oncologist    .
- Pediatric hematologist    .
- Pediatric surgeon    .
- Pediatric nurse specialist    .

Some cancer treatments cause side effects months or years after treatment has ended    .
Side effects from cancer treatment that begin during or after treatment and continue for months or years are called late effects    .
Late effects of cancer treatment may include the following : - Physical problems    .
- Changes in mood , feelings , thinking , learning , or memory    .
- Second cancers ( new types of cancer )    .
Some late effects may be treated or controlled    .
It is important to talk with your child 's doctors about the effects cancer treatment can have on your child    .
( See the PDQ summary on Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer for more information    .    )
Six types of standard treatment are used :
Chemotherapy Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells , either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing    .
When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle , the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body ( systemic chemotherapy )    .
When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid ( intrathecal chemotherapy ) , an organ , or a body cavity such as the abdomen , the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas    .

Combination chemotherapy is treatment using two or more anticancer drugs    .
The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated    .
Intrathecal chemotherapy may be used to treat childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma that has spread , or may spread , to the brain    .
When used to lessen the chance cancer will spread to the brain , it is called CNS prophylaxis    .
Intrathecal chemotherapy is given in addition to chemotherapy by mouth or vein    .
Higher than usual doses of chemotherapy may also be used as CNS prophylaxis    .
See Drugs Approved for Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma for more information    .
Radiation therapy Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing    .
There are two types of radiation therapy : - External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer    .
- Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles , seeds , wires , or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer    .
The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma being treated    .
External radiation therapy may be used to treat childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma that has spread , or may spread , to the brain and spinal cord    .
Internal radiation therapy is not used to treat non-Hodgkin lymphoma    .
High - dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant
This treatment is a way of giving high doses of chemotherapy and then replacing blood - forming cells destroyed by the cancer treatment    .
Stem cells ( immature blood cells ) are removed from the bone marrow or blood of the patient or a donor and are frozen and stored    .
After the chemotherapy is completed , the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion    .
These reinfused stem cells grow into ( and restore ) the bodys blood cells    .
See Drugs Approved for Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma for more information    .
Targeted therapy Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells    .
Monoclonal antibodies , tyrosine kinase inhibitors , and immunotoxins are three types of targeted therapy being used or studied in the treatment of childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma    .
Monoclonal antibody therapy is a cancer treatment that uses antibodies made in the laboratory from a single type of immune system cell    .
These antibodies can identify substances on cancer cells or normal substances that may help cancer cells grow    .
The antibodies attach to the substances and kill the cancer cells , block their growth , or keep them from spreading    .
Monoclonal antibodies are given by infusion    .
They may be used alone or to carry drugs , toxins , or radioactive material directly to cancer cells    .
- Rituximab is used to treat several types of childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma    .
- Brentuximab vedotin is a monoclonal antibody combined with an anticancer drug that is used to treat anaplastic large cell lymphoma    .
A bispecific monoclonal antibody is made up of two different monoclonal antibodies that bind to two different substances and kills cancer cells    .
Bispecific monoclonal antibody therapy is used in the treatment of Burkitt and Burkitt - like lymphoma / leukemia and diffuse large B - cell lymphoma    .

Tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( TKIs ) block signals that tumors need to grow    .
Some TKIs also keep tumors from growing by preventing the growth of new blood vessels to the tumors    .
Other types of kinase inhibitors , such as crizotinib , are being studied for childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma    .
Immunotoxins can bind to cancer cells and kill them    .
Denileukin diftitox is an immunotoxin used to treat cutaneous T - cell lymphoma    .
See Drugs Approved for Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma for more information    .
Other drug therapy Retinoids are drugs related to vitamin A   .    Retinoid therapy with bexarotene is used to treat several types of cutaneous T - cell lymphoma    .
Steroids are hormones made naturally in the body    .
They can also be made in a laboratory and used as drugs    .
Steroid therapy is used to treat cutaneous T - cell lymphoma    .
Phototherapy Phototherapy is a cancer treatment that uses a drug and a certain type of laser light to kill cancer cells    .
A drug that is not active until it is exposed to light is injected into a vein    .
The drug collects more in cancer cells than in normal cells    .
For skin cancer in the skin , laser light is shined onto the skin and the drug becomes active and kills the cancer cells    .
Phototherapy is used in the treatment of cutaneous T - cell lymphoma    .
New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials    .
Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website    .
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
For some patients , taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice    .
Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process    .
Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment    .
Many of today 's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials    .
Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment    .
Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future    .
Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments , they often answer important questions and help move research forward    .
Patients can enter clinical trials before , during , or after starting their cancer treatment    .
Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment    .
Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better    .
There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring ( coming back ) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment    .
Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country    .
See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials    .
These have been retrieved from NCI 's listing of clinical trials    .
Follow - up tests may be needed    .
Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated    .
Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working    .
Decisions about whether to continue , change , or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests    .
Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended    .
The results of these tests can show if your child 's condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred ( come back )    .
These tests are sometimes called follow - up tests or check - ups    .

What is (are) Anal Cancer ?

Key Points
- Anal cancer is a disease in which malignant ( cancer ) cells form in the tissues of the anus    .
- Squamous cell carcinoma is the most common type of anal cancer    .
- In the United States , the number of new cases of anal cancer has increased in recent years    .
Anal cancer is a disease in which malignant ( cancer ) cells form in the tissues of the anus    .
The anus is the end of the large intestine , below the rectum , through which stool ( solid waste ) leaves the body    .
The anus is formed partly from the outer skin layers of the body and partly from the intestine    .
Two ring - like muscles , called sphincter muscles , open and close the anal opening and let stool pass out of the body    .
The anal canal , the part of the anus between the rectum and the anal opening , is about 1 - 1 inches long    .
The skin around the outside of the anus is called the perianal area    .
Tumors in this area are skin tumors , not anal cancer    .
See the following PDQ summary for more information about anal cancer : - Anal Cancer Treatment
Squamous cell carcinoma is the most common type of anal cancer    .
In the United States , the most common type of anal cancer is squamous cell carcinoma    .
Studies show that human papillomavirus ( HPV ) infection is the main cause of this type of anal cancer    .
Another type of anal cancer , called anal adenocarcinoma , is very rare and is not discussed in this summary    .
In the United States , the number of new cases of anal cancer has increased in recent years    .
From 2004 to 2013 , new cases of anal cancer and deaths from anal cancer increased each year    .
The increase in new cases was slightly higher in women and the increase in deaths from anal cancer was slightly higher in men    .
Who is at risk for Anal Cancer? ?

Being infected with the human papillomavirus ( HPV ) increases the risk of developing anal cancer    .
Risk factors include the following : - Being infected with human papillomavirus ( HPV )    .
- Having many sexual partners    .
- Having receptive anal intercourse ( anal sex )    .
- Being older than 50 years    .
- Frequent anal redness , swelling , and soreness    .
- Having anal fistulas ( abnormal openings )    .
- Smoking cigarettes    .
What are the symptoms of Anal Cancer ?

Signs of anal cancer include bleeding from the anus or rectum or a lump near the anus    .
These and other signs and symptoms may be caused by anal cancer or by other conditions    .
Check with your doctor if you have any of the following : - Bleeding from the anus or rectum    .
- Pain or pressure in the area around the anus    .
- Itching or discharge from the anus    .    - A lump near the anus    .    - A change in bowel habits    .
How to diagnose Anal Cancer ?

Tests that examine the rectum and anus are used to detect ( find ) and diagnose anal cancer    .
The following tests and procedures may be used : - Physical exam and history :
An exam of the body to check general signs of health , including checking for signs of disease , such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual    .
A history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken    .
- Digital rectal examination ( DRE ) : An exam of the anus and rectum    .
The doctor or nurse inserts a lubricated , gloved finger into the lower part of the rectum to feel for lumps or anything else that seems unusual    .
- Anoscopy :
An exam of the anus and lower rectum using a short , lighted tube called an anoscope    .
- Proctoscopy :
An exam of the rectum using a short , lighted tube called a proctoscope    .
- Endo-anal or endorectal ultrasound :
A procedure in which an ultrasound transducer ( probe ) is inserted into the anus or rectum and used to bounce high - energy sound waves ( ultrasound ) off internal tissues or organs and make echoes    .
The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram    .
- Biopsy :
The removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer    .
If an abnormal area is seen during the anoscopy , a biopsy may be done at that time    .
What is the outlook for Anal Cancer ?

Certain factors affect the prognosis ( chance of recovery ) and treatment options    .
The prognosis ( chance of recovery ) depends on the following : - The size of the tumor    .    - Where the tumor is in the anus    .
- Whether the cancer has spread to the lymph nodes    .
The treatment options depend on the following : - The stage of the cancer    .    - Where the tumor is in the anus    .
- Whether the patient has human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV )    .
- Whether cancer remains after initial treatment or has recurred    .
What are the stages of Anal Cancer ?

Key Points
- After anal cancer has been diagnosed , tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the anus or to other parts of the body    .
- There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body    .
- Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body    .
- The following stages are used for anal cancer : - Stage 0 ( Carcinoma in Situ ) - Stage I - Stage II - Stage IIIA - Stage IIIB - Stage IV
After anal cancer has been diagnosed , tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the anus or to other parts of the body    .
The process used to find out if cancer has spread within the anus or to other parts of the body is called staging    .
The information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease    .
It is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment    .
The following tests may be used in the staging process : - CT scan ( CAT scan ) :
A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body , such as the abdomen or chest , taken from different angles    .
The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine    .
A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly    .
This procedure is also called computed tomography , computerized tomography , or computerized axial tomography    .
For anal cancer , a CT scan of the pelvis and abdomen may be done    .
- Chest x-ray :
An x-ray of the organs and bones inside the chest    .
An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film , making a picture of areas inside the body    .
- MRI ( magnetic resonance imaging ) : A procedure that uses a magnet , radio waves , and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body    .
This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging ( NMRI )    .
- PET scan ( positron emission tomography scan ) : A procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body    .
A small amount of radioactive glucose ( sugar ) is injected into a vein    .
The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body    .
Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do    .
There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body    .
Cancer can spread through tissue , the lymph system , and the blood : - Tissue    .

The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas    .
- Lymph system    .
The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system    .
The cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body    .
- Blood    .
The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood    .
The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body    .
Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body    .
When cancer spreads to another part of the body , it is called metastasis    .
Cancer cells break away from where they began ( the primary tumor ) and travel through the lymph system or blood    .
- Lymph system    .
The cancer gets into the lymph system , travels through the lymph vessels , and forms a tumor ( metastatic tumor ) in another part of the body    .
- Blood    .
The cancer gets into the blood , travels through the blood vessels , and forms a tumor ( metastatic tumor ) in another part of the body    .
The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor    .
For example , if anal cancer spreads to the lung , the cancer cells in the lung are actually anal cancer cells    .
The disease is metastatic anal cancer , not lung cancer    .
The following stages are used for anal cancer :
Stage 0 ( Carcinoma in Situ )
In stage 0 , abnormal cells are found in the innermost lining of the anus    .
These abnormal cells may become cancer and spread into nearby normal tissue    .
Stage 0 is also called carcinoma in situ    .
Stage I
In stage I , cancer has formed and the tumor is 2 centimeters or smaller    .
Stage II
In stage II , the tumor is larger than 2 centimeters    .
Stage IIIA
In stage IIIA , the tumor may be any size and has spread to either : - lymph nodes near the rectum ; or - nearby organs , such as the vagina , urethra , and bladder    .
Stage IIIB
In stage IIIB , the tumor may be any size and has spread : - to nearby organs and to lymph nodes near the rectum ; or - to lymph nodes on one side of the pelvis and / or groin , and may have spread to nearby organs ; or - to lymph nodes near the rectum and in the groin , and / or to lymph nodes on both sides of the pelvis and / or groin , and may have spread to nearby organs    .
Stage IV
In stage IV , the tumor may be any size and cancer may have spread to lymph nodes or nearby organs and has spread to distant parts of the body    .
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Anal Cancer ?

New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials    .
This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials    .
It may not mention every new treatment being studied    .
Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website    .
Radiosensitizers Radiosensitizers are drugs that make tumor cells more sensitive to radiation therapy    .
Combining radiation therapy with radiosensitizers may kill more tumor cells    .
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
For some patients , taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice    .
Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process    .
Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment    .
Many of today 's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials    .
Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment    .
Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future    .
Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments , they often answer important questions and help move research forward    .
Patients can enter clinical trials before , during , or after starting their cancer treatment    .
Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment    .
Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better    .
There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring ( coming back ) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment    .
Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country    .

What are the treatments for Anal Cancer ?

Key Points
- There are different types of treatment for patients with anal cancer    .
- Three types of standard treatment are used : - Radiation therapy - Chemotherapy - Surgery - Having the human immunodeficiency virus can affect treatment of anal cancer    .
- New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials    .
- Radiosensitizers - Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
- Patients can enter clinical trials before , during , or after starting their cancer treatment    .
- Follow - up tests may be needed    .
There are different types of treatment for patients with anal cancer    .
Different types of treatments are available for patients with anal cancer    .
Some treatments are standard ( the currently used treatment ) , and some are being tested in clinical trials    .
A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer    .
When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment , the new treatment may become the standard treatment    .
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment    .
Three types of standard treatment are used :
Radiation therapy Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high - energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing    .
There are two types of radiation therapy : - External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer    .
- Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles , seeds , wires , or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer    .
The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated    .
External and internal radiation therapy are used to treat anal cancer    .
Chemotherapy Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells , either by killing the cells or by stopping the cells from dividing    .
When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle , the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body ( systemic chemotherapy )    .
When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid , an organ , or a body cavity such as the abdomen , the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas ( regional chemotherapy )    .
The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated    .
Surgery - Local resection : A surgical procedure in which the tumor is cut from the anus along with some of the healthy tissue around it    .
Local resection may be used if the cancer is small and has not spread    .
This procedure may save the sphincter muscles so the patient can still control bowel movements    .
Tumors that form in the lower part of the anus can often be removed with local resection    .
- Abdominoperineal resection : A surgical procedure in which the anus , the rectum , and part of the sigmoid colon are removed through an incision made in the abdomen    .
The doctor sews the end of the intestine to an opening , called a stoma , made in the surface of the abdomen so body waste can be collected in a disposable bag outside of the body    .
This is called a colostomy    .
Lymph nodes that contain cancer may also be removed during this operation    .
Having the human immunodeficiency virus can affect treatment of anal cancer    .
Cancer therapy can further damage the already weakened immune systems of patients who have the human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV )    .
For this reason , patients who have anal cancer and HIV are usually treated with lower doses of anticancer drugs and radiation than patients who do not have HIV    .
New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials    .

Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment    .
Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future    .
Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments , they often answer important questions and help move research forward    .
Patients can enter clinical trials before , during , or after starting their cancer treatment    .
Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment    .
Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better    .
There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring ( coming back ) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment    .
Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country    .
See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials    .
These have been retrieved from NCI 's listing of clinical trials    .
Follow - up tests may be needed    .
Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated    .
Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working    .
Decisions about whether to continue , change , or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests    .
Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended    .
The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred ( come back )    .
These tests are sometimes called follow - up tests or check - ups    .

How to prevent Anal Cancer ?

Key Points
- Avoiding risk factors and increasing protective factors may help prevent cancer    .    - The following are risk factors for anal cancer : - Anal HPV infection - Certain medical conditions - History of cervical , vaginal , or vulvar cancer - HIV infection / AIDS - Immunosuppression - Certain sexual practices - Cigarette smoking - The following protective factor decreases the risk of anal cancer : - HPV vaccine - It is not clear if the following protective factor decreases the risk of anal cancer : - Condom use - Cancer prevention clinical trials are used to study ways to prevent cancer    .
- New ways to prevent anal cancer are being studied in clinical trials    .
Avoiding risk factors and increasing protective factors may help prevent cancer    .
Avoiding cancer risk factors may help prevent certain cancers    .
Risk factors include smoking , being overweight , and not getting enough exercise    .
Increasing protective factors such as quitting smoking and exercising may also help prevent some cancers    .
Talk to your doctor or other health care professional about how you might lower your risk of cancer    .
The following are risk factors for anal cancer :
Anal HPV infection Being infected with human papillomavirus ( HPV ) is the main risk factor for anal cancer    .
Being infected with HPV can lead to squamous cell carcinoma of the anus , the most common type of anal cancer    .
About nine out of every ten cases of anal cancer are found in patients with anal HPV infection    .
Patients with healthy immune systems are usually able to fight HPV infections    .
Patients with weakened immune systems who are infected with HPV have a higher risk of anal cancer    .
Certain medical conditions
History of cervical , vaginal , or vulvar cancer Cervical cancer , vaginal cancer , and vulvar cancer are related to HPV infection    .
Women who have had cervical , vaginal , or vulvar cancer have a higher risk of anal cancer    .
HIV infection / AIDS Being infected with human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) is a strong risk factor for anal cancer    .
HIV is the cause of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS )    .
HIV weakens the body 's immune system and its ability to fight infection    .
HPV infection of the anus is common among patients who are HIV - positive    .
The risk of anal cancer is higher in men who are HIV - positive and have sex with men compared with men who are HIV - negative and have sex with men    .
Women who are HIV - positive also have an increased risk of anal cancer compared with women who are HIV - negative    .
Studies show that intravenous drug use or cigarette smoking may further increase the risk of anal cancer in patients who are HIV - positive    .
Immunosuppression Immunosuppression is a condition that weakens the body 's immune system and its ability to fight infections and other diseases    .
Chronic ( long - term ) immunosuppression may increase the risk of anal cancer because it lowers the body 's ability to fight HPV infection    .
Patients who have an organ transplant and receive immunosuppressive medicine to prevent organ rejection have an increased risk of anal cancer    .
Having an autoimmune disorder such as Crohn disease or psoriasis may increase the risk of anal cancer    .
It is not clear if the increased risk is due to the autoimmune condition , the treatment for the condition , or a combination of both    .
Certain sexual practices
The following sexual practices increase the risk of anal cancer because they increase the chance of being infected with HPV : - Having receptive anal intercourse ( anal sex )    .
- Having many sexual partners    .    - Sex between men    .
Men and women who have a history of anal warts or other sexually transmitted diseases also have an increased risk of anal cancer    .
Cigarette smoking Studies show that cigarette smoking increases the risk of anal cancer    .
Studies also show that current smokers have a higher risk of anal cancer than smokers who have quit or people who have never smoked    .
The following protective factor decreases the risk of anal cancer :
HPV vaccine
The human papillomavirus ( HPV ) vaccine is used to prevent anal cancer , cervical cancer , vulvar cancer , and vaginal cancer caused by HPV    .
It is also used to prevent lesions caused by HPV that may become cancer in the future    .
Studies show that being vaccinated against HPV lowers the risk of anal cancer    .
The vaccine may work best when it is given before a person is exposed to HPV    .
It is not clear if the following protective factor decreases the risk of anal cancer :
Condom use
It is not known if the use of condoms protects against anal HPV infection    .
This is because not enough studies have been done to prove this    .
Cancer prevention clinical trials are used to study ways to prevent cancer    .
Cancer prevention clinical trials are used to study ways to lower the risk of developing certain types of cancer    .
Some cancer prevention trials are conducted with healthy people who have not had cancer but who have an increased risk for cancer    .
Other prevention trials are conducted with people who have had cancer and are trying to prevent another cancer of the same type or to lower their chance of developing a new type of cancer    .
Other trials are done with healthy volunteers who are not known to have any risk factors for cancer    .
The purpose of some cancer prevention clinical trials is to find out whether actions people take can prevent cancer    .
These may include eating fruits and vegetables , exercising , quitting smoking , or taking certain medicines , vitamins , minerals , or food supplements    .
New ways to prevent anal cancer are being studied in clinical trials    .
Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country    .
Information about clinical trials for anal cancer prevention can be found in the Clinical Trials section of the NCI Web site    .
What is (are) Adult Central Nervous System Tumors ?

Key Points
- An adult central nervous system tumor is a disease in which abnormal cells form in the tissues of the brain and / or spinal cord    .    - A tumor that starts in another part of the body and spreads to the brain is called a metastatic brain tumor    .
- The brain controls many important body functions    .
- The spinal cord connects the brain to nerves in most parts of the body    .
- There are different types of brain and spinal cord tumors    .
- Astrocytic Tumors - Oligodendroglial Tumors - Mixed Gliomas - Ependymal Tumors - Medulloblastomas - Pineal Parenchymal Tumors - Meningeal Tumors - Germ Cell Tumors - Craniopharyngioma ( Grade I ) - Having certain genetic syndromes may increase the risk of a central nervous system tumor    .

- Tests that examine the brain and spinal cord are used to diagnose adult brain and spinal cord tumors    .    - A biopsy is also used to diagnose a brain tumor    .
- Sometimes a biopsy or surgery cannot be done    .
- Certain factors affect prognosis ( chance of recovery ) and treatment options    .
An adult central nervous system tumor is a disease in which abnormal cells form in the tissues of the brain and / or spinal cord    .
There are many types of brain and spinal cord tumors    .
The tumors are formed by the abnormal growth of cells and may begin in different parts of the brain or spinal cord    .
Together , the brain and spinal cord make up the central nervous system ( CNS )    .
The tumors may be either benign ( not cancer ) or malignant ( cancer ) : - Benign brain and spinal cord tumors grow and press on nearby areas of the brain    .
They rarely spread into other tissues and may recur ( come back )    .
- Malignant brain and spinal cord tumors are likely to grow quickly and spread into other brain tissue    .
When a tumor grows into or presses on an area of the brain , it may stop that part of the brain from working the way it should    .
Both benign and malignant brain tumors cause signs and symptoms and need treatment    .
Brain and spinal cord tumors can occur in both adults and children    .
However , treatment for children may be different than treatment for adults    .
( See the PDQ summary on Childhood Brain and Spinal Cord Tumors Treatment Overview for more information on the treatment of children    .    )
For information about lymphoma that begins in the brain , see the PDQ summary on Primary CNS Lymphoma Treatment    .
A tumor that starts in another part of the body and spreads to the brain is called a metastatic brain tumor    .
Tumors that start in the brain are called primary brain tumors    .
Primary brain tumors may spread to other parts of the brain or to the spine    .
They rarely spread to other parts of the body    .
Often , tumors found in the brain have started somewhere else in the body and spread to one or more parts of the brain    .
These are called metastatic brain tumors ( or brain metastases )    .
Metastatic brain tumors are more common than primary brain tumors    .
Up to half of metastatic brain tumors are from lung cancer    .
Other types of cancer that commonly spread to the brain include : - Melanoma    .    - Breast cancer    .    - Colon cancer    .    - Kidney cancer    .    - Nasopharyngeal cancer    .    - Cancer of unknown primary site    .
Cancer may spread to the leptomeninges ( the two innermost membranes covering the brain and spinal cord )    .
This is called leptomeningeal carcinomatosis    .
The most common cancers that spread to the leptomeninges include : - Breast cancer    .    - Lung cancer    .    - Leukemia    .    - Lymphoma    .
See the following for more information from PDQ about cancers that commonly spread to the brain or spinal cord : - Adult Hodgkin Lymphoma Treatment - Adult Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Treatment - Breast Cancer Treatment - Carcinoma of Unknown Primary Treatment - Colon Cancer Treatment - Leukemia Home Page - Melanoma Treatment - Nasopharyngeal Cancer Treatment - Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Treatment - Renal Cell Cancer Treatment - Small Cell Lung Cancer Treatment
The brain controls many important body functions    .
The brain has three major parts : - The cerebrum is the largest part of the brain    .
It is at the top of the head    .
The cerebrum controls thinking , learning , problem solving , emotions , speech , reading , writing , and voluntary movement    .
- The cerebellum is in the lower back of the brain ( near the middle of the back of the head )    .
It controls movement , balance , and posture    .    - The brain stem connects the brain to the spinal cord    .
It is in the lowest part of the brain ( just above the back of the neck )    .
The brain stem controls breathing , heart rate , and the nerves and muscles used to see , hear , walk , talk , and eat    .
The spinal cord connects the brain to nerves in most parts of the body    .
The spinal cord is a column of nerve tissue that runs from the brain stem down the center of the back    .
It is covered by three thin layers of tissue called membranes    .
These membranes are surrounded by the vertebrae ( back bones )    .
Spinal cord nerves carry messages between the brain and the rest of the body , such as a message from the brain to cause muscles to move or a message from the skin to the brain to feel touch    .
There are different types of brain and spinal cord tumors    .
Brain and spinal cord tumors are named based on the type of cell they formed in and where the tumor first formed in the CNS    .
The grade of a tumor may be used to tell the difference between slow - growing and fast - growing types of the tumor    .
The World Health Organization ( WHO ) tumor grades are based on how abnormal the cancer cells look under a microscope and how quickly the tumor is likely to grow and spread    .
WHO Tumor Grading System - Grade I ( low - grade )
The tumor cells look more like normal cells under a microscope and grow and spread more slowly than grade II , III , and IV tumor cells    .
They rarely spread into nearby tissues    .
Grade I brain tumors may be cured if they are completely removed by surgery    .
- Grade II
The tumor cells grow and spread more slowly than grade III and IV tumor cells    .
They may spread into nearby tissue and may recur ( come back )    .
Some tumors may become a higher - grade tumor    .
- Grade III
The tumor cells look very different from normal cells under a microscope and grow more quickly than grade I and II tumor cells    .
They are likely to spread into nearby tissue    .
- Grade IV ( high - grade )
The tumor cells do not look like normal cells under a microscope and grow and spread very quickly    .
There may be areas of dead cells in the tumor    .
Grade IV tumors usually cannot be cured    .
The following types of primary tumors can form in the brain or spinal cord : Astrocytic Tumors
An astrocytic tumor begins in star - shaped brain cells called astrocytes , which help keep nerve cells healthy    .
An astrocyte is a type of glial cell    .
Glial cells sometimes form tumors called gliomas    .
Astrocytic tumors include the following : - Brain stem glioma ( usually high grade ) : A brain stem glioma forms in the brain stem , which is the part of the brain connected to the spinal cord    .
It is often a high - grade tumor , which spreads widely through the brain stem and is hard to cure    .
Brain stem gliomas are rare in adults    .
( See the PDQ summary on Childhood Brain Stem Glioma Treatment for more information    .    )
- Pineal astrocytic tumor ( any grade ) : A pineal astrocytic tumor forms in tissue around the pineal gland and may be any grade    .
The pineal gland is a tiny organ in the brain that makes melatonin , a hormone that helps control the sleeping and waking cycle    .
- Pilocytic astrocytoma ( grade I ) : A pilocytic astrocytoma grows slowly in the brain or spinal cord    .
It may be in the form of a cyst and rarely spreads into nearby tissues    .
Pilocytic astrocytomas can often be cured    .
- Diffuse astrocytoma ( grade II ) : A diffuse astrocytoma grows slowly , but often spreads into nearby tissues    .
The tumor cells look something like normal cells    .
In some cases , a diffuse astrocytoma can be cured    .
It is also called a low - grade diffuse astrocytoma    .
- Anaplastic astrocytoma ( grade III ) :
An anaplastic astrocytoma grows quickly and spreads into nearby tissues    .
The tumor cells look different from normal cells    .
This type of tumor usually cannot be cured    .
An anaplastic astrocytoma is also called a malignant astrocytoma or high - grade astrocytoma    .
- Glioblastoma ( grade IV ) : A glioblastoma grows and spreads very quickly    .
The tumor cells look very different from normal cells    .
This type of tumor usually cannot be cured    .
It is also called glioblastoma multiforme    .
See the PDQ summary on Childhood Astrocytomas Treatment for more information about astrocytomas in children    .
Oligodendroglial Tumors
An oligodendroglial tumor begins in brain cells called oligodendrocytes , which help keep nerve cells healthy    .
An oligodendrocyte is a type of glial cell    .
Oligodendrocytes sometimes form tumors called oligodendrogliomas    .
Grades of oligodendroglial tumors include the following : - Oligodendroglioma ( grade II ) :
An oligodendroglioma grows slowly , but often spreads into nearby tissues    .
The tumor cells look something like normal cells    .
In some cases , an oligodendroglioma can be cured    .
- Anaplastic oligodendroglioma ( grade III ) :
An anaplastic oligodendroglioma grows quickly and spreads into nearby tissues    .
The tumor cells look different from normal cells    .
This type of tumor usually cannot be cured    .
See the PDQ summary on Childhood Astrocytomas Treatment for more information about oligodendroglial tumors in children    .
Mixed Gliomas
A mixed glioma is a brain tumor that has two types of tumor cells in it oligodendrocytes and astrocytes    .
This type of mixed tumor is called an oligoastrocytoma    .
- Oligoastrocytoma ( grade II ) :
An oligoastrocytoma is a slow - growing tumor    .
The tumor cells look something like normal cells    .
In some cases , an oligoastrocytoma can be cured    .
- Anaplastic oligoastrocytoma ( grade III ) :
An anaplastic oligoastrocytoma grows quickly and spreads into nearby tissues    .
The tumor cells look different from normal cells    .
This type of tumor has a worse prognosis than oligoastrocytoma ( grade II )    .
See the PDQ summary on Childhood Astrocytomas Treatment for more information about mixed gliomas in children    .
Ependymal Tumors
An ependymal tumor usually begins in cells that line the fluid - filled spaces in the brain and around the spinal cord    .
An ependymal tumor may also be called an ependymoma    .
Grades of ependymomas include the following : - Ependymoma ( grade I or II ) : A grade I or II ependymoma grows slowly and has cells that look something like normal cells    .
There are two types of grade I ependymoma myxopapillary ependymoma and subependymoma    .
A grade II ependymoma grows in a ventricle ( fluid - filled space in the brain ) and its connecting paths or in the spinal cord    .
In some cases , a grade I or II ependymoma can be cured    .
- Anaplastic ependymoma ( grade III ) :
An anaplastic ependymoma grows quickly and spreads into nearby tissues    .
The tumor cells look different from normal cells    .
This type of tumor usually has a worse prognosis than a grade I or II ependymoma    .
See the PDQ summary on Childhood Ependymoma Treatment for more information about ependymoma in children    .
Medulloblastomas
A medulloblastoma is a type of embryonal tumor    .
Medulloblastomas are most common in children or young adults    .
See the PDQ summary on Childhood Central Nervous System Embryonal Tumors Treatment for more information about medulloblastomas in children    .
Pineal Parenchymal Tumors
A pineal parenchymal tumor forms in parenchymal cells or pineocytes , which are the cells that make up most of the pineal gland    .

These tumors are different from pineal astrocytic tumors    .
Grades of pineal parenchymal tumors include the following : - Pineocytoma ( grade II ) : A pineocytoma is a slow - growing pineal tumor    .
- Pineoblastoma ( grade IV ) : A pineoblastoma is a rare tumor that is very likely to spread    .
See the PDQ summary on Childhood Central Nervous System Embryonal Tumors Treatment for more information about pineal parenchymal tumors in children    .
Meningeal Tumors
A meningeal tumor , also called a meningioma , forms in the meninges ( thin layers of tissue that cover the brain and spinal cord )    .
It can form from different types of brain or spinal cord cells    .
Meningiomas are most common in adults    .
Types of meningeal tumors include the following : - Meningioma ( grade I ) : A grade I meningioma is the most common type of meningeal tumor    .
A grade I meningioma is a slow - growing tumor    .
It forms most often in the dura mater    .
A grade I meningioma can be cured if it is completely removed by surgery    .
- Meningioma ( grade II and III ) :
This is a rare meningeal tumor    .
It grows quickly and is likely to spread within the brain and spinal cord    .
The prognosis is worse than a grade I meningioma because the tumor usually cannot be completely removed by surgery    .
A hemangiopericytoma is not a meningeal tumor but is treated like a grade II or III meningioma    .
A hemangiopericytoma usually forms in the dura mater    .
The prognosis is worse than a grade I meningioma because the tumor usually cannot be completely removed by surgery    .
Germ Cell Tumors
A germ cell tumor forms in germ cells , which are the cells that develop into sperm in men or ova ( eggs ) in women    .
There are different types of germ cell tumors    .
These include germinomas , teratomas , embryonal yolk sac carcinomas , and choriocarcinomas    .
Germ cell tumors can be either benign or malignant    .
See the PDQ summary on Childhood Central Nervous System Germ Cell Tumors Treatment for more information about childhood germ cell tumors in the brain    .
Craniopharyngioma ( Grade I ) A craniopharyngioma is a rare tumor that usually forms in the center of the brain just above the pituitary gland ( a pea-sized organ at the bottom of the brain that controls other glands )    .
Craniopharyngiomas can form from different types of brain or spinal cord cells    .
See the PDQ summary on Childhood Craniopharyngioma Treatment for more information about craniopharyngioma in children    .
Who is at risk for Adult Central Nervous System Tumors? ?

Having certain genetic syndromes may increase the risk of a central nervous system tumor    .
Anything that increases your chance of getting a disease is called a risk factor    .
Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer ; not having risk factors doesnt mean that you will not get cancer    .
Talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk    .
There are few known risk factors for brain tumors    .
The following conditions may increase the risk of certain types of brain tumors : - Being exposed to vinyl chloride may increase the risk of glioma    .
- Infection with the Epstein - Barr virus , having AIDS ( acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ) , or receiving an organ transplant may increase the risk of primary CNS lymphoma    .
( See the PDQ summary on Primary CNS Lymphoma for more information    .    ) - Having certain genetic syndromes may increase the risk brain tumors : - Neurofibromatosis type 1 ( NF1 ) or 2 ( NF2 )    .    - von Hippel - Lindau disease    .
- Tuberous sclerosis    .
- Li-Fraumeni syndrome    .    - Turcot syndrome type 1 or 2    .    - Nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome    .
What causes Adult Central Nervous System Tumors ?

The cause of most adult brain and spinal cord tumors is not known    .
What are the symptoms of Adult Central Nervous System Tumors ?

The signs and symptoms of adult brain and spinal cord tumors are not the same in every person    .
Signs and symptoms depend on the following : - Where the tumor forms in the brain or spinal cord    .
- मस्तिष्क या रीढ़ की हड्डी में ट्यूमर कहां है।
- What the affected part of the brain controls    .
- The size of the tumor    .
Signs and symptoms may be caused by CNS tumors or by other conditions , including cancer that has spread to the brain    .
Check with your doctor if you have any of the following : Brain Tumor Symptoms - Morning headache or headache that goes away after vomiting    .
- सुबह सिरदर्द या ऐसा सिरदर्द जो उल्टी के बाद दूर हो जाता ।
- Seizures    .    - Vision , hearing , and speech problems    .
-  देखने, सुनने और बोलने में समस्याएं।
- Loss of appetite    .
- Frequent nausea and vomiting    .
- Changes in personality , mood , ability to focus , or behavior    .
- Loss of balance and trouble walking    .
- Weakness    .    - Unusual sleepiness or change in activity level    .
Spinal Cord Tumor Symptoms - Back pain or pain that spreads from the back towards the arms or legs    .
- A change in bowel habits or trouble urinating    .
- Weakness or numbness in the arms or legs    .
- Trouble walking    .
How to diagnose Adult Central Nervous System Tumors ?

Tests that examine the brain and spinal cord are used to diagnose adult brain and spinal cord tumors    .
The following tests and procedures may be used : - Physical exam and history :
An exam of the body to check general signs of health , including checking for signs of disease , such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual    .
A history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken    .
- Neurological exam :
A series of questions and tests to check the brain , spinal cord , and nerve function    .
The exam checks a persons mental status , coordination , and ability to walk normally , and how well the muscles , senses , and reflexes work    .
This may also be called a neuro exam or a neurologic exam    .
- Visual field exam :
An exam to check a persons field of vision ( the total area in which objects can be seen )    .
This test measures both central vision ( how much a person can see when looking straight ahead ) and peripheral vision ( how much a person can see in all other directions while staring straight ahead )    .
Any loss of vision may be a sign of a tumor that has damaged or pressed on the parts of the brain that affect eyesight    .
- Tumor marker test :
A procedure in which a sample of blood , urine , or tissue is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances made by organs , tissues , or tumor cells in the body    .
Certain substances are linked to specific types of cancer when found in increased levels in the body    .
These are called tumor markers    .
This test may be done to diagnose a germ cell tumor    .
- Gene testing :
A laboratory test in which a sample of blood or tissue is tested for changes in a chromosome that has been linked with a certain type of brain tumor    .
This test may be done to diagnose an inherited syndrome    .
- CT scan ( CAT scan ) : A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body , taken from different angles    .
The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine    .
A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly    .
This procedure is also called computed tomography , computerized tomography , or computerized axial tomography    .
- MRI ( magnetic resonance imaging ) with gadolinium :
A procedure that uses a magnet , radio waves , and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of the brain and spinal cord    .
A substance called gadolinium is injected into a vein    .
The gadolinium collects around the cancer cells so they show up brighter in the picture    .
This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging ( NMRI )    .
MRI is often used to diagnose tumors in the spinal cord    .
Sometimes a procedure called magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( MRS ) is done during the MRI scan    .
An MRS is used to diagnose tumors , based on their chemical make - up    .
- SPECT scan ( single photon emission computed tomography scan ) :
A procedure that uses a special camera linked to a computer to make a 3 - dimensional ( 3 - D ) picture of the brain    .
A very small amount of a radioactive substance is injected into a vein or inhaled through the nose    .
As the substance travels through the blood , the camera rotates around the head and takes pictures of the brain    .
Blood flow and metabolism are higher than normal in areas where cancer cells are growing    .
These areas will show up brighter in the picture    .
This procedure may be done just before or after a CT scan    .
SPECT is used to tell the difference between a primary tumor and a tumor that has spread to the brain from somewhere else in the body    .
- PET scan ( positron emission tomography scan ) : A procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body    .
A small amount of radioactive glucose ( sugar ) is injected into a vein    .
The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the brain    .
Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do    .
PET is used to tell the difference between a primary tumor and a tumor that has spread to the brain from somewhere else in the body    .
A biopsy is also used to diagnose a brain tumor    .
If imaging tests show there may be a brain tumor , a biopsy is usually done    .
One of the following types of biopsies may be used : - Stereotactic biopsy :
When imaging tests show there may be a tumor deep in the brain in a hard to reach place , a stereotactic brain biopsy may be done    .
This kind of biopsy uses a computer and a 3 - dimensional ( 3 - D ) scanning device to find the tumor and guide the needle used to remove the tissue    .
A small incision is made in the scalp and a small hole is drilled through the skull    .
A biopsy needle is inserted through the hole to remove cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer    .
- Open biopsy :
When imaging tests show that there may be a tumor that can be removed by surgery , an open biopsy may be done    .
A part of the skull is removed in an operation called a craniotomy    .
A sample of brain tissue is removed and viewed under a microscope by a pathologist    .
If cancer cells are found , some or all of the tumor may be removed during the same surgery    .
Tests are done before surgery to find the areas around the tumor that are important for normal brain function    .
There are also ways to test brain function during surgery    .
The doctor will use the results of these tests to remove as much of the tumor as possible with the least damage to normal tissue in the brain    .
The pathologist checks the biopsy sample to find out the type and grade of brain tumor    .
The grade of the tumor is based on how the tumor cells look under a microscope and how quickly the tumor is likely to grow and spread    .
The following tests may be done on the tumor tissue that is removed : - Immunohistochemistry :
A test that uses antibodies to check for certain antigens in a sample of tissue    .
The antibody is usually linked to a radioactive substance or a dye that causes the tissue to light up under a microscope    .
This type of test may be used to tell the difference between different types of cancer    .
- Light and electron microscopy :
A laboratory test in which cells in a sample of tissue are viewed under regular and high - powered microscopes to look for certain changes in the cells    .
- Cytogenetic analysis :
A laboratory test in which cells in a sample of tissue are viewed under a microscope to look for certain changes in the chromosomes    .
Sometimes a biopsy or surgery cannot be done    .
For some tumors , a biopsy or surgery cannot be done safely because of where the tumor formed in the brain or spinal cord    .
These tumors are diagnosed and treated based on the results of imaging tests and other procedures    .
Sometimes the results of imaging tests and other procedures show that the tumor is very likely to be benign and a biopsy is not done    .
What is the outlook for Adult Central Nervous System Tumors ?

Certain factors affect prognosis ( chance of recovery ) and treatment options    .
The prognosis ( chance of recovery ) and treatment options for primary brain and spinal cord tumors depend on the following : - The type and grade of the tumor    .
- Where the tumor is in the brain or spinal cord    .
- Whether the tumor can be removed by surgery    .
- Whether cancer cells remain after surgery    .
- Whether there are certain changes in the chromosomes    .
- Whether the cancer has just been diagnosed or has recurred ( come back )    .
- The patient 's general health    .
The prognosis and treatment options for metastatic brain and spinal cord tumors depend on the following : - Whether there are more than two tumors in the brain or spinal cord    .
- Where the tumor is in the brain or spinal cord    .
- How well the tumor responds to treatment    .
- Whether the primary tumor continues to grow or spread    .
What are the stages of Adult Central Nervous System Tumors ?

Key Points
- There is no standard staging system for adult brain and spinal cord tumors    .
- Imaging tests may be repeated after surgery to help plan more treatment    .
There is no standard staging system for adult brain and spinal cord tumors    .
The extent or spread of cancer is usually described as stages    .
There is no standard staging system for brain and spinal cord tumors    .
Brain tumors that begin in the brain may spread to other parts of the brain and spinal cord , but they rarely spread to other parts of the body    .
Treatment of primary brain and spinal cord tumors is based on the following : - The type of cell in which the tumor began    .
- Where the tumor formed in the brain or spinal cord    .
- The amount of cancer left after surgery    .
- The grade of the tumor    .
Treatment of tumors that have spread to the brain from other parts of the body is based on the number of tumors in the brain    .
Imaging tests may be repeated after surgery to help plan more treatment    .
Some of the tests and procedures used to diagnose a brain or spinal cord tumor may be repeated after treatment to find out how much tumor is left    .
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Adult Central Nervous System Tumors ?

New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials    .
This summary section refers to new treatments being studied in clinical trials , but it may not mention every new treatment being studied    .
Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website    .
Proton beam radiation therapy Proton beam radiation therapy is a type of high - energy , external radiation therapy that uses streams of protons ( small , positively - charged pieces of matter ) to make radiation    .
This type of radiation kills tumor cells with little damage to nearby tissues    .
It is used to treat cancers of the head , neck , and spine and organs such as the brain , eye , lung , and prostate    .
Proton beam radiation is different from x-ray radiation    .
Biologic therapy Biologic therapy is a treatment that uses the patients immune system to fight cancer    .
Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost , direct , or restore the bodys natural defenses against cancer    .
This type of cancer treatment is also called biotherapy or immunotherapy    .
Biologic therapy is being studied for the treatment of some types of brain tumors    .
Treatments may include the following : - Dendritic cell vaccine therapy    .    - Gene therapy    .
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
For some patients , taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice    .
Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process    .
Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment    .
Many of today 's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials    .
Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment    .
Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future    .
Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments , they often answer important questions and help move research forward    .
Patients can enter clinical trials before , during , or after starting their cancer treatment    .
Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment    .
Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better    .
There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring ( coming back ) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment    .
Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country    .
See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials    .

What are the treatments for Adult Central Nervous System Tumors ?

Key Points
- There are different types of treatment for patients with adult brain and spinal cord tumors    .
- Five types of standard treatment are used : - Active surveillance - Surgery - Radiation therapy - Chemotherapy - Targeted therapy - Supportive care is given to lessen the problems caused by the disease or its treatment    .
- New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials    .
- Proton beam radiation therapy - Biologic therapy - Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
- Patients can enter clinical trials before , during , or after starting their cancer treatment    .
- Follow - up tests may be needed    .
There are different types of treatment for patients with adult brain and spinal cord tumors    .
Different types of treatment are available for patients with adult brain and spinal cord tumors    .
Some treatments are standard ( the currently used treatment ) , and some are being tested in clinical trials    .
A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer    .
When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment , the new treatment may become the standard treatment    .
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment    .
Five types of standard treatment are used :
Active surveillance Active surveillance is closely watching a patients condition but not giving any treatment unless there are changes in test results that show the condition is getting worse    .
Active surveillance may be used to avoid or delay the need for treatments such as radiation therapy or surgery , which can cause side effects or other problems    .
During active surveillance , certain exams and tests are done on a regular schedule    .
Active surveillance may be used for very slow - growing tumors that do not cause symptoms    .
Surgery Surgery may be used to diagnose and treat adult brain and spinal cord tumors    .
Removing tumor tissue helps decrease pressure of the tumor on nearby parts of the brain    .
See the General Information section of this summary    .
Even if the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery , some patients may be given chemotherapy or radiation therapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left    .
Treatment given after the surgery , to lower the risk that the cancer will come back , is called adjuvant therapy    .
Radiation therapy Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high - energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing    .
There are two types of radiation therapy : - External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer    .
- एक्सटरनल रेडिएशन थेरेपी में कैंसर की ओर विकिरण भेजने के लिए शरीर के बाहर एक मशीन का उपयोग किया जाता है।
Certain ways of giving radiation therapy can help keep radiation from damaging nearby healthy tissue    .
These types of radiation therapy include the following : - Conformal radiation therapy : Conformal radiation therapy is a type of external radiation therapy that uses a computer to make a 3 - dimensional ( 3 - D ) picture of the tumor and shapes the radiation beams to fit the tumor    .
-कॉनफॉर्मल रेडिएशन थेरेपी : कॉनफॉर्मल रेडिएशन थेरेपी एक प्रकार की एक्सटरनल रेडिएशन थेरेपी है, जो ट्यूमर के 3-आयामी (3-डी) चित्र बनाने के लिए कंप्यूटर का उपयोग करती है और ट्यूमर के अनुसार रेडिएशन बीम को आकार देती है ।
- Intensity - modulated radiation therapy ( IMRT ) : IMRT is a type of 3 - dimensional ( 3 - D ) external radiation therapy that uses a computer to make pictures of the size and shape of the tumor    .
Thin beams of radiation of different intensities ( strengths ) are aimed at the tumor from many angles    .
- Stereotactic radiosurgery : Stereotactic radiosurgery is a type of external radiation therapy    .
A rigid head frame is attached to the skull to keep the head still during the radiation treatment    .
A machine aims a single large dose of radiation directly at the tumor    .
This procedure does not involve surgery    .
It is also called stereotaxic radiosurgery , radiosurgery , and radiation surgery    .
- Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles , seeds , wires , or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer    .
The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and grade of tumor and where it is in the brain or spinal cord    .
External radiation therapy is used to treat adult central nervous system tumors    .
Chemotherapy Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells , either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing    .
When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle , the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body ( systemic chemotherapy )    .
When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid , an organ , or a body cavity such as the abdomen , the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas ( regional chemotherapy )    .
Combination chemotherapy is treatment using more than one anticancer drug    .
To treat brain tumors , a wafer that dissolves may be used to deliver an anticancer drug directly to the brain tumor site after the tumor has been removed by surgery    .
The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and grade of tumor and where it is in the brain    .
Anticancer drugs given by mouth or vein to treat brain and spinal cord tumors cannot cross the blood - brain barrier and enter the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord    .
Instead , an anticancer drug is injected into the fluid - filled space to kill cancer cells there    .
This is called intrathecal chemotherapy    .
See Drugs Approved for Brain Tumors for more information    .
Targeted therapy Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells    .
Monoclonal antibody therapy is a type of targeted therapy that uses antibodies made in the laboratory from a single type of immune system cell    .
These antibodies can identify substances on cancer cells or normal substances that may help cancer cells grow    .
The antibodies attach to the substances and kill the cancer cells , block their growth , or keep them from spreading    .
Monoclonal antibodies are given by infusion    .
They may be used alone or to carry drugs , toxins , or radioactive material directly to cancer cells    .
Bevacizumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to a protein called vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) and may prevent the growth of new blood vessels that tumors need to grow    .
Bevacizumab is used in the treatment of recurrent glioblastoma    .
Other types of targeted therapies are being studied for adult brain tumors , including tyrosine kinase inhibitors and new VEGF inhibitors    .
See Drugs Approved for Brain Tumors for more information    .
Supportive care is given to lessen the problems caused by the disease or its treatment    .
This therapy controls problems or side effects caused by the disease or its treatment and improves quality of life    .
For brain tumors , supportive care includes drugs to control seizures and fluid buildup or swelling in the brain    .
New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials    .
This summary section refers to new treatments being studied in clinical trials , but it may not mention every new treatment being studied    .
Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website    .

These have been retrieved from NCI 's listing of clinical trials    .
Follow - up tests may be needed    .
Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated    .
Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working    .
Decisions about whether to continue , change , or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests    .
Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended    .
The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred ( come back )    .
These tests are sometimes called follow - up tests or check - ups    .
The following tests and procedures may be used to check whether a brain tumor has come back after treatment : - SPECT scan ( single photon emission computed tomography scan ) :
A procedure that uses a special camera linked to a computer to make a 3 - dimensional ( 3 - D ) picture of the brain    .
A very small amount of a radioactive substance is injected into a vein or inhaled through the nose    .
As the substance travels through the blood , the camera rotates around the head and takes pictures of the brain    .
Blood flow and metabolism are higher than normal in areas where cancer cells are growing    .
These areas will show up brighter in the picture    .
This procedure may be done just before or after a CT scan    .
- PET scan ( positron emission tomography scan ) : A procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body    .
A small amount of radioactive glucose ( sugar ) is injected into a vein    .
The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the brain    .
Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do    .

What is (are) Childhood Brain and Spinal Cord Tumors ?

Key Points
- A childhood brain or spinal cord tumor is a disease in which abnormal cells form in the tissues of the brain or spinal cord    .
- The brain controls many important body functions    .
- The spinal cord connects the brain with nerves in most parts of the body    .
- Brain and spinal cord tumors are a common type of childhood cancer    .
- The cause of most childhood brain and spinal cord tumors is unknown    .
- The signs and symptoms of childhood brain and spinal cord tumors are not the same in every child    .
- Tests that examine the brain and spinal cord are used to detect ( find ) childhood brain and spinal cord tumors    .
- Most childhood brain tumors are diagnosed and removed in surgery    .
- Some childhood brain and spinal cord tumors are diagnosed by imaging tests    .
- Certain factors affect prognosis ( chance of recovery )    .
A childhood brain or spinal cord tumor is a disease in which abnormal cells form in the tissues of the brain or spinal cord    .
There are many types of childhood brain and spinal cord tumors    .
The tumors are formed by the abnormal growth of cells and may begin in different areas of the brain or spinal cord    .
The tumors may be benign ( not cancer ) or malignant ( cancer )    .
Benign brain tumors grow and press on nearby areas of the brain    .
They rarely spread into other tissues    .
Malignant brain tumors are likely to grow quickly and spread into other brain tissue    .
When a tumor grows into or presses on an area of the brain , it may stop that part of the brain from working the way it should    .
Both benign and malignant brain tumors can cause signs or symptoms and need treatment    .
Together , the brain and spinal cord make up the central nervous system ( CNS )    .
The brain controls many important body functions    .
The brain has three major parts : - The cerebrum is the largest part of the brain    .
It is at the top of the head    .
The cerebrum controls thinking , learning , problem solving , emotions , speech , reading , writing , and voluntary movement    .
- The cerebellum is in the lower back of the brain ( near the middle of the back of the head )    .
It controls movement , balance , and posture    .    - The brain stem connects the brain to the spinal cord    .
It is in the lowest part of the brain ( just above the back of the neck )    .
The brain stem controls breathing , heart rate , and the nerves and muscles used in seeing , hearing , walking , talking , and eating    .
The spinal cord connects the brain with nerves in most parts of the body    .
The spinal cord is a column of nerve tissue that runs from the brain stem down the center of the back    .
It is covered by three thin layers of tissue called membranes    .
These membranes are surrounded by the vertebrae ( back bones )    .
Spinal cord nerves carry messages between the brain and the rest of the body , such as a message from the brain to cause muscles to move or a message from the skin to the brain to feel touch    .
Brain and spinal cord tumors are a common type of childhood cancer    .
Although cancer is rare in children , brain and spinal cord tumors are the third most common type of childhood cancer , after leukemia and lymphoma    .
Brain tumors can occur in both children and adults    .
Treatment for children is usually different than treatment for adults    .
( See the PDQ summary on Adult Central Nervous System Tumors Treatment for more information about the treatment of adults    .    )
This summary describes the treatment of primary brain and spinal cord tumors ( tumors that begin in the brain and spinal cord )    .
Treatment of metastatic brain and spinal cord tumors is not covered in this summary    .
Metastatic tumors are formed by cancer cells that begin in other parts of the body and spread to the brain or spinal cord    .
What causes Childhood Brain and Spinal Cord Tumors ?

The cause of most childhood brain and spinal cord tumors is unknown    .
What are the symptoms of Childhood Brain and Spinal Cord Tumors ?

The signs and symptoms of childhood brain and spinal cord tumors are not the same in every child    .
Signs and symptoms depend on the following : - Where the tumor forms in the brain or spinal cord    .
- The size of the tumor    .
- How fast the tumor grows    .
- The child 's age and development    .
Signs and symptoms may be caused by childhood brain and spinal cord tumors or by other conditions , including cancer that has spread to the brain    .
Check with your child 's doctor if your child has any of the following : Brain Tumor Signs and Symptoms - Morning headache or headache that goes away after vomiting    .
- Frequent nausea and vomiting    .
- Vision , hearing , and speech problems    .
- Loss of balance and trouble walking    .
- Unusual sleepiness or change in activity level    .
- Unusual changes in personality or behavior    .
- Seizures    .    - Increase in the head size ( in infants )    .
Spinal Cord Tumor Signs and Symptoms - Back pain or pain that spreads from the back towards the arms or legs    .
- A change in bowel habits or trouble urinating    .
- Weakness in the legs    .
- Trouble walking    .
In addition to these signs and symptoms of brain and spinal cord tumors , some children are unable to reach certain growth and development milestones such as sitting up , walking , and talking in sentences    .
How to diagnose Childhood Brain and Spinal Cord Tumors ?

Tests that examine the brain and spinal cord are used to detect ( find ) childhood brain and spinal cord tumors    .
The following tests and procedures may be used : - Physical exam and history :
An exam of the body to check general signs of health , including checking for signs of disease , such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual    .
A history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken    .
- Neurological exam :
A series of questions and tests to check the brain , spinal cord , and nerve function    .
The exam checks a persons mental status , coordination , and ability to walk normally , and how well the muscles , senses , and reflexes work    .
This may also be called a neuro exam or a neurologic exam    .
- MRI ( magnetic resonance imaging ) with gadolinium :
A procedure that uses a magnet , radio waves , and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of the brain and spinal cord    .
A substance called gadolinium is injected into a vein    .
The gadolinium collects around the cancer cells so they show up brighter in the picture    .

This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging ( NMRI )    .
- Serum tumor marker test :
A procedure in which a sample of blood is examined to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs , tissues , or tumor cells in the body    .
Certain substances are linked to specific types of cancer when found in increased levels in the blood    .
These are called tumor markers    .
Most childhood brain tumors are diagnosed and removed in surgery    .
If doctors think there might be a brain tumor , a biopsy may be done to remove a sample of tissue    .
For tumors in the brain , the biopsy is done by removing part of the skull and using a needle to remove a sample of tissue    .
A pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells    .
If cancer cells are found , the doctor may remove as much tumor as safely possible during the same surgery    .
The pathologist checks the cancer cells to find out the type and grade of brain tumor    .
The grade of the tumor is based on how abnormal the cancer cells look under a microscope and how quickly the tumor is likely to grow and spread    .
The following test may be done on the sample of tissue that is removed : - Immunohistochemistry :
A test that uses antibodies to check for certain antigens in a sample of tissue    .
The antibody is usually linked to a radioactive substance or a dye that causes the tissue to light up under a microscope    .
This type of test may be used to tell the difference between different types of cancer    .
Some childhood brain and spinal cord tumors are diagnosed by imaging tests    .
Sometimes a biopsy or surgery cannot be done safely because of where the tumor formed in the brain or spinal cord    .
These tumors are diagnosed based on the results of imaging tests and other procedures    .
What is the outlook for Childhood Brain and Spinal Cord Tumors ?

Certain factors affect prognosis ( chance of recovery )    .
The prognosis ( chance of recovery ) depends on the following : - Whether there are any cancer cells left after surgery    .
- The type of tumor    .    - Where the tumor is in the body    .
- The child 's age    .
- Whether the tumor has just been diagnosed or has recurred ( come back )    .
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Childhood Brain and Spinal Cord Tumors ?

New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials    .
This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials    .
It may not mention every new treatment being studied    .
Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website    .
High - dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant High - dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant is a way of giving high doses of chemotherapy and replacing blood - forming cells destroyed by the cancer treatment    .
Stem cells ( immature blood cells ) are removed from the blood or bone marrow of the patient or a donor and are frozen and stored    .
After the chemotherapy is completed , the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion    .
These reinfused stem cells grow into ( and restore ) the bodys blood cells    .
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
For some patients , taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice    .
Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process    .
Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment    .
Many of today 's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials    .
Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment    .
Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future    .
Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments , they often answer important questions and help move research forward    .
Patients can enter clinical trials before , during , or after starting their cancer treatment    .
Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment    .
Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better    .
There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring ( coming back ) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment    .
Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country    .
Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website    .
What are the treatments for Childhood Brain and Spinal Cord Tumors ?

Key Points

There are different types of treatment for children with brain and spinal cord tumors    .
Different types of treatment are available for children with brain and spinal cord tumors    .
Some treatments are standard ( the currently used treatment ) , and some are being tested in clinical trials    .
A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer    .
When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment , the new treatment may become the standard treatment    .
Because cancer in children is rare , taking part in a clinical trial should be considered    .
Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country    .
Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment    .
Children with brain or spinal cord tumors should have their treatment planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating childhood brain and spinal cord tumors    .
Treatment will be overseen by a pediatric oncologist , a doctor who specializes in treating children with cancer    .
The pediatric oncologist works with other health care providers who are experts in treating children with brain tumors and who specialize in certain areas of medicine    .
These may include the following specialists : - Pediatrician    .    - Neurosurgeon    .    - Neurologist    .    - Neuro - oncologist    .
- Neuropathologist    .
- Neuroradiologist    .
- Radiation oncologist    .
- Endocrinologist    .    - Psychologist    .    - Ophthalmologist    .
- Rehabilitation specialist    .
- Social worker    .
- Nurse specialist    .
Childhood brain and spinal cord tumors may cause signs or symptoms that begin before the cancer is diagnosed and continue for months or years    .
Childhood brain and spinal cord tumors may cause signs or symptoms that continue for months or years    .
Signs or symptoms caused by the tumor may begin before diagnosis    .
Signs or symptoms caused by treatment may begin during or right after treatment    .
Some cancer treatments cause side effects months or years after treatment has ended    .
These are called late effects    .
Late effects of cancer treatment may include the following : - Physical problems    .
- Changes in mood , feelings , thinking , learning , or memory    .
- Second cancers ( new types of cancer )    .
Some late effects may be treated or controlled    .
It is important to talk with your child 's doctors about the effects cancer treatment can have on your child    .
( See the PDQ summary on Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer for more information )    .
Three types of standard treatment are used :
Surgery Surgery may be used to diagnose and treat childhood brain and spinal cord tumors    .
See the General Information section of this summary    .
Radiation therapy Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high - energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing    .
There are two types of radiation therapy : - External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer    .
- Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles , seeds , wires , or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer    .
The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type of cancer being treated    .
External radiation therapy is used to treat childhood brain and spinal cord tumors    .
Chemotherapy Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells , either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing    .
When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle , the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body ( systemic chemotherapy )    .
When chemotherapy is placed directly in the cerebrospinal fluid , an organ , or a body cavity such as the abdomen , the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas ( regional chemotherapy )    .
The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated    .
Anticancer drugs given by mouth or vein to treat brain and spinal cord tumors cannot cross the blood - brain barrier and enter the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord    .
Instead , an anticancer drug is injected into the fluid - filled space to kill cancer cells there    .
This is called intrathecal chemotherapy    .
New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials    .
This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials    .

Follow - up tests may be needed    .
Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated    .
Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working    .
Decisions about whether to continue , change , or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests    .
Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended    .
The results of these tests can show if your child 's condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred ( come back )    .
These tests are sometimes called follow - up tests or check - ups    .
What is (are) Childhood Astrocytomas ?

Key Points
- Childhood astrocytoma is a disease in which benign ( noncancer ) or malignant ( cancer ) cells form in the tissues of the brain    .
- Astrocytomas may be benign ( not cancer ) or malignant ( cancer )    .    - The central nervous system controls many important body functions    .
- The cause of most childhood brain tumors is not known    .
- The signs and symptoms of astrocytomas are not the same in every child    .
- Tests that examine the brain and spinal cord are used to detect ( find ) childhood astrocytomas    .
- Childhood astrocytomas are usually diagnosed and removed in surgery    .
- Certain factors affect prognosis ( chance of recovery ) and treatment options    .
Childhood astrocytoma is a disease in which benign ( noncancer ) or malignant ( cancer ) cells form in the tissues of the brain    .
Astrocytomas are tumors that start in star - shaped brain cells called astrocytes    .
An astrocyte is a type of glial cell    .
Glial cells hold nerve cells in place , bring food and oxygen to them , and help protect them from disease , such as infection    .
Gliomas are tumors that form from glial cells    .
An astrocytoma is a type of glioma    .
Astrocytoma is the most common type of glioma diagnosed in children    .
It can form anywhere in the central nervous system ( brain and spinal cord )    .
This summary is about the treatment of tumors that begin in astrocytes in the brain ( primary brain tumors )    .
Metastatic brain tumors are formed by cancer cells that begin in other parts of the body and spread to the brain    .
Treatment of metastatic brain tumors is not discussed here    .
Brain tumors can occur in both children and adults    .
However , treatment for children may be different than treatment for adults    .
See the following PDQ summaries for more information about other types of brain tumors in children and adults : - Childhood Brain and Spinal Cord Tumors Treatment Overview - Adult Central Nervous System Tumors Treatment
Astrocytomas may be benign ( not cancer ) or malignant ( cancer )    .
Benign brain tumors grow and press on nearby areas of the brain    .
They rarely spread into other tissues    .
Malignant brain tumors are likely to grow quickly and spread into other brain tissue    .
When a tumor grows into or presses on an area of the brain , it may stop that part of the brain from working the way it should    .
Both benign and malignant brain tumors can cause signs and symptoms and almost all need treatment    .
The central nervous system controls many important body functions    .
Astrocytomas are most common in these parts of the central nervous system ( CNS ) : - Cerebrum :
The largest part of the brain , at the top of the head    .
The cerebrum controls thinking , learning , problem - solving , speech , emotions , reading , writing , and voluntary movement    .
- Cerebellum :
The lower , back part of the brain ( near the middle of the back of the head )    .
The cerebellum controls movement , balance , and posture    .
- Brain stem :
The part that connects the brain to the spinal cord , in the lowest part of the brain ( just above the back of the neck )    .
The brain stem controls breathing , heart rate , and the nerves and muscles used in seeing , hearing , walking , talking , and eating    .
- Hypothalamus :
The area in the middle of the base of the brain    .
It controls body temperature , hunger , and thirst    .
- Visual pathway :
The group of nerves that connect the eye with the brain    .
- Spinal cord :
The column of nerve tissue that runs from the brain stem down the center of the back    .
It is covered by three thin layers of tissue called membranes    .
The spinal cord and membranes are surrounded by the vertebrae ( back bones )    .
Spinal cord nerves carry messages between the brain and the rest of the body , such as a message from the brain to cause muscles to move or a message from the skin to the brain to feel touch    .
What causes Childhood Astrocytomas ?

The cause of most childhood brain tumors is not known    .
Who is at risk for Childhood Astrocytomas? ?

Anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor    .
Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer ; not having risk factors doesnt mean that you will not get cancer    .
Talk with your child 's doctor if you think your child may be at risk    .
Possible risk factors for astrocytoma include : - Past radiation therapy to the brain    .
- Having certain genetic disorders , such as neurofibromatosis type 1 ( NF1 ) or tuberous sclerosis    .
What are the symptoms of Childhood Astrocytomas ?

The signs and symptoms of astrocytomas are not the same in every child    .
Signs and symptoms depend on the following : - Where the tumor forms in the brain or spinal cord    .
- The size of the tumor    .
- How fast the tumor grows    .
- The child 's age and development    .
Some tumors do not cause signs or symptoms    .
Signs and symptoms may be caused by childhood astrocytomas or by other conditions    .
Check with your child 's doctor if your child has any of the following : - Morning headache or headache that goes away after vomiting    .
- Nausea and vomiting    .
- Vision , hearing , and speech problems    .
- Loss of balance and trouble walking    .
- Worsening handwriting or slow speech    .
- Weakness or change in feeling on one side of the body    .
- Unusual sleepiness    .    - More or less energy than usual    .
- Change in personality or behavior    .
- Seizures    .    - Weight loss or weight gain for no known reason    .
- Increase in the size of the head ( in infants )    .
How to diagnose Childhood Astrocytomas ?

Tests that examine the brain and spinal cord are used to detect ( find ) childhood astrocytomas    .
The following tests and procedures may be used : - Physical exam and history :
An exam of the body to check general signs of health    .
This includes checking for signs of disease , such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual    .
A history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken    .
- Neurological exam :
A series of questions and tests to check the brain , spinal cord , and nerve function    .
The exam checks a persons mental status , coordination , and ability to walk normally , and how well the muscles , senses , and reflexes work    .
This may also be called a neuro exam or a neurologic exam    .
- Visual field exam :
An exam to check a persons field of vision ( the total area in which objects can be seen )    .
This test measures both central vision ( how much a person can see when looking straight ahead ) and peripheral vision ( how much a person can see in all other directions while staring straight ahead )    .
The eyes are tested one at a time    .
The eye not being tested is covered    .
- MRI ( magnetic resonance imaging ) with gadolinium :
A procedure that uses a magnet , radio waves , and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of the brain and spinal cord    .
A substance called gadolinium is injected into a vein    .
The gadolinium collects around the cancer cells so they show up brighter in the picture    .
This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging ( NMRI )    .
Sometimes magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( MRS ) is done during the same MRI scan to look at the chemical makeup of the brain tissue    .
Childhood astrocytomas are usually diagnosed and removed in surgery    .
If doctors think there may be an astrocytoma , a biopsy may be done to remove a sample of tissue    .
For tumors in the brain , a part of the skull is removed and a needle is used to remove tissue    .
Sometimes , the needle is guided by a computer    .
A pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells    .
If cancer cells are found , the doctor may remove as much tumor as safely possible during the same surgery    .
Because it can be hard to tell the difference between types of brain tumors , you may want to have your child 's tissue sample checked by a pathologist who has experience in diagnosing brain tumors    .
The following test may be done on the tissue that was removed : - Immunohistochemistry :
A test that uses antibodies to check for certain antigens in a sample of tissue    .
The antibody is usually linked to a radioactive substance or a dye that causes the tissue to light up under a microscope    .
This type of test may be used to tell the difference between different types of cancer    .
An MIB - 1 test is a type of immunohistochemistry that checks tumor tissue for an antigen called MIB - 1    .
This may show how fast a tumor is growing    .
Sometimes tumors form in a place that makes them hard to remove    .
If removing the tumor may cause severe physical , emotional , or learning problems , a biopsy is done and more treatment is given after the biopsy    .
Children who have NF1 may form a low - grade astrocytoma in the area of the brain that controls vision and may not need a biopsy    .
If the tumor does not continue to grow or symptoms do not occur , surgery to remove the tumor may not be needed    .
What is the outlook for Childhood Astrocytomas ?

Certain factors affect prognosis ( chance of recovery ) and treatment options    .
The prognosis ( chance of recovery ) and treatment options depend on the following : - Whether the tumor is a low - grade or high - grade astrocytoma    .    - Where the tumor has formed in the CNS and if it has spread to nearby tissue or to other parts of the body    .
- How fast the tumor is growing    .
- The child 's age    .
- Whether cancer cells remain after surgery    .
- Whether there are changes in certain genes    .
- Whether the child has NF1 or tuberous sclerosis    .
- Whether the child has diencephalic syndrome ( a condition which slows physical growth )    .
- Whether the child has intracranial hypertension ( cerebrospinal fluid pressure within the skull is high ) at the time of diagnosis    .
- Whether the astrocytoma has just been diagnosed or has recurred ( come back )    .
For recurrent astrocytoma , prognosis and treatment depend on how much time passed between the time treatment ended and the time the astrocytoma recurred    .
What are the stages of Childhood Astrocytomas ?

Key Points
- The grade of the tumor is used to plan cancer treatment    .
- Low - grade astrocytomas - High - grade astrocytomas - An MRI is done after surgery    .
The grade of the tumor is used to plan cancer treatment    .
Staging is the process used to find out how much cancer there is and if cancer has spread    .
It is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment    .
There is no standard staging system for childhood astrocytoma    .
Treatment is based on the following : - Whether the tumor is low grade or high grade    .
- Whether the tumor is newly diagnosed or recurrent ( has come back after treatment )    .
The grade of the tumor describes how abnormal the cancer cells look under a microscope and how quickly the tumor is likely to grow and spread    .
The following grades are used : Low - grade astrocytomas
Low - grade astrocytomas are slow - growing and rarely spread to other parts of the brain and spinal cord or other parts of the body    .
There are many types of low - grade astrocytomas    .
Low - grade astrocytomas can be either : - Grade I tumors pilocytic astrocytoma , subependymal giant cell tumor , or angiocentric glioma    .
- Grade II tumors diffuse astrocytoma , pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma , or choroid glioma of the third ventricle    .
Children who have neurofibromatosis type 1 may have more than one low - grade tumor in the brain    .
Children who have tuberous sclerosis have an increased risk of subependymal giant cell astrocytoma    .
High - grade astrocytomas
High - grade astrocytomas are fast - growing and often spread within the brain and spinal cord    .
There are several types of high - grade astrocytomas    .
High grade astrocytomas can be either : - Grade III tumors anaplastic astrocytoma or anaplastic pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma    .
- Grade IV tumors glioblastoma or diffuse midline glioma    .
Childhood astrocytomas usually do not spread to other parts of the body    .
An MRI is done after surgery    .
An MRI ( magnetic resonance imaging ) is done in the first few days after surgery    .
This is to find out how much tumor , if any , remains after surgery and to plan further treatment    .
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Childhood Astrocytomas ?

New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials    .

Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment    .
Children with astrocytomas should have their treatment planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating childhood brain tumors    .
Treatment will be overseen by a pediatric oncologist , a doctor who specializes in treating children with cancer    .
The pediatric oncologist works with other healthcare providers who are experts in treating children with brain tumors and who specialize in certain areas of medicine    .
These may include the following specialists : - Pediatrician    .    - Pediatric neurosurgeon    .    - Neurologist    .    - Neuropathologist    .
- Neuroradiologist    .
- Rehabilitation specialist    .
- Radiation oncologist    .
- Endocrinologist    .    - Psychologist    .
Childhood brain tumors may cause signs or symptoms that begin before the cancer is diagnosed and continue for months or years    .
Signs or symptoms caused by the tumor may begin before diagnosis    .
These signs or symptoms may continue for months or years    .
It is important to talk with your child 's doctors about signs or symptoms caused by the tumor that may continue after treatment    .
Some cancer treatments cause side effects months or years after treatment has ended    .
Side effects from cancer treatment that begin during or after treatment and continue for months or years are called late effects    .
Late effects of cancer treatment may include the following : - Physical problems    .
- Changes in mood , feelings , thinking , learning , or memory    .
- Second cancers ( new types of cancer )    .
Some late effects may be treated or controlled    .
It is important to talk with your child 's doctors about the effects cancer treatment can have on your child    .
( See the PDQ summary on Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer for more information    .    )
Six types of treatment are used :
Surgery Surgery is used to diagnose and treat childhood astrocytoma , as discussed in the General Information section of this summary    .
If cancer cells remain after surgery , further treatment depends on : - Where the remaining cancer cells are    .
- The grade of the tumor    .    - The age of the child    .
Even if the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery , some patients may be given chemotherapy or radiation therapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that remain    .
Treatment given after the surgery , to lower the risk that the cancer will come back , is called adjuvant therapy    .
Observation Observation is closely monitoring a patients condition without giving any treatment until signs or symptoms appear or change    .
Observation may be used : - If the patient has no symptoms , such as patients with neurofibromatosis type1    .
- If the tumor is small and is found when a different health problem is being diagnosed or treated    .
- After the tumor is removed by surgery until signs or symptoms appear or change    .
Radiation therapy Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high - energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing    .
There are two types of radiation therapy : - External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer    .
Certain ways of giving radiation therapy can help keep radiation from damaging nearby healthy tissue    .
These types of radiation therapy include the following : - Conformal radiation therapy : Conformal radiation therapy is a type of external radiation therapy that uses a computer to make a 3 - dimensional ( 3 - D ) picture of the tumor and shapes the radiation beams to fit the tumor    .
- Intensity - modulated radiation therapy ( IMRT ) : IMRT is a type of 3 - dimensional ( 3 - D ) external radiation therapy that uses a computer to make pictures of the size and shape of the tumor    .
Thin beams of radiation of different intensities ( strengths ) are aimed at the tumor from many angles    .
- Stereotactic radiation therapy : Stereotactic radiation therapy is a type of external radiation therapy    .
A rigid head frame is attached to the skull to keep the head still during the radiation treatment    .
A machine aims radiation directly at the tumor    .
The total dose of radiation is divided into several smaller doses given over several days    .
This procedure is also called stereotactic external - beam radiation therapy and stereotaxic radiation therapy    .
- Proton beam radiation therapy : Proton - beam therapy is a type of high - energy , external radiation therapy    .
A radiation therapy machine aims streams of protons ( tiny , invisible , positively - charged particles ) at the cancer cells to kill them    .
- Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles , seeds , wires , or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer    .
The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type of tumor and where the tumor formed in the brain or spinal cord    .
External radiation therapy is used to treat childhood astrocytomas    .
Radiation therapy to the brain can affect growth and development , especially in young children    .
For children younger than 3 years , chemotherapy may be given instead , to delay or reduce the need for radiation therapy    .
Chemotherapy Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells , either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing    .
When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle , the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body ( systemic chemotherapy )    .
When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid , an organ , or a body cavity such as the abdomen , the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas ( regional chemotherapy )    .
Combination chemotherapy is the use of more than one anticancer drug    .
The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type of tumor and where the tumor formed in the brain or spinal cord    .
Systemic combination chemotherapy is used in the treatment of children with astrocytoma    .
High - dose chemotherapy may be used in the treatment of children with newly diagnosed high - grade astrocytoma    .
High - dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant High - dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant is a way of giving high doses of chemotherapy and replacing blood - forming cells destroyed by the cancer treatment    .
Stem cells ( immature blood cells ) are removed from the blood or bone marrow of the patient or a donor and are frozen and stored    .
After the chemotherapy is completed , the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion    .
These reinfused stem cells grow into ( and restore ) the body 's blood cells    .
For high - grade astrocytoma that has come back after treatment , high - dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant is used if there is only a small amount of tumor    .
Targeted therapy Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells    .
There are different types of targeted therapy : - Monoclonal antibody therapy uses antibodies made in the laboratory , from a single type of immune system cell , to stop cancer cells    .
These antibodies can identify substances on cancer cells or normal substances that may help cancer cells grow    .
The antibodies attach to the substances and kill the cancer cells , block their growth , or keep them from spreading    .
Monoclonal antibodies are given by infusion into a vein    .
They may be used alone or to carry drugs , toxins , or radioactive material directly to cancer cells    .
There are different types of monoclonal antibody therapy : - Vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) inhibitor therapy : Cancer cells make a substance called VEGF , which causes new blood vessels to form ( angiogenesis ) and helps the cancer grow    .
VEGF inhibitors block VEGF and stop new blood vessels from forming    .
This may kill cancer cells because they need new blood vessels to grow    .
Bevacizumab is a VEGF inhibitor and angiogenesis inhibitor being used to treat childhood astrocytoma    .
- Immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy : PD - 1 is a protein on the surface of T cells that helps keep the bodys immune responses in check    .
When PD - 1 attaches to another protein called PDL - 1 on a cancer cell , it stops the T cell from killing the cancer cell    .
PD - 1 inhibitors attach to PDL - 1 and allow the T cells to kill cancer cells    .
PD - 1 inhibitors are being studied to treat high - grade astrocytoma that has recurred    .
- Protein kinase inhibitors work in different ways    .
There are several kinds of protein kinase inhibitors    .
- mTOR inhibitors stop cells from dividing and may prevent the growth of new blood vessels that tumors need to grow    .
Everolimus and sirolimus are mTOR inhibitors used to treat childhood subependymal giant cell astrocytomas    .
mTOR inhibitors also are being studied to treat low - grade astrocytoma that has recurred    .
- BRAF inhibitors block proteins needed for cell growth and may kill cancer cells    .
The BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib is being studied to treat low - grade astrocytoma that has recurred    .
Vemurafenib and dabrafenib have been used to treat high - grade astrocytomas that have recurred but more study is needed to know how well they work in children    .
- MEK inhibitors block proteins needed for cell growth and may kill cancer cells    .
MEK inhibitors such as selumetinib are being studied to treat low - grade astrocytoma that has recurred    .
See Drugs Approved for Brain Tumors for more information    .
New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials    .
This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials    .
It may not mention every new treatment being studied    .
Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website    .
Other drug therapy Lenalidomide is a type of angiogenesis inhibitor    .
It prevents the growth of new blood vessels that are needed by a tumor to grow    .
If fluid builds up around the brain and spinal cord , a cerebrospinal fluid diversion procedure may be done    .
Cerebrospinal fluid diversion is a method used to drain fluid that has built up around the brain and spinal cord    .
A shunt ( long , thin tube ) is placed in a ventricle ( fluid - filled space ) of the brain and threaded under the skin to another part of the body , usually the abdomen    .
The shunt carries extra fluid away from the brain so it may be absorbed elsewhere in the body    .
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
For some patients , taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice    .
Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process    .
Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment    .
Many of today 's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials    .
Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment    .
Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future    .
Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments , they often answer important questions and help move research forward    .
Patients can enter clinical trials before , during , or after starting their cancer treatment    .
Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment    .
Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better    .
There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring ( coming back ) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment    .
Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country    .
See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials    .
These have been retrieved from NCI 's listing of clinical trials    .
Follow - up tests may be needed    .
Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated    .
( See the General Information section for a list of tests    .    )
Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working    .
Decisions about whether to continue , change , or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests    .
Regular MRIs will continue to be done after treatment has ended    .
The results of the MRI can show if your child 's condition has changed or if the astrocytoma has recurred ( come back )    .
If the results of the MRI show a mass in the brain , a biopsy may be done to find out if it is made up of dead tumor cells or if new cancer cells are growing    .
Treatment Options for Childhood Astrocytomas
Newly Diagnosed Childhood Low - Grade Astrocytomas
When the tumor is first diagnosed , treatment for childhood low - grade astrocytoma depends on where the tumor is , and is usually surgery    .
An MRI is done after surgery to see if there is tumor remaining    .
If the tumor was completely removed by surgery , more treatment may not be needed and the child is closely watched to see if signs or symptoms appear or change    .
This is called observation    .
If there is tumor remaining after surgery , treatment may include the following : - Observation    .    - A second surgery to remove the tumor    .
- Radiation therapy , which may include conformal radiation therapy , intensity - modulated radiation therapy , proton beam radiation therapy , or stereotactic radiation therapy , when the tumor begins to grow again    .
- Combination chemotherapy with or without radiation therapy    .
In some cases , observation is used for children who have a visual pathway glioma    .
In other cases , treatment may include surgery to remove the tumor , radiation therapy , or chemotherapy    .
A goal of treatment is to save as much vision as possible    .
The effect of tumor growth on the child 's vision will be closely followed during treatment    .
Children with neurofibromatosis type 1 ( NF1 ) may not need treatment unless the tumor grows or signs or symptoms , such as vision problems , appear    .
When the tumor grows or signs or symptoms appear , treatment may include surgery to remove the tumor , radiation therapy , and / or chemotherapy    .
Children with tuberous sclerosis may develop benign ( not cancer ) tumors in the brain called subependymal giant cell astrocytomas ( SEGAs )    .
Targeted therapy with everolimus or sirolimus may be used instead of surgery , to shrink the tumors    .

For more specific results , refine the search by using other search features , such as the location of the trial , the type of treatment , or the name of the drug    .
Talk with your child 's doctor about clinical trials that may be right for your child    .
General information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website    .
Recurrent Childhood Low - Grade Astrocytomas
When low - grade astrocytoma recurs after treatment , it usually comes back where the tumor first formed    .
Before more cancer treatment is given , imaging tests , biopsy , or surgery are done to find out if there is cancer and how much there is    .
Treatment of recurrent childhood low - grade astrocytoma may include the following : - A second surgery to remove the tumor , if surgery was the only treatment given when the tumor was first diagnosed    .
- Radiation therapy to the tumor only , if radiation therapy was not used when the tumor was first diagnosed    .
Conformal radiation therapy may be given    .
- Chemotherapy , if the tumor recurred where it cannot be removed by surgery or the patient had radiation therapy when the tumor was first diagnosed    .
- Targeted therapy with a monoclonal antibody ( bevacizumab ) with or without chemotherapy    .    - A clinical trial of targeted therapy with a BRAF inhibitor ( dabrafenib ) , an mTOR inhibitor ( everolimus ) , or a MEK inhibitor ( selumetinib )    .    - A clinical trial of lenalidomide    .
Check the list of NCI - supported cancer clinical trials that are now accepting patients with recurrent childhood astrocytoma or other tumor of glial origin    .

What is (are) Childhood Central Nervous System Atypical Teratoid/Rhabdoid Tumor ?

Key Points
- Central nervous system atypical teratoid / rhabdoid tumor is a disease in which malignant ( cancer ) cells form in the tissues of the brain    .
- Certain genetic changes may increase the risk of atypical teratoid / rhabdoid tumor    .    - The signs and symptoms of atypical teratoid / rhabdoid tumor are not the same in every patient    .
- Tests that examine the brain and spinal cord are used to detect ( find ) CNS atypical teratoid / rhabdoid tumor    .
- Childhood atypical teratoid / rhabdoid tumor is diagnosed and may be removed in surgery    .
- Certain factors affect prognosis ( chance of recovery ) and treatment options    .
Central nervous system atypical teratoid / rhabdoid tumor is a disease in which malignant ( cancer ) cells form in the tissues of the brain    .
Central nervous system ( CNS ) atypical teratoid / rhabdoid tumor ( AT / RT ) is a very rare , fast - growing tumor of the brain and spinal cord    .
It usually occurs in children aged three years and younger , although it can occur in older children and adults    .
About half of these tumors form in the cerebellum or brain stem    .
The cerebellum is the part of the brain that controls movement , balance , and posture    .
The brain stem controls breathing , heart rate , and the nerves and muscles used in seeing , hearing , walking , talking , and eating    .
AT / RT may also be found in other parts of the central nervous system ( brain and spinal cord )    .
This summary describes the treatment of primary brain tumors ( tumors that begin in the brain )    .
Treatment for metastatic brain tumors , which are tumors formed by cancer cells that begin in other parts of the body and spread to the brain , is not covered in this summary    .
For more information , see the PDQ summary on Childhood Brain and Spinal Cord Tumors Treatment Overview about the different types of childhood brain and spinal cord tumors    .
Brain tumors can occur in both children and adults ; however , treatment for children may be different than treatment for adults    .
See the PDQ treatment summary on Adult Central Nervous System Tumors Treatment for more information    .
Who is at risk for Childhood Central Nervous System Atypical Teratoid/Rhabdoid Tumor? ?

Certain genetic changes may increase the risk of atypical teratoid / rhabdoid tumor    .
Anything that increases the risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor    .
Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer ; not having risk factors doesnt mean that you will not get cancer    .
Talk with your child 's doctor if you think your child may be at risk    .
Atypical teratoid / rhabdoid tumor may be linked to changes in the tumor suppressor genes SMARCB1 or SMARCA4    .
Genes of this type make a protein that helps control cell growth    .
Changes in the DNA of tumor suppressor genes like SMARCB1 or SMARCA4 may lead to cancer    .
Changes in the SMARCB1 or SMARCA4 genes may be inherited ( passed on from parents to offspring )    .
When this gene change is inherited , tumors may form in two parts of the body at the same time ( for example , in the brain and the kidney )    .
For patients with AT / RT , genetic counseling ( a discussion with a trained professional about inherited diseases and a possible need for gene testing ) may be recommended    .
What are the symptoms of Childhood Central Nervous System Atypical Teratoid/Rhabdoid Tumor ?

The signs and symptoms of atypical teratoid / rhabdoid tumor are not the same in every patient    .
Signs and symptoms depend on the following : - The child 's age    .
- Where the tumor has formed    .
Because atypical teratoid / rhabdoid tumor is fast growing , signs and symptoms may develop quickly and get worse over a period of days or weeks    .
Signs and symptoms may be caused by AT / RT or by other conditions    .
Check with your child 's doctor if your child has any of the following : - Morning headache or headache that goes away after vomiting    .
- Nausea and vomiting    .
- Unusual sleepiness or change in activity level    .
- Loss of balance , lack of coordination , or trouble walking    .
- Increase in head size ( in infants )    .
How to diagnose Childhood Central Nervous System Atypical Teratoid/Rhabdoid Tumor ?

Tests that examine the brain and spinal cord are used to detect ( find ) CNS atypical teratoid / rhabdoid tumor    .
The following tests and procedures may be used : - Physical exam and history :
An exam of the body to check general signs of health , including checking for signs of disease , such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual    .
A history of the patient 's health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken    .
- Neurological exam :
A series of questions and tests to check the brain , spinal cord , and nerve function    .
The exam checks a persons mental status , coordination , and ability to walk normally , and how well the muscles , senses , and reflexes work    .
This may also be called a neuro exam or a neurologic exam    .
- MRI ( magnetic resonance imaging ) : A procedure that uses a magnet , radio waves , and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the brain and spinal cord    .
This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging ( NMRI )    .
- Lumbar puncture : A procedure used to collect cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) from the spinal column    .
This is done by placing a needle between two bones in the spine and into the CSF around the spinal cord and removing a sample of fluid    .
The sample of CSF is checked under a microscope for signs of tumor cells    .
The sample may also be checked for the amounts of protein and glucose    .
A higher than normal amount of protein or lower than normal amount of glucose may be a sign of a tumor    .
This procedure is also called an LP or spinal tap    .
- SMARCB1 and SMARCA4 gene testing : A laboratory test in which a sample of blood or tissue is tested for the SMARCB1 and SMARCA4 genes    .
Childhood atypical teratoid / rhabdoid tumor is diagnosed and may be removed in surgery    .
If doctors think there might be a brain tumor , a biopsy may be done to remove a sample of tissue    .
For tumors in the brain , the biopsy is done by removing part of the skull and using a needle to remove a sample of tissue    .
A pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells    .
If cancer cells are found , the doctor may remove as much tumor as safely possible during the same surgery    .
The pathologist checks the cancer cells to find out the type of brain tumor    .
It is often difficult to completely remove AT / RT because of where the tumor is in the brain and because it may already have spread at the time of diagnosis    .

The following test may be done on the sample of tissue that is removed : - Immunohistochemistry :
A test that uses antibodies to check for certain antigens in a sample of tissue    .
The antibody is usually linked to a radioactive substance or a dye that causes the tissue to light up under a microscope    .
This test is used to tell the difference between AT / RT and other brain tumors    .
What is the outlook for Childhood Central Nervous System Atypical Teratoid/Rhabdoid Tumor ?

Certain factors affect prognosis ( chance of recovery ) and treatment options    .
The prognosis ( chance of recovery ) and treatment options depend on the following : - Whether there are certain inherited gene changes    .
- The age of the child    .
- The amount of tumor remaining after surgery    .
- Whether the cancer has spread to other parts of the central nervous system ( brain and spinal cord ) or to the kidney at the time of diagnosis    .
What are the stages of Childhood Central Nervous System Atypical Teratoid/Rhabdoid Tumor ?

Key Points
- There is no standard staging system for central nervous system atypical teratoid / rhabdoid tumor    .
There is no standard staging system for central nervous system atypical teratoid / rhabdoid tumor    .
The extent or spread of cancer is usually described as stages    .
There is no standard staging system for central nervous system atypical teratoid / rhabdoid tumor    .
For treatment , this tumor is grouped as newly diagnosed or recurrent    .
Treatment depends on the following : - The age of the child    .
- How much cancer remains after surgery to remove the tumor    .
Results from the following procedure are also used to plan treatment : - Ultrasound exam :
A procedure in which high - energy sound waves ( ultrasound ) are bounced off internal tissues or organs , such as the kidney , and make echoes    .
The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram    .
The picture can be printed to be looked at later    .
This procedure is done to check for tumors that may also have formed in the kidney    .

Treatment given after the surgery , to lower the risk that the cancer will come back , is called adjuvant therapy    .
Chemotherapy Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells , either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing    .
- When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid , an organ , or a body cavity such as the abdomen , the drugs mainly affect tumor cells in those areas ( regional chemotherapy )    .
Regular doses of anticancer drugs given by mouth or vein to treat brain and spinal cord tumors cannot cross the blood - brain barrier and reach the tumor    .
Anticancer drugs injected into the cerebrospinal fluid are able to reach the tumor    .
This is called intrathecal chemotherapy    .
- When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle , the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach tumor cells throughout the body ( systemic chemotherapy )    .
High doses of some anticancer drugs given into a vein can cross the blood - brain barrier and reach the tumor    .
Radiation therapy Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high - energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing    .
There are two types of radiation therapy : - External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer    .
- Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles , seeds , wires , or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer    .
The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type of tumor being treated and whether it has spread    .
External radiation therapy may be given to the brain and spinal cord    .
Because radiation therapy can affect growth and brain development in young children , especially children who are three years old or younger , the dose of radiation therapy may be lower than in older children    .
High - dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant High - dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant is a method of giving high doses of chemotherapy and replacing blood - forming cells destroyed by the cancer treatment    .
Stem cells ( immature blood cells ) are removed from the blood or bone marrow of the patient or a donor and are frozen and stored    .
After the chemotherapy is completed , the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion    .
These reinfused stem cells grow into ( and restore ) the bodys blood cells    .
New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials    .
This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials    .
It may not mention every new treatment being studied    .
Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website    .
Targeted therapy Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to attack specific cancer cells    .
Targeted therapies usually cause less harm to normal cells than chemotherapy or radiation therapy do    .
Targeted therapy is being studied in the treatment of recurrent childhood central nervous system atypical teratoid / rhabdoid tumor    .
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
For some patients , taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice    .
Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process    .
Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment    .
Many of today 's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials    .
Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment    .
Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future    .
Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments , they often answer important questions and help move research forward    .
Patients can enter clinical trials before , during , or after starting their cancer treatment    .
Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment    .
Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better    .
There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring ( coming back ) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment    .
Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country    .
See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials    .
These have been retrieved from NCI 's listing of clinical trials    .
Follow - up tests may be needed    .
Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer may be repeated    .
Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working    .
Decisions about whether to continue , change , or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests    .
Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended    .
The results of these tests can show if your child 's condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred ( come back )    .
These tests are sometimes called follow - up tests or check - ups    .
Treatment Options for Newly Diagnosed Childhood CNS Atypical Teratoid / Rhabdoid Tumor

Key Points
- There is no standard treatment for patients with central nervous system atypical teratoid / rhabdoid tumor    .
- Combinations of treatments are used for patients with atypical teratoid / rhabdoid tumor    .
There is no standard treatment for patients with central nervous system atypical teratoid / rhabdoid tumor    .
Combinations of treatments are used for patients with atypical teratoid / rhabdoid tumor    .
Because atypical teratoid / rhabdoid tumor ( AT / RT ) is fast - growing , a combination of treatments is usually given    .
After surgery to remove the tumor , treatments for AT / RT may include combinations of the following : - Chemotherapy    .
- Radiation therapy    .    - High - dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant    .
Clinical trials of new treatments should be considered for patients with newly diagnosed atypical teratoid / rhabdoid tumor    .
What is (are) Childhood Brain Stem Glioma ?

Key Points
- Childhood brain stem glioma is a disease in which benign ( noncancer ) or malignant ( cancer ) cells form in the tissues of the brain stem    .
- Brain tumors may be benign ( not cancer ) or malignant ( cancer )    .    - There are two types of brain stem gliomas in children    .
- The cause of most childhood brain tumors is unknown    .
- The signs and symptoms of brain stem glioma are not the same in every child    .
- Tests that examine the brain are used to detect ( find ) childhood brain stem glioma    .    - A biopsy may be done to diagnose certain types of brain stem glioma    .
- Certain factors affect prognosis ( chance of recovery ) and treatment options    .
Childhood brain stem glioma is a disease in which benign ( noncancer ) or malignant ( cancer ) cells form in the tissues of the brain stem    .
Gliomas are tumors formed from glial cells    .
Glial cells in the brain hold nerve cells in place , bring food and oxygen to them , and help protect them from disease , such as infection    .
The brain stem is the part of the brain connected to the spinal cord    .
It is in the lowest part of the brain , just above the back of the neck    .
The brain stem is the part of the brain that controls breathing , heart rate , and the nerves and muscles used in seeing , hearing , walking , talking , and eating    .
Most childhood brain stem gliomas are pontine gliomas , which form in a part of the brain stem called the pons    .
Brain tumors are the third most common type of cancer in children    .
This summary refers to the treatment of primary brain tumors ( tumors that begin in the brain )    .
Treatment for metastatic brain tumors , which are tumors formed by cancer cells that begin in other parts of the body and spread to the brain , is not discussed in this summary    .
Brain tumors can occur in both children and adults ; however , treatment for children may be different than treatment for adults    .
See the following PDQ treatment summaries for more information : - Childhood Brain and Spinal Cord Tumors Treatment Overview - Adult Central Nervous System Tumors Treatment
Brain tumors may be benign ( not cancer ) or malignant ( cancer )    .
Benign brain tumors grow and press on nearby areas of the brain    .
They rarely spread into other tissues    .
Malignant brain tumors are likely to grow quickly and spread into other brain tissue    .
When a tumor grows into or presses on an area of the brain , it may stop that part of the brain from working the way it should    .
Both benign and malignant brain tumors can cause signs and symptoms and need treatment    .
There are two types of brain stem gliomas in children    .
Childhood brain stem glioma is either a diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma ( DIPG ) or a focal glioma    .
- DIPG is a high - grade tumor that is fast - growing and spreads all through the brain stem    .
It is hard to treat and has a poor prognosis ( chance of recovery )    .
Children younger than 3 years diagnosed with DIPG may have a better prognosis than children who are 3 years and older    .
- A focal glioma is slow - growing and is in one area of the brain stem    .
It is easier to treat than DIPG and has a better prognosis    .
What causes Childhood Brain Stem Glioma ?

The cause of most childhood brain tumors is unknown    .
Who is at risk for Childhood Brain Stem Glioma? ?

Anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor    .
Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer ; not having risk factors doesnt mean that you will not get cancer    .
Talk with your child 's doctor if you think your child may be at risk    .
Possible risk factors for brain stem glioma include : - Having certain genetic disorders , such as neurofibromatosis type 1 ( NF1 )    .
What are the symptoms of Childhood Brain Stem Glioma ?

The signs and symptoms of brain stem glioma are not the same in every child    .
Signs and symptoms depend on the following : - Where the tumor forms in the brain    .
- The size of the tumor and whether it has spread all through the brain stem    .
- How fast the tumor grows    .
- The child 's age and development    .
Some tumors do not cause signs or symptoms    .
Signs and symptoms may be caused by childhood brain stem gliomas or by other conditions    .
Check with your child 's doctor if your child has any of the following : - Loss of ability to move one side of the face and / or body    .
- Loss of balance and trouble walking    .
- Vision and hearing problems    .
- Morning headache or headache that goes away after vomiting    .
- Nausea and vomiting    .
- Unusual sleepiness    .    - More or less energy than usual    .
- Changes in behavior    .
- Trouble learning in school    .
How to diagnose Childhood Brain Stem Glioma ?

Tests that examine the brain are used to detect ( find ) childhood brain stem glioma    .
The following tests and procedures may be used : - Physical exam and history :
An exam of the body to check general signs of health , including checking for signs of disease , such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual    .
A history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken    .
- Neurological exam :
A series of questions and tests to check the brain , spinal cord , and nerve function    .
The exam checks a persons mental status , coordination , and ability to walk normally , and how well the muscles , senses , and reflexes work    .
This may also be called a neuro exam or a neurologic exam    .
- MRI ( magnetic resonance imaging ) with gadolinium :
A procedure that uses a magnet , radio waves , and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the brain    .
A substance called gadolinium is injected into a vein    .
The gadolinium collects around the cancer cells so they show up brighter in the picture    .
This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging ( NMRI )    .
- A biopsy may be done to diagnose certain types of brain stem glioma    .
If the MRI scan looks like the tumor is a DIPG , a biopsy is usually not done and the tumor is not removed    .
If the MRI scan looks like a focal brain stem glioma , a biopsy may be done    .
A part of the skull is removed and a needle is used to remove a sample of the brain tissue    .
Sometimes , the needle is guided by a computer    .
A pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells    .
If cancer cells are found , the doctor will remove as much tumor as safely possible during the same surgery    .
The following test may be done on the tissue that was removed : - Immunohistochemistry :
A test that uses antibodies to check for certain antigens in a sample of tissue    .
The antibody is usually linked to a radioactive substance or a dye that causes the tissue to light up under a microscope    .
This type of test may be used to tell the difference between brain stem glioma and other brain tumors    .
What is the outlook for Childhood Brain Stem Glioma ?

Certain factors affect prognosis ( chance of recovery ) and treatment options    .
The prognosis and treatment options depend on : - The type of brain stem glioma    .    - Where the tumor is found in the brain and if it has spread within the brain stem    .
- The age of the child when diagnosed    .
- Whether or not the child has a condition called neurofibromatosis type 1    .    - Whether the tumor has just been diagnosed or has recurred ( come back )    .
What are the stages of Childhood Brain Stem Glioma ?

Key Points
- The plan for cancer treatment depends on whether the tumor is in one area of the brain or has spread all through the brain    .
The plan for cancer treatment depends on whether the tumor is in one area of the brain or has spread all through the brain    .
Staging is the process used to find out how much cancer there is and if cancer has spread    .
It is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment    .
There is no standard staging system for childhood brain stem glioma    .
Treatment is based on the following : - Whether the tumor is newly diagnosed or recurrent ( has come back after treatment )    .
- The type of tumor ( either a diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma or a focal glioma )    .
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Childhood Brain Stem Glioma ?

New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials    .
Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website    .

What are the treatments for Childhood Brain Stem Glioma ?

Key Points
- There are different types of treatment for children with brain stem glioma    .
- Children with brain stem glioma should have their treatment planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating childhood brain tumors    .
- Childhood brain stem gliomas may cause signs or symptoms that begin before the cancer is diagnosed and continue for months or years    .
- Some cancer treatments cause side effects months or years after treatment has ended    .
- Six types of standard treatment are used : - Surgery - Radiation therapy - Chemotherapy - Cerebrospinal fluid diversion - Observation - Targeted therapy - New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials    .
- Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
- Patients can enter clinical trials before , during , or after starting their cancer treatment    .
- Follow - up tests may be needed    .
There are different types of treatment for children with brain stem glioma    .
Different types of treatment are available for children with brain stem glioma    .
Some treatments are standard ( the currently used treatment ) , and some are being tested in clinical trials    .
A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer    .
When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment , the new treatment may become the standard treatment    .
Because cancer in children is rare , taking part in a clinical trial should be considered    .
Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment    .
Children with brain stem glioma should have their treatment planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating childhood brain tumors    .
Treatment will be overseen by a pediatric oncologist , a doctor who specializes in treating children with cancer    .
The pediatric oncologist works with other pediatric health care providers who are experts in treating children with brain tumors and who specialize in certain areas of medicine    .
These may include the following specialists : - Pediatrician    .    - Neurosurgeon    .    - Neuropathologist    .
- Radiation oncologist    .
- Neuro - oncologist    .
- Neurologist    .    - Rehabilitation specialist    .
- Neuroradiologist    .
- Endocrinologist    .    - Psychologist    .
Childhood brain stem gliomas may cause signs or symptoms that begin before the cancer is diagnosed and continue for months or years    .

Childhood brain stem gliomas may cause signs or symptoms that continue for months or years    .
Signs or symptoms caused by the tumor may begin before diagnosis    .
Signs or symptoms caused by treatment may begin during or right after treatment    .
Some cancer treatments cause side effects months or years after treatment has ended    .
These are called late effects    .
Late effects may include the following : - Physical problems    .
- Changes in mood , feelings , thinking , learning , or memory    .
- Second cancers ( new types of cancer )    .
Some late effects may be treated or controlled    .
It is important to talk with your child 's doctors about the effects cancer treatment can have on your child    .
( See the PDQ summary on Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer for more information )    .
Six types of standard treatment are used :
Surgery Surgery may be used to diagnose and treat childhood brain stem glioma as discussed in the General Information section of this summary    .
Radiation therapy Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high - energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing    .
There are two types of radiation therapy : - External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer    .
- Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles , seeds , wires , or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer    .
The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type of the cancer being treated    .
External radiation therapy is used to treat DIPG    .
External and / or internal radiation therapy may be used to treat focal brain stem gliomas    .
Several months after radiation therapy to the brain , imaging tests may show changes to the brain tissue    .
These changes may be caused by the radiation therapy or may mean the tumor is growing    .
It is important to be sure the tumor is growing before any more treatment is given    .
Chemotherapy Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells , either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing    .
When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle , the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body ( systemic chemotherapy )    .
When chemotherapy is placed directly in the cerebrospinal fluid , an organ , or a body cavity such as the abdomen , the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas ( regional chemotherapy )    .
The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type of the cancer being treated    .
Because radiation therapy to the brain can affect growth and brain development in young children , clinical trials are studying ways of using chemotherapy to delay or reduce the need for radiation therapy    .
Cerebrospinal fluid diversion Cerebrospinal fluid diversion is a method used to drain fluid that has built up in the brain    .
A shunt ( long , thin tube ) is placed in a ventricle ( fluid - filled space ) of the brain and threaded under the skin to another part of the body , usually the abdomen    .
The shunt carries extra fluid away from the brain so it may be absorbed elsewhere in the body    .
Observation Observation is closely monitoring a patients condition without giving any treatment until signs or symptoms appear or change    .
Targeted therapy Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells    .
Some focal brain stem gliomas that cannot be removed by surgery may be treated with BRAF kinase inhibitor therapy    .
BRAF kinase inhibitors block the BRAF protein    .
BRAF proteins help control cell growth and may be mutated ( changed ) in some types of brain stem glioma    .
Blocking mutated BRAF kinase proteins may help keep cancer cells from growing    .
New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials    .
Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website    .
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
For some patients , taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice    .

Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country    .
See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials    .
These have been retrieved from NCI 's listing of clinical trials    .
Follow - up tests may be needed    .
Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated    .
Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working    .
Decisions about whether to continue , change , or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests    .
Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended    .
The results of these tests can show if your child 's condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred ( come back )    .
These tests are sometimes called follow - up tests or check - ups    .
If the results of imaging tests done after treatment show a mass in the brain , a biopsy may be done to find out if it is made up of dead tumor cells or if new cancer cells are growing    .
In children who are expected to live a long time , regular MRIs may be done to see if the cancer has come back    .
Treatment Options for Childhood Brain Stem Glioma
Newly Diagnosed Childhood Brain Stem Glioma
Newly diagnosed childhood brain stem glioma is a tumor for which no treatment has been given    .
The child may have received drugs or treatment to relieve signs or symptoms caused by the tumor    .
Standard treatment of diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma ( DIPG ) may include the following : - Radiation therapy    .
- Chemotherapy ( in infants )    .
Standard treatment of focal glioma may include the following : - Surgery that may be followed by chemotherapy and / or radiation therapy    .
- Observation for small tumors that grow slowly    .
Cerebrospinal fluid diversion may be done when there is extra fluid in the brain    .
- Internal radiation therapy with radioactive seeds , with or without chemotherapy , when the tumor cannot be removed by surgery    .
- Targeted therapy with a BRAF kinase inhibitor , for certain tumors that cannot be removed by surgery    .
Treatment of brain stem glioma in children with neurofibromatosis type 1 may be observation    .
The tumors are slow - growing in these children and may not need specific treatment for years    .
Check the list of NCI - supported cancer clinical trials that are now accepting patients with untreated childhood brain stem glioma    .
For more specific results , refine the search by using other search features , such as the location of the trial , the type of treatment , or the name of the drug    .
Talk with your child 's doctor about clinical trials that may be right for your child    .
General information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website    .
Progressive or Recurrent Childhood Brain Stem Glioma
When cancer does not get better with treatment or comes back , palliative care is an important part of the child 's treatment plan    .
It includes physical , psychological , social , and spiritual support for the child and family    .
The goal of palliative care is to help control symptoms and give the child the best quality of life possible    .
Parents may not be sure about whether to continue treatment or what kind of treatment is best for their child    .
The healthcare team can give parents information to help them make these decisions    .
There is no standard treatment for progressive or recurrent diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma    .
The child may be treated in a clinical trial of a new treatment    .
Treatment of recurrent focal childhood brain stem glioma may include the following : - A second surgery to remove the tumor    .
- External radiation therapy    .
- Chemotherapy    .    - A clinical trial of a new treatment    .
Check the list of NCI - supported cancer clinical trials that are now accepting patients with recurrent childhood brain stem glioma    .
For more specific results , refine the search by using other search features , such as the location of the trial , the type of treatment , or the name of the drug    .

What is (are) Childhood Central Nervous System Embryonal Tumors ?

Key Points
- Central nervous system ( CNS ) embryonal tumors may begin in embryonic ( fetal ) cells that remain in the brain after birth    .
- There are different types of CNS embryonal tumors    .
- Pineoblastomas form in cells of the pineal gland    .
- Certain genetic conditions increase the risk of childhood CNS embryonal tumors    .
- Signs and symptoms of childhood CNS embryonal tumors or pineoblastomas depend on the child 's age and where the tumor is    .
- Tests that examine the brain and spinal cord are used to detect ( find ) childhood CNS embryonal tumors or pineoblastomas    .
- A biopsy may be done to be sure of the diagnosis of CNS embryonal tumor or pineoblastoma    .
- Certain factors affect prognosis ( chance of recovery ) and treatment options    .
Central nervous system ( CNS ) embryonal tumors may begin in embryonic ( fetal ) cells that remain in the brain after birth    .
Central nervous system ( CNS ) embryonal tumors form in embryonic cells that remain in the brain after birth    .
CNS embryonal tumors tend to spread through the cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) to other parts of the brain and spinal cord    .
The tumors may be malignant ( cancer ) or benign ( not cancer )    .
Most CNS embryonal tumors in children are malignant    .
Malignant brain tumors are likely to grow quickly and spread into other parts of the brain    .
When a tumor grows into or presses on an area of the brain , it may stop that part of the brain from working the way it should    .
Benign brain tumors grow and press on nearby areas of the brain    .
They rarely spread to other parts of the brain    .
Both benign and malignant brain tumors can cause signs or symptoms and need treatment    .
Although cancer is rare in children , brain tumors are the third most common type of childhood cancer , after leukemia and lymphoma    .
This summary is about the treatment of primary brain tumors ( tumors that begin in the brain )    .
The treatment of metastatic brain tumors , which begin in other parts of the body and spread to the brain , is not discussed in this summary    .
For information about the different types of brain and spinal cord tumors , see the PDQ summary on Childhood Brain and Spinal Cord Tumors Treatment Overview    .
Brain tumors occur in both children and adults    .
Treatment for adults may be different from treatment for children    .
See the PDQ summary on Adult Central Nervous System Tumors Treatment for more information on the treatment of adults    .
There are different types of CNS embryonal tumors    .
The different types of CNS embryonal tumors include : - Medulloblastomas
Most CNS embryonal tumors are medulloblastomas    .
Medulloblastomas are fast - growing tumors that form in brain cells in the cerebellum    .
The cerebellum is at the lower back part of the brain between the cerebrum and the brain stem    .
The cerebellum controls movement , balance , and posture    .
Medulloblastomas sometimes spread to the bone , bone marrow , lung , or other parts of the body , but this is rare    .
- Nonmedulloblastoma embryonal tumors Nonmedulloblastoma embryonal tumors are fast - growing tumors that usually form in brain cells in the cerebrum    .
The cerebrum is at the top of the head and is the largest part of the brain    .
The cerebrum controls thinking , learning , problem - solving , emotions , speech , reading , writing , and voluntary movement    .
Nonmedulloblastoma embryonal tumors may also form in the brain stem or spinal cord    .
There are four types of nonmedulloblastoma embryonal tumors : - Embryonal tumors with multilayered rosettes Embryonal tumors with multilayered rosettes ( ETMR ) are rare tumors that form in the brain and spinal cord    .
ETMR most commonly occur in young children and are fast - growing tumors    .
- Medulloepitheliomas Medulloepitheliomas are fast - growing tumors that usually form in the brain , spinal cord or nerves just outside the spinal column    .
They occur most often in infants and young children    .
- CNS neuroblastomas CNS neuroblastomas are a very rare type of neuroblastoma that form in the nerve tissue of the cerebrum or the layers of tissue that cover the brain and spinal cord    .
CNS neuroblastomas may be large and spread to other parts of the brain or spinal cord    .
- CNS ganglioneuroblastomas CNS ganglioneuroblastomas are rare tumors that form in nerve tissue of the brain and spinal cord    .
They may form in one area and be fast growing or form in more than one area and be slow growing    .
Childhood CNS atypical teratoid / rhabdoid tumor is also a type of embryonal tumor , but it is treated differently than other childhood CNS embryonal tumors    .
See the PDQ summary on Childhood Central Nervous System Atypical Teratoid / Rhabdoid Tumor Treatment for more information    .
Pineoblastomas form in cells of the pineal gland    .
The pineal gland is a tiny organ in the center of the brain    .
The gland makes melatonin , a substance that helps control our sleep cycle    .
Pineoblastomas form in cells of the pineal gland and are usually malignant    .
Pineoblastomas are fast - growing tumors with cells that look very different from normal pineal gland cells    .
Pineoblastomas are not a type of CNS embryonal tumor but treatment for them is a lot like treatment for CNS embryonal tumors    .
Pineoblastoma is linked with inherited changes in the retinoblastoma ( RB1 ) gene    .
A child with the inherited form of retinoblastoma ( cancer than forms in the tissues of the retina ) has an increased risk of pineoblastoma    .
When retinoblastoma forms at the same time as a tumor in or near the pineal gland , it is called trilateral retinoblastoma    .
MRI ( magnetic resonance imaging ) testing in children with retinoblastoma may detect pineoblastoma at an early stage when it can be treated successfully    .
Who is at risk for Childhood Central Nervous System Embryonal Tumors? ?

Certain genetic conditions increase the risk of childhood CNS embryonal tumors    .
Anything that increases the risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor    .
Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer ; not having risk factors doesnt mean that you will not get cancer    .
Talk with your childs doctor if you think your child may be at risk    .
Risk factors for CNS embryonal tumors include having the following inherited diseases : - Turcot syndrome    .
- Rubinstein - Taybi syndrome    .    - Nevoid basal cell carcinoma ( Gorlin ) syndrome    .
- Li-Fraumeni syndrome    .    - Fanconi anemia    .
In most cases , the cause of CNS embryonal tumors is not known    .
What are the symptoms of Childhood Central Nervous System Embryonal Tumors ?

Signs and symptoms of childhood CNS embryonal tumors or pineoblastomas depend on the child 's age and where the tumor is    .
These and other signs and symptoms may be caused by childhood CNS embryonal tumors , pineoblastomas , or other conditions    .
Check with your child 's doctor if your child has any of the following : - Loss of balance , trouble walking , worsening handwriting , or slow speech    .
- Lack of coordination    .
- Headache , especially in the morning , or headache that goes away after vomiting    .
- Double vision or other eye problems    .
- Nausea and vomiting    .
- General weakness or weakness on one side of the face    .
- Unusual sleepiness or change in energy level    .
- Seizures    .
Infants and young children with these tumors may be irritable or grow slowly    .
Also they may not eat well or meet developmental milestones such as sitting , walking , and talking in sentences    .
How to diagnose Childhood Central Nervous System Embryonal Tumors ?

Tests that examine the brain and spinal cord are used to detect ( find ) childhood CNS embryonal tumors or pineoblastomas    .
The following tests and procedures may be used : - Physical exam and history :
An exam of the body to check general signs of health , including checking for signs of disease , such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual    .
A history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken    .
- Neurological exam :
A series of questions and tests to check the brain , spinal cord , and nerve function    .
The exam checks a patient 's mental status , coordination , and ability to walk normally , and how well the muscles , senses , and reflexes work    .
This may also be called a neuro exam or a neurologic exam    .
- MRI ( magnetic resonance imaging ) of the brain and spinal cord with gadolinium :
A procedure that uses a magnet , radio waves , and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the brain and spinal cord    .
A substance called gadolinium is injected into a vein    .
The gadolinium collects around the cancer cells so they show up brighter in the picture    .
This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging ( NMRI )    .
Sometimes magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( MRS ) is done during the MRI scan to look at the chemicals in brain tissue    .
- Lumbar puncture : A procedure used to collect cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) from the spinal column    .
This is done by placing a needle between two bones in the spine and into the CSF around the spinal cord and removing a sample of the fluid    .
The sample of CSF is checked under a microscope for signs of tumor cells    .
The sample may also be checked for the amounts of protein and glucose    .
A higher than normal amount of protein or lower than normal amount of glucose may be a sign of a tumor    .
This procedure is also called an LP or spinal tap    .
A biopsy may be done to be sure of the diagnosis of CNS embryonal tumor or pineoblastoma    .
If doctors think your child may have a CNS embryonal tumor or pineoblastoma , a biopsy may be done    .
For brain tumors , the biopsy is done by removing part of the skull and using a needle to remove a sample of tissue    .
Sometimes , a computer - guided needle is used to remove the tissue sample    .
A pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells    .
If cancer cells are found , the doctor may remove as much tumor as safely possible during the same surgery    .
The piece of skull is usually put back in place after the procedure    .
The following test may be done on the sample of tissue that is removed : - Immunohistochemistry :
A test that uses antibodies to check for certain antigens in a sample of tissue    .
The antibody is usually linked to a radioactive substance or a dye that causes the tissue to light up under a microscope    .
This type of test may be used to tell the difference between different types of brain tumors    .
What is the outlook for Childhood Central Nervous System Embryonal Tumors ?

Certain factors affect prognosis ( chance of recovery ) and treatment options    .
The prognosis ( chance of recovery ) and treatment options depend on : - The type of tumor and where it is in the brain    .
- Whether the cancer has spread within the brain and spinal cord when the tumor is found    .
- The age of the child when the tumor is found    .
- How much of the tumor remains after surgery    .
- Whether there are certain changes in the chromosomes , genes , or brain cells    .
- Whether the tumor has just been diagnosed or has recurred ( come back )    .
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Childhood Central Nervous System Embryonal Tumors ?

New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials    .
Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website    .
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
For some patients , taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice    .
Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process    .
Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment    .
Many of today 's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials    .
Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment    .
Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future    .
Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments , they often answer important questions and help move research forward    .
Patients can enter clinical trials before , during , or after starting their cancer treatment    .
Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment    .
Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better    .
There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring ( coming back ) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment    .
Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country    .
See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials    .
These have been retrieved from NCI 's listing of clinical trials    .
What are the treatments for Childhood Central Nervous System Embryonal Tumors ?

Key Points
- There are different types of treatment for children who have central nervous system ( CNS ) embryonal tumors    .
- Children who have CNS embryonal tumors should have their treatment planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating brain tumors in children    .
- Childhood brain tumors may cause signs or symptoms that begin before the cancer is diagnosed and continue for months or years    .
- Some cancer treatments cause side effects months or years after treatment has ended    .
- Five types of treatment are used : - Surgery - Radiation therapy - Chemotherapy - High - dose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue - Targeted therapy - New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials    .
- Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .

- Follow - up tests may be needed    .
There are different types of treatment for children who have central nervous system ( CNS ) embryonal tumors    .
Different types of treatment are available for children with central nervous system ( CNS ) embryonal tumors    .
Some treatments are standard ( the currently used treatment ) , and some are being tested in clinical trials    .
A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer    .
When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment , the new treatment may become the standard treatment    .
Because cancer in children is rare , taking part in a clinical trial should be considered    .
Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment    .
Children who have CNS embryonal tumors should have their treatment planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating brain tumors in children    .
Treatment will be overseen by a pediatric oncologist , a doctor who specializes in treating children with cancer    .
The pediatric oncologist works with other pediatric health care providers who are experts in treating children with brain tumors and who specialize in certain areas of medicine    .
These may include the following specialists : - Pediatrician    .    - Neurosurgeon    .    - Neurologist    .    - Neuropathologist    .
- Neuroradiologist    .
- Rehabilitation specialist    .
- Radiation oncologist    .    - Psychologist    .
Childhood brain tumors may cause signs or symptoms that begin before the cancer is diagnosed and continue for months or years    .
Signs or symptoms caused by the tumor may begin before the cancer is diagnosed and continue for months or years    .
It is important to talk with your child 's doctors about signs or symptoms caused by the tumor that may continue after treatment    .
Some cancer treatments cause side effects months or years after treatment has ended    .
Side effects from cancer treatment that begin during or after treatment and continue for months or years are called late effects    .
Late effects of cancer treatment may include the following : - Physical problems    .
- Changes in mood , feelings , thinking , learning , or memory    .
- Second cancers ( new types of cancer )    .
Children diagnosed with medulloblastoma may have certain problems after surgery or radiation therapy such as changes in the ability to think , learn , and pay attention    .
Also , cerebellar mutism syndrome may occur after surgery    .
Signs of this syndrome include the following : - Delayed ability to speak    .
- Trouble swallowing and eating    .
- Loss of balance , trouble walking , and worsening handwriting    .
- Loss of muscle tone    .
- Mood swings and changes in personality    .
Some late effects may be treated or controlled    .
It is important to talk with your child 's doctors about the effects cancer treatment can have on your child    .
( See the PDQ summary on Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer for more information )    .
Five types of treatment are used :
Surgery Surgery is used to diagnose and treat a childhood CNS embryonal tumor as described in the General Information section of this summary    .
Even if the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery , some patients may be given chemotherapy and / or radiation therapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left    .
Treatment given after the surgery , to lower the risk that the cancer will come back , is called adjuvant therapy    .
Radiation therapy Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high - energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing    .
There are two types of radiation therapy : - External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer    .
Certain ways of giving radiation therapy can help keep radiation from damaging nearby healthy tissue    .
These types of radiation therapy include the following : - Conformal radiation therapy : Conformal radiation therapy is a type of external radiation therapy that uses a computer to make a 3 - dimensional ( 3 - D ) picture of the tumor and shapes the radiation beams to fit the tumor    .
This allows a high dose of radiation to reach the tumor and causes less damage to nearby healthy tissue    .
- Stereotactic radiation therapy : Stereotactic radiation therapy is a type of external radiation therapy    .
A rigid head frame is attached to the skull to keep the head still during the radiation treatment    .
A machine aims radiation directly at the tumor , causing less damage to nearby healthy tissue    .
The total dose of radiation is divided into several smaller doses given over several days    .
This procedure is also called stereotactic external - beam radiation therapy and stereotaxic radiation therapy    .
- Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles , seeds , wires , or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer    .
Radiation therapy to the brain can affect growth and development in young children    .
For this reason , clinical trials are studying new ways of giving radiation that may have fewer side effects than standard methods    .
The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type of cancer being treated    .
External radiation therapy is used to treat childhood CNS embryonal tumors    .
Because radiation therapy can affect growth and brain development in young children , especially children who are three years old or younger , chemotherapy may be given to delay or reduce the need for radiation therapy    .
Chemotherapy Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells , either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing    .
When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle , the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body ( systemic chemotherapy )    .
When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid , an organ , or a body cavity such as the abdomen , the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas ( regional chemotherapy )    .
Combination chemotherapy is treatment using more than one anticancer drug    .
The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type of cancer being treated    .
Regular dose anticancer drugs given by mouth or vein to treat central nervous system tumors cannot cross the blood - brain barrier and enter the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord    .
Instead , an anticancer drug is injected into the fluid - filled space to kill cancer cells that may have spread there    .
This is called intrathecal or intraventricular chemotherapy    .
High - dose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue High - dose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue is a way of giving high doses of chemotherapy and replacing blood - forming cells destroyed by the cancer treatment    .
Stem cells ( immature blood cells ) are removed from the blood or bone marrow of the patient or a donor and are frozen and stored    .
After the chemotherapy is completed , the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion    .
These reinfused stem cells grow into ( and restore ) the bodys blood cells    .
Targeted therapy Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to attack cancer cells    .
Targeted therapies usually cause less harm to normal cells than chemotherapy or radiation therapy do    .
Signal transduction inhibitors are a type of targeted therapy used to treat recurrent medulloblastoma    .
Signal transduction inhibitors block signals that are passed from one molecule to another inside a cell    .
Blocking these signals may kill cancer cells    .
Vismodegib is a type of signal transduction inhibitor    .
New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials    .
Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website    .
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
For some patients , taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice    .

Patients can enter clinical trials before , during , or after starting their cancer treatment    .
Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment    .
Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better    .
There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring ( coming back ) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment    .
Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country    .
See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials    .
These have been retrieved from NCI 's listing of clinical trials    .
Follow - up tests may be needed    .
Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated    .
( See the General Information section for a list of tests    .    )
Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working    .
Decisions about whether to continue , change , or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests    .
This is sometimes called re-staging    .
Some of the imaging tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended    .
The results of these tests can show if your child 's condition has changed or if the brain tumor has recurred ( come back )    .
If the imaging tests show abnormal tissue in the brain , a biopsy may also be done to find out if the tissue is made up of dead tumor cells or if new cancer cells are growing    .
These tests are sometimes called follow - up tests or check - ups    .

Childhood central nervous system ( CNS ) germ cell tumors form from germ cells    .
Germ cells are a type of cell that form as a fetus ( unborn baby ) develops    .
These cells later become sperm in the testicles or eggs in the ovaries    .
Sometimes while the fetus is forming , germ cells travel to other parts of the body and grow into germ cell tumors    .
Germ cells tumors that form in the brain or spinal cord are called CNS germ cell tumors    .
The most common places for one or more central nervous system ( CNS ) germ cell tumors to form is near the pineal gland and in an area of the brain that includes the pituitary gland and the tissue just above it    .
Sometimes germ cell tumors may form in other areas of the brain    .
This summary is about germ cell tumors that start in the central nervous system ( brain and spinal cord )    .
Germ cell tumors may also form in other parts of the body    .
See the PDQ summary on Childhood Extracranial Germ Cell Tumors Treatment for information on germ cell tumors that are extracranial ( outside the brain )    .
CNS germ cell tumors usually occur in children , but may occur in adults    .
Treatment for children may be different than treatment for adults    .
See the following PDQ summaries for information about treatment for adults : - Adult Central Nervous System Tumors Treatment - Extragonadal Germ Cell Tumors Treatment
For information about other types of childhood brain and spinal cord tumors , see the PDQ summary on Childhood Brain and Spinal Cord Tumors Treatment Overview    .

This summary is about the treatment of the following types of CNS germ cell tumors : Germinomas Germinomas are the most common type of CNS germ cell tumor and have a good prognosis    .
Nongerminomas
Some nongerminomas make hormones    .
CNS teratomas are a type of nongerminoma that does not make hormones    .
They may have different kinds of tissue in them , such as hair , muscle , and bone    .
Teratomas are described as mature or immature , based on how normal the cells look under a microscope    .
Sometimes teratomas are a mix of mature and immature cells    .
Other types of nongerminomas include the following : - Choriocarcinomas make the hormone beta - human chorionic gonadotropin ( - hCG )    .
- Embryonal carcinomas do not make hormones    .

How to diagnose Childhood Central Nervous System Germ Cell Tumors ?

Imaging studies and tests are used to detect ( find ) and diagnose childhood CNS germ cell tumors    .
The following tests and procedures may be used : - Physical exam and history :
-शारीरिक परीक्षण और इतिहास :
An exam of the body to check general signs of health , including checking for signs of disease , such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual    .
A history of the patient 's health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken    .
- Neurological exam :
A series of questions and tests to check the brain , spinal cord , and nerve function    .
The exam checks a persons mental status , coordination , and ability to walk normally , and how well the muscles , senses , and reflexes work    .
This may also be called a neuro exam or a neurologic exam    .
- Visual field exam :
An exam to check a persons field of vision ( the total area in which objects can be seen )    .
This test measures both central vision ( how much a person can see when looking straight ahead ) and peripheral vision ( how much a person can see in all other directions while staring straight ahead )    .
The eyes are tested one at a time    .
The eye not being tested is covered    .
- MRI ( magnetic resonance imaging ) with gadolinium :
A procedure that uses a magnet , radio waves , and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the brain and spinal cord    .
A substance called gadolinium is injected into a vein    .
The gadolinium collects around the cancer cells so they show up brighter in the picture    .
This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging ( NMRI )    .
- Lumbar puncture : A procedure used to collect cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) from the spinal column    .
This is done by placing a needle between two bones in the spine and into the CSF around the spinal cord and removing a sample of the fluid    .
The sample of CSF is checked under a microscope for signs of tumor cells    .
The sample may also be checked for the amounts of protein and glucose    .
A higher than normal amount of protein or lower than normal amount of glucose may be a sign of a tumor    .
This procedure is also called an LP or spinal tap    .
- Tumor marker tests :
A procedure in which a sample of blood or cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood and CSF by organs , tissues , or tumor cells in the body    .
Certain substances are linked to specific types of cancer when found in increased levels in the blood    .
These are called tumor markers    .
The following tumor markers are used to diagnose some CNS germ cell tumors : - Alpha-fetoprotein ( AFP )    .
- Beta -human chorionic gonadotropin ( - hCG )    .    - Blood chemistry studies :
A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body    .
An unusual ( higher - or lower - than - normal ) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease    .
- Blood hormone studies : A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain hormones released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body    .
An unusual ( higher - or lower - than - normal ) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease in the organ or tissue that makes it    .
The blood will be checked for the levels of hormones made by the pituitary gland and other glands    .
A biopsy may be done to be sure of the diagnosis of CNS germ cell tumor    .
If doctors think your child may have a CNS germ cell tumor , a biopsy may be done    .
For brain tumors , the biopsy is done by removing part of the skull and using a needle to remove a sample of tissue    .
Sometimes , a needle guided by a computer is used to remove the tissue sample    .
A pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells    .
If cancer cells are found , the doctor may remove as much tumor as safely possible during the same surgery    .
The piece of skull is usually put back in place after the procedure    .
Sometimes the diagnosis can be made based on the results of imaging and tumor marker tests and a biopsy is not needed    .
The following test may be done on the sample of tissue that is removed : - Immunohistochemistry :
A test that uses antibodies to check for certain antigens in a sample of tissue    .
The antibody is usually linked to a radioactive substance or a dye that causes the tissue to light up under a microscope    .
This type of test may be used to tell the difference between different types of brain tumors    .
What is the outlook for Childhood Central Nervous System Germ Cell Tumors ?

Certain factors affect prognosis ( chance of recovery )    .
The prognosis ( chance of recovery ) depends on the following : - The type of germ cell tumor    .
- The type and level of any tumor markers    .
- Where the tumor is in the brain or in the spinal cord    .
- Whether the cancer has spread within the brain and spinal cord or to other parts of the body    .
- Whether the tumor is newly diagnosed or has recurred ( come back ) after treatment    .
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Childhood Central Nervous System Germ Cell Tumors ?

Check the list of NCI - supported cancer clinical trials that are now accepting patients with childhood central nervous system germ cell tumor    .

Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website    .
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
For some patients , taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice    .
Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process    .
Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment    .
Many of today 's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials    .
Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment    .
Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future    .
Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments , they often answer important questions and help move research forward    .
Patients can enter clinical trials before , during , or after starting their cancer treatment    .
Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment    .
Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better    .
There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring ( coming back ) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment    .
Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country    .
See the Current Clinical Trials section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials    .

There are different types of treatment for patients with childhood central nervous system ( CNS ) germ cell tumors    .
Different types of treatment are available for children with childhood central nervous system ( CNS ) germ cell tumors    .
Some treatments are standard ( the currently used treatment ) , and some are being tested in clinical trials    .
A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer    .
When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment , the new treatment may become the standard treatment    .
Because cancer in children is rare , taking part in a clinical trial should be considered    .
Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment    .
Children with childhood CNS germ cell tumors should have their treatment planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating cancer in children    .
Treatment will be overseen by a pediatric oncologist and / or a radiation oncologist ,    .
A pediatric oncologist is a doctor who specializes in treating children with cancer    .
A radiation oncologist specializes in treating cancer with radiation therapy    .
These doctors work with other pediatric health care providers who are experts in treating children with childhood CNS germ cell tumors and who specialize in certain areas of medicine    .
These may include the following specialists : - Pediatrician    .    - Pediatric neurosurgeon    .    - Neurologist    .    - Endocrinologist    .    - Ophthalmologist    .
- Pediatric nurse specialist    .
- Rehabilitation specialist    .
- Psychologist    .    - Social worker    .
Childhood CNS germ cell tumors may cause signs or symptoms that begin before the cancer is diagnosed and continue for months or years    .
Childhood CNS germ cell tumors may cause signs or symptoms that continue for months or years    .
Signs or symptoms caused by the tumor may begin before the cancer is diagnosed    .
Signs or symptoms caused by treatment may begin during or right after treatment    .
Some cancer treatments cause side effects months or years after treatment has ended    .
Some cancer treatments cause side effects that continue or appear months or years after cancer treatment has ended    .
These are called late effects    .
Late effects of cancer treatment may include : - Physical problems    .
- Changes in mood , feelings , thinking , learning , or memory    .
- Second cancers ( new types of cancer )    .
Some late effects may be treated or controlled    .
It is important to talk with your child 's doctors about the possible late effects caused by some treatments    .
( See the PDQ summary on Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer for more information )    .
Four types of treatment are used :
Radiation therapy Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high - energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing    .
There are two types of radiation therapy : - External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer    .
Certain ways of giving radiation therapy can help keep radiation from damaging nearby healthy tissue    .
This type of radiation therapy may include the following : - Stereotactic radiosurgery : Stereotactic radiosurgery is a type of external radiation therapy    .
A rigid head frame is attached to the skull to keep the head still during the radiation treatment    .
A machine aims a single large dose of radiation directly at the tumor    .
This procedure does not involve surgery    .
It is also called stereotaxic radiosurgery , radiosurgery , and radiation surgery    .
- Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles , seeds , wires , or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer    .
The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type of cancer being treated    .
External radiation therapy is used to treat childhood CNS germ cell tumors    .
Radiation therapy to the brain can affect growth and development in young children    .
Certain ways of giving radiation therapy can lessen the damage to healthy brain tissue    .
For children younger than 3 years , chemotherapy may be given instead    .
This can delay or reduce the need for radiation therapy    .
Chemotherapy Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells , either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing    .
When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle , the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body ( systemic chemotherapy )    .
When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid , an organ , or a body cavity such as the abdomen , the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas ( regional chemotherapy )    .
The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type of cancer being treated    .
Surgery
Whether surgery to remove the tumor can be done depends on where the tumor is in the brain    .
Surgery to remove the tumor may cause severe , long - term side effects    .
Surgery may be done to remove teratomas and may be used for germ cell tumors that come back    .
Even if the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery , some patients may be given chemotherapy or radiation therapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left    .
Treatment given after the surgery , to lower the risk that the cancer will come back , is called adjuvant therapy    .
High - dose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue High - dose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue is a way of giving high doses of chemotherapy and replacing blood - forming cells destroyed by the cancer treatment    .
Stem cells ( immature blood cells ) are removed from the blood or bone marrow of the patient or a donor and are frozen and stored    .
After the chemotherapy is completed , the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion    .
These reinfused stem cells grow into ( and restore ) the bodys blood cells    .
New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials    .
Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website    .
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
For some patients , taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice    .
Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process    .
Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment    .
Many of today 's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials    .
Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment    .
Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future    .
Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments , they often answer important questions and help move research forward    .
Patients can enter clinical trials before , during , or after starting their cancer treatment    .
Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment    .
Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better    .
There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring ( coming back ) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment    .
Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country    .
See the Current Clinical Trials section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials    .
These have been retrieved from the NCI 's listing of clinical trials    .
Follow - up tests may be needed    .
Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated    .
Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working    .
Decisions about whether to continue , change , or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests    .
Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended    .
The results of these tests can show if your child 's condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred ( come back )    .
These tests are sometimes called follow - up tests or check - ups    .
Children whose cancer affected their pituitary gland when the cancer was diagnosed will usually need to have their blood hormone levels checked    .
If the blood hormone level is low , replacement hormone medicine is given    .
Children who had a high tumor marker level ( alpha - fetoprotein or beta - human chorionic gonadotropin ) when the cancer was diagnosed usually need to have their blood tumor marker level checked    .
If the tumor marker level increases after initial treatment , the tumor may have recurred    .
Treatment Options for Childhood CNS Germ Cell Tumors
Newly Diagnosed CNS Germinomas
Treatment of newly diagnosed central nervous system ( CNS ) germinomas may include the following : - Radiation therapy to the tumor and ventricles ( fluid - filled spaces ) of the brain    .
A higher dose of radiation is given to the tumor than the area around the tumor    .
- Chemotherapy followed by radiation therapy , for younger children    .    - A clinical trial of chemotherapy followed by radiation therapy given in lower doses depending on how the tumor responds to treatment    .
Newly Diagnosed CNS Teratomas
Treatment of newly diagnosed mature and immature central nervous system ( CNS ) teratomas may include the following : - Surgery to remove as much of the tumor as possible    .
Radiation therapy and / or chemotherapy may be given if any tumor remains after surgery    .
Newly Diagnosed CNS Nongerminomas
It is not clear what treatment is best for newly diagnosed central nervous system ( CNS ) nongerminomas is    .
Treatment of choriocarcinoma , embryonal carcinoma , yolk sac tumor , or mixed germ cell tumor may include the following : - Chemotherapy followed by radiation therapy    .
If a mass remains after chemotherapy , surgery may be needed to check if the mass is a mature teratoma , fibrosis , or a growing tumor    .
- If the mass is a mature teratoma or fibrosis , radiation therapy is given    .
- If the mass is a growing tumor , other treatments may be given    .
- Surgery to remove as much of the mass as possible and check for tumor cells , if tumor marker levels are normal and the mass continues to grow ( called growing teratoma syndrome )    .    - A clinical trial of chemotherapy followed by radiation therapy given in lower doses depending on how the tumor responds to treatment    .
Recurrent Childhood CNS Germ Cell Tumors
Treatment of recurrent childhood central nervous system ( CNS ) germ cell tumors may include the following : - Chemotherapy followed by radiation therapy    .
- High - dose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue using the patient 's stem cells    .

What is (are) Childhood Craniopharyngioma ?

Key Points
- Childhood craniopharyngiomas are benign brain tumors found near the pituitary gland    .
- There are no known risk factors for childhood craniopharyngioma    .
- Signs of childhood craniopharyngioma include vision changes and slow growth    .
- Tests that examine the brain , vision , and hormone levels are used to detect ( find ) childhood craniopharyngiomas    .
- Childhood craniopharyngiomas are diagnosed and may be removed in the same surgery    .
- Certain factors affect prognosis ( chance of recovery ) and treatment options    .
Childhood craniopharyngiomas are benign brain tumors found near the pituitary gland    .
Childhood craniopharyngiomas are rare tumors usually found near the pituitary gland ( a pea-sized organ at the bottom of the brain that controls other glands ) and the hypothalamus ( a small cone - shaped organ connected to the pituitary gland by nerves )    .
Craniopharyngiomas are usually part solid mass and part fluid - filled cyst    .
They are benign ( not cancer ) and do not spread to other parts of the brain or to other parts of the body    .
However , they may grow and press on nearby parts of the brain or other areas , including the pituitary gland , the optic chiasm , optic nerves , and fluid - filled spaces in the brain    .
Craniopharyngiomas may affect many functions of the brain    .
They may affect hormone making , growth , and vision    .
Benign brain tumors need treatment    .
This summary is about the treatment of primary brain tumors ( tumors that begin in the brain )    .
Treatment for metastatic brain tumors , which are tumors formed by cancer cells that begin in other parts of the body and spread to the brain , is not covered in this summary    .
See the PDQ treatment summary on Childhood Brain and Spinal Cord Tumors Treatment Overview for information about the different types of childhood brain and spinal cord tumors    .
Brain tumors can occur in both children and adults ; however , treatment for children may be different than treatment for adults    .
( See the PDQ summary on Adult Central Nervous System Tumors Treatment for more information    .    )
Who is at risk for Childhood Craniopharyngioma? ?

There are no known risk factors for childhood craniopharyngioma    .
Craniopharyngiomas are rare in children younger than 2 years of age and are most often diagnosed in children aged 5 to 14 years    .
It is not known what causes these tumors    .
What are the symptoms of Childhood Craniopharyngioma ?

Signs of childhood craniopharyngioma include vision changes and slow growth    .
These and other signs and symptoms may be caused by craniopharyngiomas or by other conditions    .
Check with your childs doctor if your child has any of the following : - Headaches , including morning headache or headache that goes away after vomiting    .
- Vision changes    .
- Nausea and vomiting    .
- Loss of balance or trouble walking    .
- Increase in thirst or urination    .
- Unusual sleepiness or change in energy level    .
- Changes in personality or behavior    .
- Short stature or slow growth    .
- Hearing loss    .    - Weight gain    .
How to diagnose Childhood Craniopharyngioma ?

Tests that examine the brain , vision , and hormone levels are used to detect ( find ) childhood craniopharyngiomas    .
The following tests and procedures may be used : - Physical exam and history :
-शारीरिक परीक्षण और इतिहास :
An exam of the body to check general signs of health , including checking for signs of disease , such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual    .
A history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken    .
- Neurological exam :
A series of questions and tests to check the brain , spinal cord , and nerve function    .
The exam checks a persons mental status , coordination , and ability to walk normally , and how well the muscles , senses , and reflexes work    .
This may also be called a neuro exam or a neurologic exam    .
- Visual field exam :
An exam to check a persons field of vision ( the total area in which objects can be seen )    .
This test measures both central vision ( how much a person can see when looking straight ahead ) and peripheral vision ( how much a person can see in all other directions while staring straight ahead )    .
Any loss of vision may be a sign of a tumor that has damaged or pressed on the parts of the brain that affect eyesight    .
- CT scan ( CAT scan ) : A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body , taken from different angles    .
The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine    .
A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly    .
This procedure is also called computed tomography , computerized tomography , or computerized axial tomography    .
- MRI ( magnetic resonance imaging ) of the brain and spinal cord with gadolinium :
A procedure that uses a magnet , radio waves , and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the brain    .
A substance called gadolinium is injected into a vein    .
The gadolinium collects around the tumor cells so they show up brighter in the picture    .
This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging ( NMRI )    .
- Blood chemistry studies :
A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body    .
An unusual ( higher or lower than normal ) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease    .
- Blood hormone studies : A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain hormones released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body    .
An unusual ( higher or lower than normal ) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease in the organ or tissue that makes it    .
For example , the blood may be checked for unusual levels of thyroid - stimulating hormone ( TSH ) or adrenocorticotropic hormone ( ACTH )    .
TSH and ACTH are made by the pituitary gland in the brain    .
Childhood craniopharyngiomas are diagnosed and may be removed in the same surgery    .
Doctors may think a mass is a craniopharyngioma based on where it is in the brain and how it looks on a CT scan or MRI    .
In order to be sure , a sample of tissue is needed    .
One of the following types of biopsy procedures may be used to take the sample of tissue : - Open biopsy : A hollow needle is inserted through a hole in the skull into the brain    .
- Computer - guided needle biopsy : A hollow needle guided by a computer is inserted through a small hole in the skull into the brain    .
- Transsphenoidal biopsy : Instruments are inserted through the nose and sphenoid bone ( a butterfly - shaped bone at the base of the skull ) and into the brain    .
A pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to look for tumor cells    .
If tumor cells are found , as much tumor as safely possible may be removed during the same surgery    .
The following laboratory test may be done on the sample of tissue that is removed : - Immunohistochemistry :
A test that uses antibodies to check for certain antigens in a sample of tissue    .
The antibody is usually linked to a radioactive substance or a dye that causes the tissue to light up under a microscope    .
This type of test may be used to tell the difference between different types of cancer    .
What is the outlook for Childhood Craniopharyngioma ?

Certain factors affect prognosis ( chance of recovery ) and treatment options    .
The prognosis ( chance of recovery ) and treatment options depend on the following : - The size of the tumor    .    - Where the tumor is in the brain    .
- Whether there are tumor cells left after surgery    .
- The child 's age    .
- Side effects that may occur months or years after treatment    .
- Whether the tumor has just been diagnosed or has recurred ( come back )    .
What are the stages of Childhood Craniopharyngioma ?

The process used to find out if cancer has spread within the brain or to other parts of the body is called staging    .
There is no standard system for staging childhood craniopharyngioma    .
Craniopharyngioma is described as newly diagnosed disease or recurrent disease    .
The results of the tests and procedures done to diagnose craniopharyngioma are used to help make decisions about treatment    .

Childhood brain tumors may cause signs or symptoms that begin before the cancer is diagnosed and continue for months or years    .
Signs or symptoms caused by the tumor may begin before diagnosis and continue for months or years    .
It is important to talk with your child 's doctors about signs or symptoms caused by the tumor that may continue after treatment    .
Some treatments for tumors cause side effects months or years after treatment has ended    .
Side effects from tumor treatment that begin during or after treatment and continue for months or years are called late effects    .
Late effects of tumor treatment may include the following : - Physical problems such as seizures    .
- Behavior problems    .    - Changes in mood , feelings , thinking , learning , or memory    .
- Second cancers ( new types of cancer )    .
The following serious physical problems may occur if the pituitary gland , hypothalamus , optic nerves , or carotid artery are affected during surgery or radiation therapy : - Obesity    .
- Metabolic syndrome , including fatty liver disease not caused by drinking alcohol    .
- Vision problems , including blindness    .
- Blood vessel problems or stroke    .
- Loss of the ability to make certain hormones    .
Some late effects may be treated or controlled    .
Life - long hormone replacement therapy with several medicines may be needed    .
It is important to talk with your child 's doctors about the effects tumor treatment can have on your child    .
( See the PDQ summary on Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer for more information )    .
Five types of treatment are used :
Surgery ( resection )
The way the surgery is done depends on the size of the tumor and where it is in the brain    .
It also depends on whether the tumor has grown into nearby tissue in a finger - like way and expected late effects after surgery    .
The types of surgery that may be used to remove all of the tumor that can be seen with the eye include the following : - Transsphenoidal surgery : A type of surgery in which the instruments are inserted into part of the brain by going through an incision ( cut ) made under the upper lip or at the bottom of the nose between the nostrils and then through the sphenoid bone ( a butterfly - shaped bone at the base of the skull )    .
- Craniotomy : Surgery to remove the tumor through an opening made in the skull    .
Sometimes all of the tumor that can be seen is removed in surgery and no further treatment is needed    .
At other times , it is hard to remove the tumor because it is growing into or pressing on nearby organs    .
If there is tumor remaining after the surgery , radiation therapy is usually given to kill any tumor cells that are left    .
Treatment given after the surgery , to lower the risk that the cancer will come back , is called adjuvant therapy    .
Surgery and radiation therapy Partial resection is used to treat some craniopharyngiomas    .
It is used to diagnose the tumor , remove fluid from a cyst , and relieve pressure on the optic nerves    .
If the tumor is near the pituitary gland or hypothalamus , it is not removed    .
This reduces the number of serious side effects after surgery    .
Partial resection is followed by radiation therapy    .
Radiation therapy is a tumor treatment that uses high - energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill tumor cells or keep them from growing    .
There are two types of radiation therapy : - External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the tumor    .
- एक्सटरनल रेडिएशन थेरेपी में कैंसर की ओर विकिरण भेजने के लिए शरीर के बाहर एक मशीन का उपयोग किया जाता है।
- Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles , seeds , wires , or catheters that are placed directly into or near the tumor    .
The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type of tumor , whether the tumor is newly diagnosed or has come back , and where the tumor formed in the brain    .
External and internal radiation therapy are used to treat childhood craniopharyngioma    .
Because radiation therapy to the brain can affect growth and development in young children , ways of giving radiation therapy that have fewer side effects are being used    .
These include : - Stereotactic radiosurgery :
For very small craniopharyngiomas at the base of the brain , stereotactic radiosurgery may be used    .
Stereotactic radiosurgery is a type of external radiation therapy    .
A rigid head frame is attached to the skull to keep the head still during the radiation treatment    .
A machine aims a single large dose of radiation directly at the tumor    .
This procedure does not involve surgery    .
It is also called stereotaxic radiosurgery , radiosurgery , and radiation surgery    .
- Intracavitary radiation therapy : Intracavitary radiation therapy is a type of internal radiation therapy that may be used in tumors that are part solid mass and part fluid - filled cyst    .
Radioactive material is placed inside the tumor    .
This type of radiation therapy causes less damage to the nearby hypothalamus and optic nerves    .
- Intensity - modulated proton therapy : A type of radiation therapy that uses streams of protons ( tiny particles with a positive charge ) to kill tumor cells    .
A computer is used to target the exact shape and location of the tumor with proton therapy    .
This type of 3 - dimensional radiation therapy may cause less damage to healthy tissue in the brain and other parts of the body    .
Proton radiation is different from x-ray radiation    .
Surgery with cyst drainage Surgery may be done to drain tumors that are mostly fluid - filled cysts    .
This lowers pressure in the brain and relieves symptoms    .
A catheter ( thin tube ) is inserted into the cyst and a small container is placed under the skin    .
The fluid drains into the container and is later removed    .
Sometimes , after the cyst is drained , a drug is put through the catheter into the cyst    .
This causes the inside wall of the cyst to scar and stops the cyst from making fluid or increases the amount of the time it takes for the fluid to build up again    .
Surgery to remove the tumor may be done after the cyst is drained    .
Chemotherapy Chemotherapy is a treatment that uses anticancer drugs to stop the growth of tumor cells , either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing    .
When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle , the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach tumor cells throughout the body ( systemic chemotherapy )    .
When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid or an organ , the drugs mainly affect tumor cells in those areas ( regional chemotherapy )    .
Intracavitary chemotherapy is a type of regional chemotherapy that places drugs directly into a cavity , such as a cyst    .
It is used for craniopharyngioma that has come back after treatment    .
Biologic therapy Biologic therapy is a treatment that uses the patients immune system to fight cancer    .
Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost , direct , or restore the bodys natural defenses against cancer    .
This type of cancer treatment is also called biotherapy or immunotherapy    .
For craniopharyngioma that has come back after treatment , the biologic therapy drug is placed inside the tumor using a catheter ( intracavitary ) or in a vein ( intravenous )    .
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
For some patients , taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice    .
Clinical trials are part of the medical research process    .
Clinical trials are done to find out if new treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment    .
Many of today 's standard treatments are based on earlier clinical trials    .
Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment    .
Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way diseases will be treated in the future    .
Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments , they often answer important questions and help move research forward    .
Check the list of NCI - supported cancer clinical trials that are now accepting patients with childhood craniopharyngioma    .
For more specific results , refine the search by using other search features , such as the location of the trial , the type of treatment , or the name of the drug    .
Talk with your child 's doctor about clinical trials that may be right for your child    .
General information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website    .
Patients can enter clinical trials before , during , or after starting their treatment    .
Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment    .
Other trials test treatments for patients who have not improved    .
There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop a disease from recurring ( coming back ) or reduce the side effects of treatment    .
Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country    .
See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials    .
These have been retrieved from NCI 's clinical trials database    .
Follow - up tests may be needed    .
Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the disease or decide how to treat it may be repeated    .
Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working    .
Decisions about whether to continue , change , or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests    .
Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended    .
The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed    .
These tests are sometimes called follow - up tests or check - ups    .
After treatment , follow - up testing with MRI will be done for several years to check if the tumor has come back    .
Treatment Options for Childhood Craniopharyngioma
Newly Diagnosed Childhood Craniopharyngioma
Treatment of newly diagnosed childhood craniopharyngioma may include the following : - Surgery ( resection ) with or without radiation therapy    .

Recurrent Childhood Craniopharyngioma
Craniopharyngioma may recur ( come back ) no matter how it was treated the first time    .
Treatment options for recurrent childhood craniopharyngioma depend on the type of treatment that was given when the tumor was first diagnosed and the needs of the child    .
Treatment may include the following : - Surgery ( resection )    .
- External - beam radiation therapy    .
- Stereotactic radiosurgery    .
- Intracavitary radiation therapy    .
- Intracavitary chemotherapy or intracavitary biologic therapy    .

What is (are) Childhood Ependymoma ?

Key Points
- Childhood ependymoma is a disease in which malignant ( cancer ) cells form in the tissues of the brain and spinal cord    .
- There are different types of ependymomas    .
- The part of the brain that is affected depends on where the ependymoma forms    .
- The cause of most childhood brain tumors is unknown    .
- The signs and symptoms of childhood ependymoma are not the same in every child    .
- Tests that examine the brain and spinal cord are used to detect ( find ) childhood ependymoma    .
- Childhood ependymoma is diagnosed and removed in surgery    .
- Certain factors affect prognosis ( chance of recovery ) and treatment options    .
Childhood ependymoma is a disease in which malignant ( cancer ) cells form in the tissues of the brain and spinal cord    .
The brain controls vital functions such as memory and learning , emotion , and the senses ( hearing , sight , smell , taste , and touch )    .
The spinal cord is made up of bundles of nerve fibers that connect the brain with nerves in most parts of the body    .
Ependymomas form from ependymal cells that line the ventricles and passageways in the brain and the spinal cord    .
Ependymal cells make cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF )    .
This summary is about the treatment of primary brain tumors ( tumors that begin in the brain )    .
Treatment of metastatic brain tumors , which are tumors that begin in other parts of the body and spread to the brain , is not discussed in this summary    .
There are many different types of brain tumors    .
Brain tumors can occur in both children and adults    .
However , treatment for children is different than treatment for adults    .
See the following PDQ summaries for more information : - Childhood Brain and Spinal Cord Tumors Treatment Overview - Adult Central Nervous System Tumors Treatment
There are different types of ependymomas    .
The World Health Organization ( WHO ) groups ependymal tumors into five main subtypes : - Subependymoma ( WHO Grade I )    .
- Myxopapillary ependymoma ( WHO Grade I )    .    - Ependymoma ( WHO Grade II )    .
- RELA fusionpositive ependymoma ( WHO Grade II or Grade III with change in the RELA gene )    .
- Anaplastic ependymoma ( WHO Grade III )    .
The grade of a tumor describes how abnormal the cancer cells look under a microscope and how quickly the tumor is likely to grow and spread    .
Low - grade ( Grade I ) cancer cells look more like normal cells than high - grade cancer cells ( Grade II and III )    .
They also tend to grow and spread more slowly than Grade II and III cancer cells    .
The part of the brain that is affected depends on where the ependymoma forms    .
Ependymomas can form anywhere in the fluid - filled ventricles and passageways in the brain and spinal cord    .
Most ependymomas form in the fourth ventricle and affect the cerebellum and the brain stem    .
Once an ependymoma forms , areas of the brain that may be affected include : - Cerebrum :
The largest part of the brain , at the top of the head    .
The cerebrum controls thinking , learning , problem - solving , speech , emotions , reading , writing , and voluntary movement    .
- Cerebellum :
The lower , back part of the brain ( near the middle of the back of the head )    .
The cerebellum controls movement , balance , and posture    .
- Brain stem :
The part that connects the brain to the spinal cord , in the lowest part of the brain ( just above the back of the neck )    .
The brain stem controls breathing , heart rate , and the nerves and muscles used in seeing , hearing , walking , talking , and eating    .
- Spinal cord :
The column of nerve tissue that runs from the brain stem down the center of the back    .
It is covered by three thin layers of tissue called membranes    .
The spinal cord and membranes are surrounded by the vertebrae ( back bones )    .
Spinal cord nerves carry messages between the brain and the rest of the body , such as a message from the brain to cause muscles to move or a message from the skin to the brain to feel touch    .
What causes Childhood Ependymoma ?

The cause of most childhood brain tumors is unknown    .
What are the symptoms of Childhood Ependymoma ?

The signs and symptoms of childhood ependymoma are not the same in every child    .
Signs and symptoms depend on the following : - The child 's age    .
- Where the tumor has formed    .
Signs and symptoms may be caused by childhood ependymoma or by other conditions    .
Check with your child 's doctor if your child has any of the following : - Frequent headaches    .
- Seizures    .    - Nausea and vomiting    .
- Pain or stiffness in the neck    .
- Loss of balance or trouble walking    .
- Weakness in the legs    .
- Blurry vision    .    - Back pain    .    - A change in bowel function    .
- Trouble urinating    .
- Confusion or irritability    .
How to diagnose Childhood Ependymoma ?

Tests that examine the brain and spinal cord are used to detect ( find ) childhood ependymoma    .
The following tests and procedures may be used : - Physical exam and history :
An exam of the body to check general signs of health , including checking for signs of disease , such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual    .
A history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken    .
- Neurological exam :
A series of questions and tests to check the brain , spinal cord , and nerve function    .
The exam checks a persons mental status , coordination , and ability to walk normally , and how well the muscles , senses , and reflexes work    .
This may also be called a neuro exam or a neurologic exam    .
- MRI ( magnetic resonance imaging ) with gadolinium :
A procedure that uses a magnet , radio waves , and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the brain and spinal cord    .
A substance called gadolinium is injected into a vein and travels through the bloodstream    .
The gadolinium collects around the cancer cells so they show up brighter in the picture    .
This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging ( NMRI )    .
- Lumbar puncture : A procedure used to collect cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) from the spinal column    .
This is done by placing a needle between two bones in the spine and into the CSF around the spinal cord and removing a sample of fluid    .
The sample of CSF is checked under a microscope for signs of tumor cells    .
The sample may also be checked for the amounts of protein and glucose    .
A higher than normal amount of protein or lower than normal amount of glucose may be a sign of a tumor    .
This procedure is also called an LP or spinal tap    .
Childhood ependymoma is diagnosed and removed in surgery    .
If the diagnostic tests show there may be a brain tumor , a biopsy is done by removing part of the skull and using a needle to remove a sample of the brain tissue    .
A pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells    .
If cancer cells are found , the doctor will remove as much tumor as safely possible during the same surgery    .
The following test may be done on the tissue that was removed : - Immunohistochemistry :
A test that uses antibodies to check for certain antigens in a sample of tissue    .
The antibody is usually linked to a radioactive substance or a dye that causes the tissue to light up under a microscope    .
This type of test may be used to tell the difference between brain stem glioma and other brain tumors    .
An MRI is often done after the tumor is removed to find out whether any tumor remains    .
What is the outlook for Childhood Ependymoma ?

Certain factors affect prognosis ( chance of recovery ) and treatment options    .
The prognosis ( chance of recovery ) and treatment options depend on : - Where the tumor has formed in the central nervous system ( CNS )    .
- Whether there are certain changes in the genes or chromosomes    .
- Whether any cancer cells remain after surgery to remove the tumor    .
- The type of ependymoma    .    - The age of the child when the tumor is diagnosed    .
- Whether the cancer has spread to other parts of the brain or spinal cord    .
- Whether the tumor has just been diagnosed or has recurred ( come back )    .
Prognosis also depends on the type and dose of radiation therapy that is given    .
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Childhood Ependymoma ?

New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials    .
Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website    .
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
For some patients , taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice    .
Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process    .
Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment    .
Many of today 's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials    .
Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment    .
Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future    .
Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments , they often answer important questions and help move research forward    .
Patients can enter clinical trials before , during , or after starting their cancer treatment    .
Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment    .
Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better    .
There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring ( coming back ) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment    .
Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country    .
See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials    .
These have been retrieved from NCI 's listing of clinical trials    .
What are the stages of Childhood Ependymoma ?

Key Points
- The area where the tumor is found and the childs age are used in place of a staging system to plan cancer treatment    .
- The information from tests and procedures done to detect ( find ) childhood ependymoma is used to plan cancer treatment    .
The area where the tumor is found and the childs age are used in place of a staging system to plan cancer treatment    .
Staging is the process used to find out how much cancer there is and if cancer has spread    .
There is no standard staging system for childhood ependymoma    .
Treatment is based on where the cancer is in the body and the age of the child    .
The information from tests and procedures done to detect ( find ) childhood ependymoma is used to plan cancer treatment    .
Some of the tests used to detect childhood ependymoma are repeated after the tumor is removed by surgery    .
( See the General Information section    .    )
This is to find out how much tumor remains after surgery    .
What are the treatments for Childhood Ependymoma ?

Key Points
- There are different types of treatment for children with ependymoma    .
- Children with ependymoma should have their treatment planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating childhood brain tumors    .
- Childhood brain and spinal cord tumors may cause signs or symptoms that begin before the cancer is diagnosed and continue for months or years    .
- Some cancer treatments cause side effects months or years after treatment has ended    .
- Four types of standard treatment are used : - Surgery - Radiation therapy - Chemotherapy - Observation - New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials    .
- Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
- Patients can enter clinical trials before , during , or after starting their cancer treatment    .
- Follow - up tests may be needed    .
There are different types of treatment for children with ependymoma    .
Different types of treatment are available for children with ependymoma    .
Some treatments are standard ( the currently used treatment ) , and some are being tested in clinical trials    .
A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer    .
When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment , the new treatment may become the standard treatment    .
Because cancer in children is rare , taking part in a clinical trial should be considered    .
Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment    .
Children with ependymoma should have their treatment planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating childhood brain tumors    .
Treatment will be overseen by a pediatric oncologist , a doctor who specializes in treating children with cancer    .
The pediatric oncologist works with other pediatric health care providers who are experts in treating children with brain tumors and who specialize in certain areas of medicine    .
These may include the following specialists : - Pediatric neurosurgeon    .
- Neurologist    .    - Neuropathologist    .
- Neuroradiologist    .
- Pediatrician    .    - Rehabilitation specialist    .
- Radiation oncologist    .
- Medical oncologist    .
- Endocrinologist    .    - Psychologist    .
Childhood brain and spinal cord tumors may cause signs or symptoms that begin before the cancer is diagnosed and continue for months or years    .
Childhood brain and spinal cord tumors may cause signs or symptoms that continue for months or years    .
Signs or symptoms caused by the tumor may begin before diagnosis    .
Signs or symptoms caused by treatment may begin during or right after treatment    .
Some cancer treatments cause side effects months or years after treatment has ended    .
These are called late effects    .
Late effects of cancer treatment may include the following : - Physical problems    .
- Changes in mood , feelings , thinking , learning , or memory    .
- Second cancers ( new types of cancer )    .
Some late effects may be treated or controlled    .
It is important to talk with your child 's doctors about the effects cancer treatment can have on your child    .
( See the PDQ summary on Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer for more information )    .
Four types of standard treatment are used :
Surgery
If the results of diagnostic tests show there may be a brain tumor , a biopsy is done by removing part of the skull and using a needle to remove a sample of the brain tissue    .
A pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to check for cancer cells    .
If cancer cells are found , the doctor will remove as much tumor as safely possible during the same surgery    .
An MRI is often done after the tumor is removed to find out whether any tumor remains    .
If tumor remains , a second surgery to remove as much of the remaining tumor as possible may be done    .
Even if the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery , some patients may be given chemotherapy or radiation therapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left    .
Treatment to lower the risk that the cancer will come back after surgery is called adjuvant therapy    .
Radiation therapy Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high - energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing    .
There are two types of radiation therapy : - External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer    .
Certain ways of giving radiation therapy can help keep radiation from damaging nearby healthy tissue    .
These types of radiation therapy include the following : - Conformal radiation therapy : Conformal radiation therapy is a type of external radiation therapy that uses a computer to make a 3 - dimensional ( 3 - D ) picture of the tumor and shapes the radiation beams to fit the tumor    .
- Intensity - modulated radiation therapy ( IMRT ) : IMRT is a type of 3 - dimensional ( 3 - D ) radiation therapy that uses a computer to make pictures of the size and shape of the tumor    .
Thin beams of radiation of different intensities ( strengths ) are aimed at the tumor from many angles    .
- Proton - beam radiation therapy : Proton - beam therapy is a type of high - energy , external radiation therapy    .
A radiation therapy machine aims streams of protons ( tiny , invisible , positively - charged particles ) at the cancer cells to kill them    .
- Stereotactic radiosurgery : Stereotactic radiosurgery is a type of external radiation therapy    .
A rigid head frame is attached to the skull to keep the head still during the radiation treatment    .
A machine aims a single large dose of radiation directly at the tumor    .
This procedure does not involve surgery    .
It is also called stereotaxic radiosurgery , radiosurgery , and radiation surgery    .
- Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles , seeds , wires , or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer    .
The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type of cancer being treated    .
External radiation therapy is used to treat childhood ependymoma    .
Children younger than 3 years who receive radiation therapy to the brain have a higher risk of problems with growth and development than older children    .
3 - D conformal radiation therapy and proton - beam therapy are being studied in children younger than 3 years to see if the effects of radiation on growth and development are lessened    .
Chemotherapy Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells , either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing    .
When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle , the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body ( systemic chemotherapy )    .
When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid , an organ , or a body cavity such as the abdomen , the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas ( regional chemotherapy )    .
The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type of cancer being treated    .
Observation Observation is closely monitoring a patients condition without giving any treatment until signs or symptoms appear or change    .
Observation may be used to treat a child with a subependymoma who has no symptoms and whose tumor is found while treating another condition    .
New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials    .
Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website    .
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial    .
For some patients , taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice    .

Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working    .
Decisions about whether to continue , change , or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests    .
Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended    .
The results of these tests can show if your child 's condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred ( come back )    .
These tests are sometimes called follow - up tests or check - ups    .
Follow - up tests for childhood ependymoma include an MRI ( magnetic resonance imaging ) of the brain and spinal cord every 3 months for the first 1 or 2 years after treatment    .
After 2 years , MRIs may be done every 6 months for the next 3 years    .
Treatment Options for Childhood Ependymoma
Newly Diagnosed Childhood Ependymoma
A child with a newly diagnosed ependymoma has not had treatment for the tumor    .
The child may have had treatment to relieve signs or symptoms caused by the tumor    .
Subependymoma
Treatment of newly diagnosed subependymoma ( WHO Grade I ) is : - Surgery    .    - Observation ( rarely )    .
Myxopapillary ependymoma
Treatment of newly diagnosed myxopapillary ependymoma ( WHO Grade I ) is : - Surgery with or without radiation therapy    .
Childhood ependymoma , anaplastic ependymoma , or RELA fusionpositive ependymoma Treatment of newly diagnosed childhood ependymoma ( WHO Grade II ) , anaplastic ependymoma ( WHO Grade III ) , or RELA fusionpositive ependymoma ( WHO Grade II or Grade III ) is : - Surgery    .
After surgery , the plan for further treatment depends on the following : - Whether any cancer cells remain after surgery    .
